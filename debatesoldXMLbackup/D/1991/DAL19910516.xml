      <P>On the Order of Business generally, may I ask the Taoiseach, in respect of the judical inquiry into the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme which was promised at the last minute by the Government last night, if the Opposition parties in the House will be consulted on the terms of reference before this is presented to the House in order to ensure that the terms of reference are sufficiently wide and that the powers of the inquiry are sufficiently great to get to the bottom <Col N="1354" /> of this matter, in its entirely, once and for all?  Will the Government agree that it might be wise to consult in regard to this motion in advance to avoid a repetition of the situation which emerged last night in regard to the Government's original motion on the matter?</P>

      <P>The last thing anybody on this side of the House wants to get involved in is a row with you, Sir; any arguments we have are with the other side. However, I should like to know when the motion to establish a judicial inquiry will come before the House and whether time will be permitted for the consultations <Col N="1355" /> which are necessary to ensure that the inquiry terms of reference are adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated last night, it is hoped to bring the order before the House next week but I must point out to the House that setting up a judicial inquiry of this kind is a complex business which will require careful study and full consultation with the legal advisers to the Government.  It is the Government's responsibility to bring the motion to the House and the House can then decide whether it wishes to debate the terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that there is nothing to vote on on the Order of Business but I want to point out to the Taoiseach that we are about to consider Report Stage of very important legislation. When Committee Stage was brought to a conclusion at 11.20 p.m. last night only 26 amendments out of more than 300 and only four sections out of 55 had been discussed.  The Chair's office and staff have been put under enormous pressure as a result of this procedure.  A few minutes ago the Chief Whip of our party who is spokesperson on local government, received a letter from the Chair to the effect that other amendments will be addressed during the course of the day.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that it is unfair on the Chair's office, the staff and Members of the House to propose that the Bill be discussed in this manner. That is not the way to do business.</P>

      <P>Each day since the Bill was introduced it has been stated that the amount of time made available was unsatisfactory.  I would like to move under Standing Order 143: that the order in relation to the Local Government Bill be suspended.  That is a matter of urgency and, therefore, does not require a notice of motion.  I am proposing this motion because only one-tenth of the Members&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister also indicated that he would get the advice of the Attorney General.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 6, after &ldquo;GOVERNMENT&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;AND TO ENABLE THE MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT TO EFFECT CERTAIN REFORMS&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What I seek to do in this amendment is to change the title of this Bill from &ldquo;An Act to amend and extend the law relating to local government&rdquo; and to add &ldquo;and to enable the Minister for the Environment to effect certain reforms&rdquo;.  It is significant that many of us have spent a very long time preparing amendments at short notice.  We have gone through 27 of the 300 amendments tabled by Opposition parties on a Bill which, as I said earlier, will determine the structures for local government for years to come.</P>
      <P>Many of us on this side of the House feel frustrated because clearly the Minister is not of a mind to accept amendments, no matter how well argued or logical they may be.  He is determined to bulldoze through this House in the shortest possible time very comprehensive legislation that does not bring about local government reform or a devolution of powers to local authorities but brings to himself a whole range of new authorities and powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have only begun to scratch the surface of this Bill in recent days and it has underscored very clearly that the fears we expressed from the very beginning, that the Bill was far from reforming legislation, are all true.  I deeply regret <Col N="1364" /> that the Minister and the Government have refused to allow adequate time to Deputies on this side of the House and to his own backbenchers &mdash; if any of them have an interest in local government, but it does not seem they have from their attendance over the past few days &mdash; to bring some measure of reform into this Bill and to make it workable.  I deeply regret also that Members on this side are clearly not going to make any changes because the Minister has the numbers and has a fixed mind on the issue.  The only thing we can hope to do is to alert the general public to what exactly is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the efforts made by this side of the House got scant coverage in the media.  The endless hours we have put in in recent days to try to reveal the damage being done by this Bill and to underscore the hidden agenda of the Bill have gone largley unreported.  I regret that very much.  We would get some satisfaction at least from being able to say we have done a good job if the people were alerted to the dangers inherent in this Bill because this Minister and the Government refused us the opportunity to make meaningful changes.</P>
    <P>Before we continue with this sham &mdash; and it is increasingly clear that that is what it is &mdash; let me say the Government are not interested in this Bill.  They have put together a measure largley to satisfy a promise they made to introduce local government reform prior to the local elections.  At the hustings they can say they kept their promise in the hope that the public will not be alerted to the reality that not only have they not kept their promise, but they betrayed the trust of the people in relation to the many aspects of the reforms and the real devolution of powers promised.</P>
    <P>Let us begin this Report Stage debate by addressing that reality.  Let us begin by putting in a new Title, a definitive Title.  It is not an Act to extend the law relating to local government; it is an Act to enable the Minister for the Environment to effect changes.  The Bill gives him the powers to do a range of things by order, by regulation.  The devolution <Col N="1365" /> of powers that he lauded widely at press conferences and during his Second Stage speech are a pretence and are seen to be shallow and hollow when he puts a range of obstacles in the face of the real devolution of power.  The Minister has no intention of allowing one whit of control to escape the Custom House.  That is patently clear.</P>
    <P>The issue of funding, which we discussed at length, is not addressed in this Bill.  I do not want to take up time because we have a lot of work to do, but we should start off on the basis of reality.  Since we cannot achieve anything by way of change, let us underscore to the best of our ability the effects of the Bill to the people outside.  Now that other issues are not detracting from this debate today, I hope this fundamental legislation &mdash; and few Bills are of more fundamental importance because we are putting in place the layer of democratic accountability for local government &mdash; will be seen to be a sham.  Let us put that down in black and white for the world to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the provisions of this Bill are merely semantic and to call them reforms is a mistake.  For that reason I consider the amendment tabled by Deputy Howlin as semantic, as are many of his 163 amendments which have clogged up the Order Paper and obscured very real issues, some of which have been addresed extremely well by Deputy Howlin.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with his criticism of the media coverage because that has been quite extensive, and last Saturday <i>The Irish Times</i> covered detailed analysis of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been debating the Committee Stage for the past three days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good exposé in the papers of the issues involved.  My main criticism is of the way the Government have sought to bring in a Bill which has very far-reaching powers. When I pointed that out, as did Deputy Howlin and Deputy Gilmore, during the <Col N="1366" /> first 24 hours of the debate, the press briefings by the Minister and his colleagues, the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, and the Government press secretary were to the effect that we had misread the Bill.  That line was bought by a number of commentators even though what had happened was that the Ministers had misread the Bill and the Opposition's reading of it was correct.</P>
      <P>To call this Bill, as Deputy Howlin proposes, &ldquo;An Act to amend and extend the law relating to Local Government and to enable the Minister for the Environment to effect certain reforms&rdquo; would give the Minister some cover.  The present Title, &ldquo;An Act to amend and extend the law relating to Local Government,&rdquo; is more accurate as that is what the Minister is doing; he is extending the law relating to local government and extending his powers dramatically.</P>
      <P>Some people may ask, what is in a name?  It can be very symbolic and significant and the title chosen by the Minister outlines what he is doing; he is extending the law relating to local government, which is a mistake.  The Minister should be trying to extract himself from local government and allow local government and local people discretion over local affairs.  He should reinvigorate local government and restore to it some purpose and vigour. Those of us who have had any connection with this area know that the reality of local government for the past number of years has been one of enormous lethargy, aimlessness and ineffectiveness.  This is because even simple decisions on which recreational grant should be met is decided by the Minister, whether it is in Ballydehob or Ballymaloe.  The present Title is much more accurate than the one proposed in Deputy Howlin's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to restore to local government some of the discretion they used to have. He should delete those sections of the Bill which will enable the Minister to <Col N="1367" /> intrude into such minor matters as twinning between local authorities, the granting of civic honours and chairmen and councillors' allowances and expenses.  If he were to delete those provisions he would show that he does not really want to control the minutiae of every aspect of local government.  Even though those changes would be largely symbolic, they would somewhat redeem the Bill.</P>
    <P>I know that many people do not think too much about local government. However, they do think about the quality of life as their everyday lives are affected by the quality of the environment.  More than the other II EC countries, people in Ireland have lost control and influence over their local environment.  They have no say in it.  That is why we have extensive urban blight &mdash; particularly in Dublin within a mile of this House &mdash; which has gone on for years.  This happened because local people lost their power and influence over these matters and cannot effect change or exert pressure to have them put right.</P>
    <P>This is happening throughout the country. People have no say in the provision of public lighting, the removal of a derelict site or dangerous building or the provision and maintenance of parks.  One had more control over these things when I was a councillor in the seventies.  These issues are now almost beyond the power of county councils &mdash; the same line is trotted out by all managers &mdash; there are no funds.  This line has been used as an excuse for every inefficiency, every lack of initiative and lack of energy in local authorities.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the question of funding was missed.  When Fine Gael stood their ground and did not agree to an all-party committee on local government reform because it left out the question of funding, we were not supported by the other parties.  We were the only party who said at that time that such a committee would be meaningless unless it addressed the issue of local government funding.  We have been derided for that decision and accused of holding up local government reform.  However, the <Col N="1368" /> reality is that reform and changes mean nothing unless the question of funding is addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on the Local Government Bill is degenerating by the hour; it is becoming a pretence.  Between now and 4.30 p.m. today we will pretend to debate 261 Report Stage amendments, most of which we will not reach.  We spent two days engaged in a pretence of a Committee Stage debate, a debate which was supposed to take us line by line through the Bill and tease out the detail of what is proposed by the Minister. The reality is that we got as far as section 4 and 51 sections were not teased out at all by this House.  This is not the fault of those who have been here over the past two to three days engaged in this debate.  It is the fault of the Government who have reduced this debate to a farce and have brought about a situation where this House has been given no real role in discussing the form of local government which will exist for the next 25 years or so.</P>
      <P>We need to contrast this with a number of points.  First, we need to contrast it with the fact that local government has not been reorganised for over 100 years. The main local government legislation &mdash; some sections of which are proposed to be repealed by this Bill &mdash; go back to 1840.  For the first time in the history of the State, we are addressing the question of new types of local government structures and repealing Victorian legislation which was introduced by a previous Administration in a previous century when, as the Minister put it, roads were the preserve of the horse and cart. However, the national Parliament has not been given any real opportunity to debate the issues before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to contrast this with the time it has taken to bring this Bill before the House.  Local government reform has been under discussion in this State for the past 20 years or more &mdash; I think the first report was in 1971.  At every postponement of local elections Governments spoke about reorganising local government.  The question of local <Col N="1369" /> government reform was so important that the local elections had to be postponed 12 months ago.  The people's democratic right to elect their councillors on a five year basis, which was provided for in the 1973 Local Government Act, had to be set aside as the question of reforming local government was so important.</P>
    <P>The expert committee were given initially the period between May and September to address the very complex questions that are involved in local government reorganisation.  The expert committee found they could not do it in that time &mdash; and these are people who have a lifetime of knowledge dealing with local government &mdash; and they had that time for addressing these issues extended and they eventually made a very good report by December.  It took them eight months to produce their views on local government.</P>

      <P>The Chair is prepared to allow a certain amount of latitude when dealing with this amendment in Deputy Howin's name concerning the Title of the Bill, but I would dissuade Members from embarking upon what seems to be very wide ranging speeches more appropriate to the Second Reading of the Bill which is long past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing myself to the Title of the Bill.  It is now down to a choice between whether we call it a Bill to extend local government or add the terms proposed by Deputy Howlin to enable the Minister for the Environment to effect certain reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Title does raise the way in which this legislation is being brought before us because while normally it would be correct that we would apply ourselves in a very blinkered way to the individual amendments as they are proposed, I am simply drawing attention to the fact that there is no way in the course of today's discussions that we can address the detail of this Bill through the 261 amendments we have before us.  I am simply drawing attention to the contrast between the <Col N="1370" /> amount of time we are given as parliamentarians to address the Bill and the time it took the Bill to come before us.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the length of time it took for the report to be produced, that the Government took a further two months to make up their mind about it and a further two months again to produce the Bill.  Then it was given to us to deal with in a matter of a couple of days.  I am simply drawing attention to it because this will be repeated during the course of the day.  This is farcical; it is absurd; we are here pretending that we are addressing the detail of this Bill when we know very well we have no possibility of getting through the detail of the Bill in the course of the day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised a couple of questions about his own party's approach to the question of local government reform.  It should be put on record that the way this Bill is being put through the House has been to some extent contributed to by the approach of the Fine Gael Party.  We all share a certain degree of scepticism when asked to participate in all party committees, but to refuse to participate in the Bill as Fine Gael did was quite negative.  I think it arose from a time when Fine Gael were more interested in appearing to be macho than in addressing issues of policy, and that is very much to be regretted.  I think also that the extent to which the Minister has been able to get off the hook on the appalling nature of this Bill which so undermines local government and transfers powers to himself has been contributed to in part by the degree of overstatement Deputy Mitchell engaged in immediately after the Bill was produced &mdash; and I am sorry Deputy Mitchell is not here to hear this.</P>
    <P>We certainly criticised this Bill for undermining local government, for transferring powers to the Minister for the Environment.  That is perfectly clear from the detail of the Bill and will become painfully clear as the years go on and local government attempts to operate under this Bill.  The degree of over-statement about and the extent of the transfer of powers enabled the Minister to get off <Col N="1371" /> the hook to some extent and that is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Howlin's amendment because it more accurately describes what this Bill is about.  I very much regret that we have engaged in a pretence of a debate over the past two to three days and that that pretence will continue today.  This is no way to deal with establishing democratic structures in this State.  People want to be involved in decision making as it affects their own lives at local level.  They want to be involved in controlling the services that are supplied to them at local level.  There is increasing frustration on the part of people at local level because they have no control over a whole range of services provided to them whether it is the police &mdash; and I appreciate the police are outside the remit of local government although that is not so in other countries &mdash; the repair of public lighting, the repair and maintenance of the roads, works carried out in their neighbourhood, planning issues water supply etc.  There is growing frustration among the public that they do not have this control and that frustration is reflected within the political parties. It is a fact that many member of the Minister's party who have been councillors have simply given up in frustration. I know of Fianna Fáil councillors who are not standing for re-election because they believe there is no point in it, they have no real control or any real say.</P>
    <P>Every political party in this State &mdash; and it is time the political parties acknowledged this &mdash; has experienced difficulty obtaining candidates for local elections this year because there is a perception among the public and among people who are active in politics that there is no point being elected to local authorities which have very limited powers, which are starved of finance, which are overridden by appointed officials rather than run by the elected councillors and which now, under this Bill, are to be overridden by ministerial dictat.</P>
    <P>It is the ultimate undermining of local government that there is no great rush among the public or among members of <Col N="1372" /> political parties to participate in the process. That is a sign that local democracy is being gradually eroded and gradually undermined in this State and, unfortunately, far from remedying that, this Bill will compound it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to get Deputy Gilmore's remarks about Deputy Mitchell's reaction to the Bill out of the way.  The only fault I found with Deputy Mitchell's reaction to the Bill was that it gave the Bill a credence it did not deserve.  Deputy Mitchell was right to draw attention to the anomalies in the Bill from the beginning.  He did a service in alerting the general public to the dangers of this Bill.  If there was any fault with Deputy Mitchell's contribution it was that it might have made people think this Bill was about something when it has turned out to be about very little.  I have no quibble with the Title of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It does not matter what it is called. This legislation is about so little that its title is insignificant, unless, of course, it is given a name that would alert the people to what it is.  It could be called &ldquo;The Excuse For The Reform Of Local Government Bill&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Lost Chance For The Reform Of Local Government Bill&rdquo;, or something equally sensational. Such a title would draw properly to the attention of the general public that the Bill is a lost opportunity.</P>
      <P>There is nothing about real reform of local government in the Bill.  I am a councillor of 16 years' standing &mdash; 17 years this year &mdash; and there is nothing in the Bill to help make my tasks as a councillor any more interesting or to help me do my job any better.  As Deputy Gilmore said, it is no wonder that so many county councillors &mdash; in my own county there are at least eight, most from the Government party &mdash; are not willing to stand again. At least five members of Galway Corporation, more than one-third of its membership, are not willing to stand again for local government.  The reason is that they are frustrated at being in local government, and the Bill has been the a last straw for them in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> When the local elections were postponed a year ago, some hope was held that real reform of local government would take place.  Instead of that, there has been this non-event of a Bill.  What is in the Bill?  Will the Bill do anything to provide one more local authority house? I ask the Minister what in the Bill will do anything about the roads in County Galway or any other county.  Despite any assurances given by the Minister in the papers, on television, or anywhere else, my county engineer told me yesterday that because of a lack of money this year he will be able to carry out only one-tenth of the necessary maintenance on county roads in the electoral area I represent.  I challenge the Minister to deny that reality anywhere.  He can have all the meetings he likes with county managers and try to distract attention from the real issue of not providing money for local authorities. For the first few days I went through the Bill and searched in vain for a glimmer of hope of it providing services in the counties.  I was a sadly disappointed to find nothing of that kind in the Bill.  The title of the Bill really does not matter unless it is called the non-event of the term of the present Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>I take it that the House is dealing with amendment No. 1 and the long title of the Bill, although one would be forgiven for thinking that the House was back on Second Stage.  That is an illustration of the way in which Opposition Members have dealt with the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been leading the charge that way, but, then, he has been going backwards for sometime.  The words proposed for addition to the long title are unnecessary.  The legislation will be a Local Government Act, and there have been well over 20 Local Government Acts.  The long title: &ldquo;An Act to amend and extend the law relating to local government&rdquo;, describes perfectly <Col N="1374" /> well what the Bill does.  I hope that Deputies do not intend to press this point, because it is not substantial.  Yesterday Deputy Howlin himself admitted that the amendment was not substantial, but he seems to persist in pursuing the point for some strange reason.  He raised a similar issue yesterday in relation to the short title.  I must point out that contrary to what the amendments states, the Bill contains provisions that are not enabling ones but have effect directly from its enactment.  The Deputy is therefore factually incorrect.</P>

The recommendation further states that the legislation should set out the broad local government framework and allow for necessary consequential changes to be implemented by way of statutory order.  I agree.  That is <Col N="1376" /> what the Bill sets out to do.

      <P>Yesterday Deputy Gilmore contributed significantly himself to the slow pace taken on Committee Stage, and it seems that he insists on doing the same today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday's Committee Stage could be called nothing short of a mini-Second Stage.  Deputies wandered away from every single amendment that was discussed. They included references to other sections; they are quite entitled to do that, of course, but they dwelt on some of those other sections at quite some length. The indication was that if there was to be insufficient time to talk about other sections then those sections would be spoken about in contributions made to every amendment that Members spoke on.  Such a procedure yesterday meant that on Committee Stage not as much work was done as would have been wished.  Some Opposition contributions went well beyond what would be regarded as normal and practical with a view to getting business done, and that <Col N="1377" /> point was reflected upon by some Opposition Members themselves.  Similar activity should not be allowed to continue today.</P>
    <P>Many of the sections that the Government would have liked to discuss were referred to anyway and were incorporated into a great deal of the work done yesterday.  That attitude was not conducive towards getting the desired reforms put in place.  Doubts were raised in my mind as to some Deputies' commitment to having a reform programme put in place at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some criticism in one of the lengthy contributions before you came back to the Chair, Sir, about the delays in achieving this.  Deputy Gilmore is quite right.  We have been some time waiting for this legislation, going back to the 1971 White Paper.  We referred to that on a previous occasion. It has taken some time to get to this stage and it has been made abundantly clear that this is the first piece of such legislation but there will be many others over a period of years.  That is the way local government reform should evolve.  It cannot happen overnight.  Everybody was aware of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

      <P>What is the Minister going to do about regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; but we have made a substantial start by the introduction of this legislation.  I accept the regret expressed about the tardiness of the main Opposition party to participate in a joint committee.  It would have been a preferable way of doing business, but did not happen.  Unfortunately, that led to a delay in getting on to the business.  After some eight or nine months of non-cooperation we thought it might happen eventually but it did not.  Deputy Gilmore put a set of reasons on the record as to the non-willingness of the major Opposition party to participate.  However, I have other reasons which are not required to be put on the record this morning.  There was a delay, but in ten months we set up the Cabinet sub-committee of which I was chairman.  We established the expert advisory committee.  They reported&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Government sub-committee considered that report. They made a report to Government and the Government considered that report. We outlined our programme on 7 March of this year.  We promised legislation at <Col N="1379" /> that time and we delivered on it.  It was not a bad effort in ten months and I think Deputies will be generous enough to recognise that.</P>
      <P>Deputies Mitchell and Gilmore have quite an extraordinary perception of the role of local councillors.  They seem to think the managers are all powerful in every aspect of activity local authorities are involved in.  Have they ever taken the trouble and time to read the managerial Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  It is total nonsense to suggest that.  It is not what the law provides.  If individual councillors are not willing to use the powers they have, perhaps there is a need to put on record exactly what those powers are, and if one had time one could do that. Members who are also councillors should not complain that they cannot achieve this or that or do whatever they would like because of lack of power.  The quite extensive powers available to councillors if they are willing to use them are there in black and white in existing legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. There are some councillors who do not wish to use their existing powers and the Deputy knows why as well as I do.  He is talking about giving them extra powers. Some of those powers do not have to be given because the councillors have them already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to one item Deputy <Col N="1380" /> Mitchell persisted in referring to yesterday and this morning.  It is well to get it off the deck once and for all.  He keeps talking about civic honours and twinning as examples of ministerial interference. Somehow he seems to suggest the Minister is overstepping the mark in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 48 deals with civic honours and provides for action by way of reserved function &mdash; that applies in the case of boroughs now.  There is no provision and no scope for ministerial direction or involvement, and the Deputy should recognise that.  I have to be careful that I too do not drift into that bad practice.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, when the Deputies insist on making mini Second Stage contributions on every amendment they will be disappointed if the Minister does not respond to individual arguments and they will complain that he is not giving a fair answer to this, that and the other.  We had that <i>ad nauseam</i> yesterday on another section and I hope it will not be repeated today.</P>

I am tempted to comment on some of the statements from the other Opposition party but in deference to my own admonition to get on with the business, I will resist that.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 36, after &ldquo;therewith&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;,unless it conflicts with a valid direction of a local authority under section 4 of the City and County Management Act, 1955,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from the discussion we had here yesterday which was really the only serious Committee Stage discussion that took place.  Section 3 (8) reads: &ldquo;A person to whom a direction is given under this Act shall comply therewith&rdquo;. This question arose yesterday and it was very clear from the Minister's initial reaction that he was not sure what the situation would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would the manager and officials do if they were in receipt, on the one hand, of a valid section 4 direction, under section 4 of the City and County Management Act, 1955, from the elected representatives and they were in possession <Col N="1382" /> of a direction under this Act which was in conflict with that section 4?  As the discussion proceeded the Minister lost his initial doubt and became very assertive that there was no possibility of conflict. The Minister may be right but I am not persuaded.  I think there is room for doubt and that there could be conflict.  It could very well be that officials could find themselves in a quandary.  It could also be a matter for the High Court to resolve as to which of the two directions was superior, which was the more valid and which one the local management should comply with.  The amendment I have put down clarifies the position and I would urge the Minister to accept it.  Subsection (8) would then read as follows:</P>
    <P>A person to whom a direction is given under this Act shall comply therewith, unless it conflicts with a valid direction of a local authority under section 4 of the City and County Management Act, 1955....</P>
    <P>I do not think that is unreasonable.  On the face of it, it gives superiority to a direction under section 4 by the elected council rather than to a direction from the Minister.  When you read the rest of this Bill, you find that the Minister has such extensive powers to withdraw from the local authorities certain functions, that, unfortunately, it in no way diminishes the power of the Minister.  I say &ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo; because he has taken on to himself far too much power.  If the Minister were to accept the amendment it would help to clarify the section and would be of great help to all public servants in local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this issue yesterday and I am pleased that Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Allen have tabled an amendment in regard to it because it will help to clarify the position.  I raised the possible conflict that could arise if, under the provisions of section 4 of the City and County Management Act, a local authority made one particular decision and gave one direction to a county manager &mdash; which they are entitled to do under section 4 of the 1955 <Col N="1383" /> Act &mdash; and if the Minister gave a direction which conflicted with that.  We dealt with several examples yesterday ranging from the Carrickmines sewer to the location of travellers' halting sites to the building of walls.  What would happen in a situation where the local authority wanted to do one thing and gave that direction to the county manager and the Minister wanted to do a different thing?  In reply the Minister said that would not arise because the only directions the Minister would be giving would arise from this Act.</P>
      <P>This legislation covers a fairly wide range of areas dealing with devolution of functions, the establishment of new authorities, the Dublin situation and so on.  Section 3 which governs all of this gives the Minister all embracing power to make regulations, to issue directions and so on.  It is conceivable, in my view, that a situation could arise whereby the Minister would be telling the county manager to do one thing and the county council would be telling him to do something else.  We need to have the position absolutely clear, that in those situations the county manager does not have to comply with a direction of the Minister if it conflicts with the direction he has been given by the democratically elected council. What is at issue here is the question of who the county manager is accountable to.  Is the county manager accountable to the Minister or to the county council?  A choice has to be made on that issue.  If local democracy is to mean anything then we have to state the primacy of the elected local council to give a direction to the county manager.  That is what the proposed amendment seeks to achieve and I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter on which I would take issue with Deputy Mitchell: that is his statement when introducing his amendment, that this was the only serious debate which had taken place in the course of Committee Stage.  I take issue with that statement.  That was not the case.  We had a lengthy and serious debate on many aspects of the Bill but, of course, Deputy Mitchell would not have been aware of that since he was <Col N="1384" /> absent for a large part of the Committee Stage debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is crucial to the whole Bill.  It pinpoints the dilemma of many councillors and managers throughout the country if no amendment is made to this section.  The Minister indicated from the beginning that he wished to give power back to the people on the ground.  If this matter is not clarified that power will be taken from the people.  Having studied the amendment and the section I am convinced that clarification is necessary. Many councillors have indicated that section 4 was a last resort to put forward what they would regard as the proper means to tackle a particular problem in a particular place.  If the Minister can override section 4, what he has said up to now will not mean very much to the people who are seeking reform.  This matter needs to be clarified.  The amendment is important and crucial and should be given careful consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (8) of section 3 was amended yesterday to take account of the points raised by the Deputies opposite.  It now reads:</P>
      <P>A person to whom a direction is given under this Act shall comply therewith.</P>
      <P>The key point to be made is that the direction must be given pursuant to this Act, not to any other Act.  There seemed to be a little confusion about that yesterday so we must at least state; for clarification that it must be pursuant to this Act and not to any other Act.  It can only relate to matters covered by this Act and this is a Local Government Bill dealing with various matters and provides a reserve power for directions in certain cases for any purposes of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday we had discussions, as Deputy Gilmore said, on all kinds of hypothetical cases relating to sewers, halting sites, planning permissions, footpaths and so on, these are all matters dealt with under other codes of law, not by this Local Government Bill.  It is <Col N="1385" /> simply not possible to issue directions in respect of such matters under this legislation. The question of a direction being at variance or contradictory to a section 4 direction simply does not arise.  A direction under this Act could not be given in the cases mentioned.  On that account I would ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.  I might add also that the section 4 power is contained in the management Acts and not in the local government code.  If a section 4 direction complies with the law and with the procedures set out in the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, it is valid, and nothing the Minister could do would render it invalid.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot give directions on specific matters under this Bill which override housing law, planning law, sanitary services law, derelict sites or fire services' codes or indeed any of the codes that apply to local authorities.  Directions can only be given for this Bill where a section 4 direction is given.  It is given under the Management Acts and the Minister cannot interfere with that.  I believe that is sufficient clarification to put at rest the doubts expressed.  I thought we had disposed of this matter satisfactorily yesterday but because it has been raised again this morning I have cleared it up positively and I would ask the Deputies to withdraw their amendments.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore got a little nasty and took exception to the fact that I said, when moving the amendment, that the debate on this matter was the only serious discussion on Committee Stage.  What I intended to convey was that this matter was teased out at great length in a Committee Stage type debate. There were significant debates on other matters during Committee Stage but they were more of a Second Stage type.  That does not mean they were not valuable; a lot of the debate was very valuable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to this amendment, if the Minister is happy that any valid direction of a local authority under section 4 of the 1955 Act is superior to his directions, why will he not accept the amendment? That is what makes me unconvinced.  This amendment would clarify precisely what the Minister claims is the case anyway, but about which many of us on this side of the House have grave doubts.  I would ask the Minister to be forthcoming and to show he is prepared to have this Bill improved even in the constrained Committee Stage and Report Stage debates we are having.  I intend to press this amendment because it would put beyond doubt that the one real power the local council have is retained, that is power to direct anything that is legal under section 4.  It is a reserved power which is very important <Col N="1387" /> and is one of the few powers left to councils. Unless this amendment is accepted that power under section 4 could be further eroded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with the functions of local authorities and the new definition of functions being put in by the Minister.  The Minister's opening subsection is very banal and meaningless, to put it at its kindest.  Under the definition included in the section a local authority may represent the interests of the local community in such manner as he thinks appropriate.  What does that mean?  I said on Committee Stage that the Minister should elucidate on that.  He was not anxious to define local communities or to represent the interests of local communities and there are no definitions in the Bill in this regard.  He did not want to include the definition I proposed or to suggest an alternative and the section as it stands means nothing.  It needs to be spelt out what exactly is meant by &ldquo;represents the interests of the local community&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to try to put flesh on those very bare bones and my amendment seeks to delete &ldquo;may represent the interests of the local community in such manner as it thinks appropriate&rdquo; and substitute the fleshed out definition contained in the amendment.  That is easily understood and clear, it tells local authorities what the Oireachtas means what it says that you should not represent local communities. The other amendment involved a charge on the Exchequer but it would have broadened the intention and the meaning of the Bill because as it stands <Col N="1391" /> it means nothing and there is no obligation on a local authority member to do anything.  I am suggesting a form of words that spells out in reasonable detail what they are expected to do and what they can do.  If the powers, scope and functions of local authorities are extended, the Minister will move in the direction I suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with amendment No. 4 as it is similar to amendment No. 5 which we would withdraw if amendment No. 4 were accepted.  Deputy Howlin has fleshed out the principle which we wanted to have included in the Bill.  I am a member of a local authority in Cork and we have a development sub-committee comprising external groups, community associations, residents' associations and youth groups.  However, despite our best efforts it comes down to &ldquo;them and us&rdquo;. The local authority is seen as being remote from the thinking of the people and that must be tackled if local government is to be effective.</P>
      <P>I hope that if this amendment is accepted by the Minister it will encourage &mdash; indeed ensure &mdash; that all local authorities would set up lines of communication. This would avoid conflict in regard to issues which arise.  I am thinking of the plan to build a car park in the Marsh area.  The conflict could have been avoided if proper structures had been in place.  It was really nobody's fault that conflicts arose, it was just, as I said, because of the lack of proper structures to consult the community on their views on issues which affected their everyday life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another source of conflict was the Blackpool flyover which cut through an old community.  Again the structures were inadequate to deal with people's concern.  Communities should be able to respond to environmental impact studies. A fairly comprehensive detailed study was undertaken by a local authority in relation to the impact of development on the community but, when it was published, the community only had one month to digest what effect it would have <Col N="1392" /> on them.  A period of one month was totally inadequate as they wished to consult their own technical and legal advisers, but the Minister would not extend the time.  That is why there was conflict, which could have been avoided, if there had been flexibility and proper structures in place which would have allowed consultation at all levels.  This amendment would remedy that and I urge the Minister to accept it.  If this had been the case all along, developments which have been delayed, could have been started.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the representational functions of local authorities and it seems that, as it stands at present, it does not change the existing situation in relation to local authorities because there is nothing to prevent local authorities making representations on behalf of their communites.  It happens every month of the year at local authority meetings &mdash; motions are taken by members of local authorities that a letter be sent to the Minister for Education about a school in the locality, to the Minister for the Marine about a fish farming licence or some other matter of concern to the community.  At council meetings we regularly get copies of letters which have been sent from other local authorities about all kinds of matters concerning the members of that authority.</P>
      <P>It is the way this function has been carried out by local authorities that has given rise to derogatory comment such as &ldquo;Ballymagashery&rdquo; in that when members of a local authority do not like a particular television programme they decide to represent the interests of the local community by drawing the attention of the Government or of the RTE Authority to the degree to which the morals of the local community are alleged to be subverted by the programme in question. Therefore, local authorities may already make representations on behalf of the local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three things need to be done.  First, under the Minister's proposal, a local authority may make representations but I believe that the local community would <Col N="1393" /> expect them to be a voice for the people of that area.  My amendment would substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; to ensure that there would be an obligation on local authorities to speak on behalf of the local community.  That would also elevate the representational functions of local authorities above the &ldquo;Bally-magashery&rdquo; approach to a much more serious level.</P>
    <P>Second, public bodies, and in particular Government Ministers, should be required to take the local authorities seriously.  It is my experience that when local authorities send letters to Government Ministers they get an acknowledgement but rarely receive a substantive reply.  Very often when they seek to represent the interests of the local community by seeking a meeting with a Government Minister no reply is received.  I have been a member of two local authorities who have repeatedly asked the Minister who is sitting across the Floor to meet with them to discuss a whole range of matters but he has been very reluctnat to do so.  It is one thing to include a provision in legislation stating that the local authority may represent the interests of the local community but the question is whether the Minister and his colleagues in Government will take those representations seriously.  It is very easy to write letters to Government Ministers but this is a waste of time if they are not noted.</P>
    <P>Third, we need to put a framework in place &mdash; we will deal with this matter later when we come to other amendments &mdash; to involve community organisations, be they community groups or residents' associations, so that the local authority draw together the combined view of local organisations and voluntary bodies and convey it to the appropriate authorities. My amendment would place an obligation on the local authority to carry out this function rather than leave the wording too loose.  If a local authority are upset about a particular television programme they might do this but if the public are concerned about a major development and the authority are not too fussed about it they may tend to ignore the matter. <Col N="1394" /> Therefore, there should be an obligation on them to do so.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the general thrust of Deputy Howlin's amendment which would spell out the purpose of representations and flesh out the provision it is regrettable that we are debating it now.  It would have been far better if we had been given the opportunity to tease it out on Committee Stage because parts of it are a source of concern for me, but I hasten to add that I will not be opposing it.  For example, the phrase &ldquo;it shall aim to secure the maximum economic and general development of its functional area&rdquo; could be exploited.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of phrase which is used every month of the year by Fianna Fáil members of Dublin County Council when they want to pass material contravention motions.  They constantly use the excuse that if one builds many houses in a green belt area or if one locates an industry in an unsuitable location employment will be created.  Such a phrase could be used in a way which is not to the benefit of the local community but rather to the benefit of property speculators and as an excuse to pursue the wrong kind of development. I make that point because parts of the amendment, as it stands, are a source of concern.  As I said, it is a pity we did not have an opportunity to tease it out on Committee Stage when it may have been changed around a bit.  I agree with the thrust of the amendment which is very much in harmony with the amendment tabled in my own name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 in my name is similar to amendment No. 5 except that it uses the word &ldquo;must&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I sometime think that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; has a Victorian or polite ring to it.  It has been used in legislation probably since the beginning of the dawn and its use is one of the many traditions of the House of Commons which we have carried on.  Without labouring the point we might consider changing the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;must&rdquo;, but rather than waste the time of the House I will withdraw amendment No. 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> I would like to address amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Howlin which is more substantive.  Section 5 (1) is very short and states that a local authority may represent the interests of the local community in such manner as they think appropriate.  That is very patronising.  A local authority if they deem fit may do something for the local people.  It might be very good of them to do this.  That kind of patronising language is totally out of place.  The fact of the matter is that the views of the local community should be reflected in everything the local authority do.  The local community should also have an input into all decisions made by the local authority.  I dealt with this matter on Committee Stage when we considered the definition of &ldquo;local community.&rdquo; I wish to repeat that the Green Party are in favour of greater local community involvement not just through the elected representatives but by way of plebiscites or referenda.</P>
    <P>While I would support Deputy Howlin's amendment, like Deputy Gilmore, I also spotted the phrase &ldquo;maximum economic development&rdquo; and the alarm bells began to ring.  While Deputy Gilmore queried the use of the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; with respect he did not get to the core of the matter.  The aim to secure the maximum economic development has landed us in the mess we are in today.  Of course we need development but I suggest that the correct word to use is &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;.  That is the kind of development that we need, sustainable development, not just this year and next year but for decades and centuries to come.  Having made that point, I would be supportive of Deputy Howlin's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I vividly remember the 1985 local election and the slogan of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time was &ldquo;power back to the people&rdquo;.  Having studied this Bill I wonder if they would consider they have achieved their objective.  I believe they have not.  I am very supportive of this amendment but I agree with Deputy Garland's view on the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;; to <Col N="1396" /> me, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; does not carry a whole lot of weight and I think the word &ldquo;must&rdquo; is far more desirable.  The amendment states &ldquo;shall represent the interests of the local community&rdquo; and to my mind, this Bill does not bring power back to the local people.  In my own council, and I am sure it is not different from other councils around the country I have seen that the public representatives who are elected to the council are often suspicious of organisations.  If you need evidence of that all you need to do is to take a deputation from the chamber of commerce into the Chamber and let them speak their minds and you will notice the protectionist mentality of some of our public representatives.  I hope that this Bill would bring back &mdash; and this is the reason the amendment is desirable &mdash; a certain amount of power to the local community and that there would be far more local community involvement in local government,.  Local government will only survive if those objectives are achieved.  I would be supportive of anything that would enhance the status of the local community and ensure that they are involved.  Therefore I certainly support this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is very important that the voice of the local community is heard through the local authority.  In latter years particularly since most of the funding for local authorities comes from central funds, the Department have more or less forgotten the voice of members of local authorities.  We are all aware of how difficult it is at times to get a Minister to meet a deputation on various aspects affecting local authorities.  There is a huge gap in communications between the Government and members of the local authorities, who are in effect trying to represent their local communities as best they can.  I suggest that something should be done on a more definite basis, perhaps officials from Government Departments should attend local authority meetings to obtain firsthand knowledge of what happens in the local authority.  Local government is being isolated from central Government.  I do not think that proper <Col N="1397" /> facilities were set up when funding was taken away from local authorities.</P>

      <P>The Deputy specifically stated that section 5 (1) would not impose any obligation on local authorities and as a result he is unclear as to what is intended.  As I have said, I fundamentally disagree with his interpretation and understanding of section 5 (1).  It is simply an enabling section; it is not designed to force a local authority to do anything whatsoever.  It will be a matter for the elected members to decide how this enabling provision should be implemented, subject only to the terms of the section.  This is how it should be and it is not proper or reasonable to take the decision away from them in this matter.  I am satisfied that they should make that decision themselves.</P>
      <P>What we are doing in section 5 is certainly important.  Some people have taken the view up to now that it is not the business of local authorities to seek to represent the views of the people in the local community to other organisations such as RTE, the ESB or other statutory bodies.  People have said that the local authorities have no right to be making representations on a particular item even though it has a very direct impact on the lives of the community which the representatives serve.  Section 5 makes it clear that local authorities have a general representational role and that they are entitled to bring the local view of a particular problem to the attention of that body, be it statutory or otherwise. Deputy Gilmore stated that and he was right.  I agree with his point of view on that.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the section gives local authority members a status which they did not have up to now.  They may very well have been passing motions and resolutions which they did not have the right to do but they were doing it.  This simply seeks to give them that representational role.  The Deputy wants to put limits on them.  Deputy Gilmore is right and he made some references to the difficulties they would have with Deputy Howlin's wording.  Apart altogether from that why is the Deputy putting a limit on them at all?  It is stated in clear and simple terms in the section what it is proposed to do and the Deputy is still not satisfied.  In spite of that, the Deputy is talking about local democracy but at the same time he wants to put some mandatory grip on them as to what they &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;must&rdquo; do.  Why is the Deputy trying to restrict what I am seeking to achieve in their favour by giving them this new status. That is what section 5 is about but Deputy Howlin has misread it.  I do not accept that we should put a corral around what they might or might not seek to represent. Let us not forget that it is all a question of powers, functions and duties which are the three things we are talking about.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be right to start telling local authorities what their duties are.  I have more respect for local authority representatives and members than to do that.  They know very well what they were elected to do and how they should represent the people who elected them.  Deputy Howlin's amendment would curtail the powers of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of allowing local authorities carry out the new function in such manner as they consider appropriate. <Col N="1400" /> Why does Deputy Howlin want the Minister to tell the local authorities what their duties are?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That would in fact give them the power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If they wish to make representations to the Minister or other bodies they may do so.  However, if they decide for any reason not to make representations why should we, collectively, tell them that it is their duty to do so and if they do not make representations they will be breaking the law?</P>
      <P>If we were to spell out the things local authorities must do, which Deputy Howlin's amendment proposes, we would &mdash; I do not think that Deputy Howlin would wish this to happen &mdash; weaken the overall effect of their status as a representative body.  We are asked in effect, to introduce different categories of representational roles and I do not want to do that.  The top priority of one council might not have any relevance to the priority of another council.  Local councils should be left to decide matters for themselves, which is all this section seeks to do.  It is wise to enable local authorities to do this in the way they feel appropriate.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Allen that we should have good lines of communication with the local communities.  This point is covered by this and later sections. However, we must not allow ourselves to run away with the idea that in some way local authority members are distant or unmindful of the views being expressed in their local communities.  They are very <i>au fait</i> with what is happening in their local communities and they know how to handle representations and deputations dealing with local matters.  We should not make it mandatory on them what they have to do in that regard as this would impinge on their rights to represent.  That would lessen the democratic influence they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen was concerned about environmental impact statements and the assessments which have to be carried out in regard to such matters.  All of us want <Col N="1401" /> local communities to have a clear understanding of what is happening in their local areas.  Local authority members are the people who should decide what should be allowed by way of development in their communities.  This, in effect, is the great source of power local elected members have when they decide on their county development plans.  I have always told local authority members that they should carefully consider every line of their county development plan.  Those plans set down the programmes for the development of areas in a way which is easily recognisable by them.  However, this is their reserve function and they should guard it jealously.  The directions they give in their development plans set the pace, direction and dimension of the developments which will be permitted under their code.  I recognise the importance of councillors in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness Minister, that is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as environmental impact assessments are concerned, of course these assessments are carried out. Local communities are always very much aware well in advance of any major developments taking place in that area. All I want to do is strike the right balance between allowing these developments to go ahead and what has often been referred to as the stalling of development by way of a long and lengthy process.  I have to put it to Deputy Allen that it has come to my notice in recent years that we have lost investment in job opportunities because of an overly long drawn-out process in dealing with some of these matters. No one wants to curtail people's right to have a say and input into such matters but we have to strike the right balance.  This point is covered well by the present arrangements and the new arrangements which I announced during the week and which will be the subject of legislation on planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>In a way it is part of the whole planning process, whether at the primary level or at the appeal stage.  The right balance has to be struck in all these matters so that we achieve the development which is so essential for the creation of jobs.  For this reason, and because I want the widest possible representational role for local authority members to deal with any aspects they wish, I do not wish to curtail them in the way suggested by Deputy Howlin.  I ask Deputy Howlin to reconsider his amendment and, perhaps, withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister is overwrought by developments over the past two days and is not thinking as straight as he should.  I will try to refocus on what is before us rather than what the Minister thinks is before us.  We are talking about a subsection which provides that a local authority may represent the interests of the local community in such manner as they think appropriate. According to the Minister, this is the representational function he will give to local authority members.  He said, in defence of this provision, that they do not have the right to write the letters they have been writing and pass the motions they have been posting and he will give them a statutory entitlement to do that if they want.  That is as far as the Minister wants to go.  He wants to delimit their activities to writing letters and passing motions.  He is not interested in the real issue of giving powers and functions and putting requirements on local authorities by statute.  There is something very jaded and dated about the Minister's attitude to this fundamental concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most modern thought in relation to local government does not talk about the structures of a local authority or the rights of individual members; it talks about the community and the need to serve the people.  That is the principle I am seeking to address in my amendment.  I am not here to fight the interests of local authority members in isolation from their communities.  I want to give real power to communities, to people, so that they feel they can relate to the people who <Col N="1403" /> represent them at local level and that their interests are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>A banal and meaningless subsection like this will not advance that objective one whit, and the Minister knows this. He knows this to such an extent that he would not even define the term &ldquo;local community&rdquo;.  It is hard to imagine a local government Bill which does not define the fundamental term &ldquo;local community&rdquo; it is not considered important enough being passed in this day and age.  The word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; is defined because that is the Minister's power but terms like &ldquo;local community&rdquo; or &ldquo;represent the interests of the local community&rdquo; are left to people's imaginations.  The Minister has put on the record what he means by this; he means that local councillors can write letters to him and they might get answers from the assistant to his secretary.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to establish a fundamental series of principles, one of which relates to consultation.  It seeks to remove the banal one liner the Minister believes is the functional role of councillors and local authorities and replace it with a set of imperatives which would require participation and consultation.  It does not include the words &ldquo;may, if, shall or but&rdquo;; it requires it so that the local community can feel that their views will be taken into account and they can participate to the fullest possible extent on issues which affect them.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I was struck by the comment made by a Deputy from the Dublin area.  He said that for many people the bureaucracy that is Dublin County Council or even Dublin City Council is as removed from them as the bureaucracy which is the national Parliament. They do not feel in the periphery of a large urban authority or a large county authority that they are really affecting decisions.  I want to address that issue which is at the core of the next phase of local democracy not only here but worldwide &mdash; power to the community, power to people.  This is a new concept and because of his timeframe and attitude the Minister may not have <Col N="1404" /> caught up with it yet.  However I am anxious that he would address this issue in a real way.</P>
    <P>As I said, the principles of my amendment are consultation, participation and people power.  I seek to include a requirement, another related modern idea, that services provided to the community are of the highest possible standard.  Has the Minister a difficulty in making that requirement.  My attitude on that is to treat the citizens in the community as consumers, consumers who are paying taxes for a service, a service that is often delivered very badly because of the lack of resources and the starvation of local government particularly over the last four years when this Minister was in office.  I want it to be a mandatory requirement that local authorities serve the community to the best possible standard and that they ensure that the environment is fully protected.</P>
    <P>There is nobody in the House who would argue with any of these issues.  I do not want to flog them to death.  They are fundamental principles &mdash; participation and ensuring that the community is encouraged to participate to the fullest possible extent in all decisions affecting them.  That means spelling out in real terms a set of statutory obligations on local authorities to involve the people, and it goes well beyond the meaningless, one-line provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support from the other Opposition parties for this amendment. I am very mindful of the comments of The Workers' Party representative and the Green Party representative and I am alert to their fears.  For that reason, I would seek, with the permission of the House to substitute the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; so that the amendment would now read:</P>
    <P>shall represent the interests of the local community to the maximum possible extent, shall aim to secure the sustainable economic, social, environmental, recreational, cultural, community, and general development of its functional area...</P>
    <P>and so on.  With the agreement of the <Col N="1405" /> House I would seek to amend my amendment accordingly.</P>
    <P>Question: &ldquo;That the amendment to the amendment be made&rdquo; put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made some peculiar statements in relation to my contribution. They displayed a lack of confidence in local authority members.  The reality is that the Minister is caught in a timeframe.  He is happy with things as they are.  He wants local authority members to attend meetings, express interest, pass the odd resolution and send it up to him.  He does not want them to have real clout.  He does not want the community and the people on the ground to have real influence in the affairs of <Col N="1406" /> their own communities.  I am anxious that we would give real power to people and therefore I wish to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not want to spend too much time on this matter because, with the exception of one or two points, I have argued my case in relation to this section.  What I want to do is to give real power to communities, and that is the purpose of this somewhat standard amendment.  The subsection would then read: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) a local authority shall for the purposes of giving effect to that subsection&rdquo; do what is listed in (a), (b) and (c).  So often we put provisions in legislation like this saying what people may do.  Most of the aspects covered under the section are important enough to put in the legislative imperative.  I have argued this case to exhaustion.  I do not propose to take up much time because we are limited in this debate.  I hope the Minister in this one instance will accept the logic of the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 9, we <Col N="1409" /> believe local authorities should have the flexibility to extend their activities.  We want local authorities to enter into a particular arrangement with voluntary sector community groups with a view to planning and implementing responses to the needs and issues identified in areas and communities of special need.  I refer to examples in my own city where I believe lines of communication have not been as clear as they should be at times, bringing about serious conflict between the community, public representatives and the local authority that could have been avoided.  For example, local authorities, in dealing with problems relating to the travelling people, should be in a position to set up subcommittees consisting of local authority members, local authority officials and representatives of the travelling people so that those people can put their case in a direct fashion to the elected members and officials.  Unfortunately this kind of arrangement is all too rare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that we are not here as members of parties protecting the rights of local authorities.  We are here to protect the rights of the people who vote for us, the 6,000 or 7,000 who vote for me, and I am sure the Minister gets more votes than that.  They are the people whose rights we are protecting. We are not protecting the role of the local authority or the rights of the Minister. People feel they are not given a proper voice in the running of local authorities. The line of communication is faulty.  Our amendment aims to remedy that and enable a proper exchange of views between local groups and elected representatives and officials.  It will allow local authorities to develop their own role.  In this I see local authorities having the power to enter into arrangements with, say, chambers of commerce and local trades councils to deal with the social issues of unemployment and the proper development of certain areas within their jurisdiction.  At the moment some authorities are equipped to do that and they take the initiative but other local authorities do not enter into that role. They confine their activities basically to the maintenance of roads and building of <Col N="1410" /> houses.  They see no role for themselves in the development of their area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I repeat a suggestion I made in the debate on this Bill that the role of local authorities is to equip themselves with information as to how their different policies are going to interface with the public.  My own council have a system of monthly deputations and within that system lies a possibility of extension and involving the public more fully.  At the moment local community groups in County Dublin can apply to come in once a month with five items on an agenda and meet with the officials of the council and their representatives <i>in camera</i>; the media are not there, therefore, very frank discussion can take place.  The problems can be as minute as removing a gate pillar at the end of a road but they are very important to a small local area.  I would like to see the council's role extended to assist those groups to carry on, have their AGMs and so on, and ensure they represent the full range of interests in their area.  All of us as public representatives have received letters and have been asked to make representations on behalf of a community association or residents' association, only to find that that wing of the association was not democratically elected from a region.  It is important that we assist in ensuring that local community groups are properly represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see us adopt what is quite a common practice in some countries where if a major policy is being changed or introduced the local authorities hold what is essentially a public hearing.  They put notices in the local papers to the effect that on such a date in the town hall or in a local hotel anybody interested in the change of policy &mdash; perhaps as Deputy Allen says on the settlement of travellers &mdash; can come along, put his or her views to officials who are there to answer questions and listen to other views expressed.  Maybe then we would not be all the time in confrontation with communities when we are trying to implement policy issues on matters such as our travellers' programme, building <Col N="1411" /> a sewage treatment plant or a tiphead, providing necessities which, sad to say, frequently result in confrontation when councillors from different parties find themselves taking a stand against one another.  We all know in our heart of hearts that to be attuned to the needs of our community we eventually have to take decisions on such matters.  This amendment would allow the Minister and the local authorities the kind of flexibility we on this side of the House would like to see.  I hope the Minister will accept the spirit of this amendment and incorporate it into the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to strongly support the sentiments just expressed.  I happen to be an extremely active councillor on Dublin Corporation.  The Minister will be aware of my activities particularly in trying to assist him in a general way to build relationships with the local communities, for example those in inner city flat complexes who are in receipt of funding for refurbishment.  It is incredible that communications are so difficult between the people on the ground and people in important positions at local government level.  Let me cite the example of an allocation of, say, £5 million of taxpayers' money for the refurbishment of Fatima Mansions.  Consider the Fatima Mansions Development Association and their lack of contact with the Minister's Department or of proper channels into the local authorities, and you can understand the questioning that is going on in that area whether the £5 million is being spent to the best advantage of the community. It is vital in so many areas that we establish proper forums for involving and inviting in organised residents' groups, be they the South Inner City Community Development Association, who are attempting to build community solidarity within a very deprived section of Dublin, or any other group.  What formula exists for the group I have just mentioned, who are doing excellent work, to get EC funding or central Government funding?  They are swimming in a pond because of the missing <Col N="1412" /> linkage of a forum for them to relate the collective problems, plans and projects they would like to see the Government take on board.</P>
      <P>The notion that community groups, in the voluntary sector, should be involved also in the planning of their area is a key and important area.  There are many individual community groups in the south inner city, who are independent of everybody else, attempting to upgrade the quality of their lives and their environment. From the Tenters in the Liberties to Maryland to John Dillon Street and the various groups involved with SICCDA, each doing what they think is expected of them &mdash; to look at their community and to make submissions about how they think their communities can be upgraded.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that groups can make submissions when the local authorities are preparing their development plan, the reality is, because of the lack of structures, that community groups can go to tremendous lengths engaging town planners, architects, engineers and draftsmen and make submissions which, if they had power, or had access to the wheels of power, they would be able to upgrade their own environment.  But there is nobody there to give them assistance. Where are the community planning officers who should be sitting down with organised groups, looking at their proposals and recommending deletions or additions to those proposals, and, seeing that these proposals are taken on board and acted on?  At present, the ritualistic leading of the tenants or the residents into the various honeycombed departments of Dublin Corporation to meet the planners one day, the officials of the roads and traffic section the next day, to meet the housing section and so on; nobody seems to be acting in a cohesive manner in response to the collective needs of communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I firmly believe that SICCDA, Nato or the big organisations like ACRA should be facilitated in a planned and structured way by local authorities in having their <Col N="1413" /> case not just listened to but to be participants in the process of upgrading their environment and their community.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether this is a point of order.  We have decided to debate amendments Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10 together.  While I did assent, I now consider that in the interests of good order we should add amendment No. 11 to that grouping because amendment No. 11 is virtually the same as amendment No. 9.  I would like to point out to Deputies Mitchell and Allen that there appears to be a typographical error in their amendment.  The first line of amendment No. 9 reads: &ldquo;enter into a particular arrangement ...&rdquo; and the first line of amendment No. 11 reads: &ldquo;enter into a partnership arrangement....&rdquo;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I would like to support the whole concept of encouraging co-operation with communities. I have said often in public life that you could not pay people to do work done by voluntary bodies.  Organising a council estate and a Tidy Towns Competition can be encouraged simply because good will exists.  I am lucky to be a member of Carlow County Council where there is such good will.  Often, a grant of £50 from the county council to a voluntary group who are looking after an area can encourage them beyond what would be done on a voluntary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should always encourage liaison between voluntary groups who are doing public work and the county council staff. The Minister will understand if I say that this reminds me of teachers.  Sometimes teachers are very good meeting parents and they look on it as a genuine two-way conversation.  Other times, in the minority of cases, teachers take umbrage that they are being asked about the whole set up and then a bad relationship can develop between parents and teachers.  In a county council it is vital that voluntary <Col N="1414" /> bodies should know they will get every co-operation possible from the council and that it is not a case of them and us. Anything that can be done to improve the administration of public affairs should be encouraged.</P>

      <P>I was rather disappointed that Deputy Howlin was pursuing this matter at this time.  I thought we had disposed of the matter.  However, he seems to be possessed with a determination to be rigid in the whole area of representation.  I regret that because it reflects on the role of the elected member.  I want to give superior recognition to that role.  Deputy Howlin's proposal to substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; would not be appropriate for the purposes of section 5 (2), which is to indicate the sort of actions which a local authority can take pursuant of their representational role.  Deputy Howlin's amendment would make the provision far too rigid and I do not think he wants to do that.  For that reason I hope he will reconsider his position.</P>
      <P>He suggested, in amendment No. 8, the deletion of subsection (2) (a).  This does not make any sense since taken in conjunction with the mandatory nature of his other amendments, it could place an obligation on local authorities to communicate views to other bodies on matters in which those other bodies have no function.  We would not want to get involved in that kind of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell's amendment No. 9 seeks an arrangement with community groups.  My attitude is &mdash; and this is shared by Deputy Browne and Deputy Owen that it should be a matter for individual local authorities to decide how best to involve their community groups.  I was rather pleased to hear Deputy Owen's attitude and the example she gave to how it worked so well in one particular area. The fundamental object of this section is to enable local authorities and to encourage them to get involved in making those decisions, and how best they can incorporate an arrangement by way of information with their local communities.  This <Col N="1415" /> can quite properly be left to the discretion of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Different solutions may be appropriate in different parts of the country depending on the local circumstances.  We had a good example of that from Deputy Owen.  A local circumstance dictated a <i>modus operandi</i> to the local members as to how best they could achieve that.  They have done that and I encourage it.  It may not be proper for me to congratulate Deputy Owen and her colleagues for the way they addressed that matter, because that is fundamental to what is being talked about here.  Deputy Howlin wants to be much more rigid than that.  I would like to see an appropriate arrangement, depending on the circumstances, attached to individual local authorities, wherever they are located.</P>
    <P>The new framework provided for in Part VI in relation to committees will facilitate local authorities in devising appropriate responses to that matter.  I would refer Deputies to Part VI where that is incorporated in a very fundamental way in the whole area of committees. That is the way I want it to be.  I feel we are addressing the matter in a proper way.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will also help as it will give wider powers to assist local groups in activities of one kind or another, and that is good too.  We are <i>ad idem</i> as to what we wish to achieve.  What is in the wider framework I am suggesting &mdash; it is incorporated in Part VI and also in section 6 &mdash; will go a long way to deal with that. Deputy Howlin's suggestion in amendment No. 10 to subsection (2) (b) is an example of another attempt to spell out in the Bill in great detail how local authorities should manage their affairs, but I do not want to do that.  That is the sort of approach that is against the whole thrust of local government reform we are trying to put in place.  We do not want to be rigid.  We do not want to put mandatory demands on local elected members who, as Deputy Byrne quite rightly said, represent the groups to whom he referred.  I am very aware of the Deputy's representational role on behalf of his <Col N="1416" /> community.  I am not singling him out, but he takes that role very seriously and is persistent in it.  That is the way we should proceed, and I say well done.</P>

      <P>That system is recognised in section 5 which refers to the representational role.  The superiority of the elected representative is taken into account because the community selects and elects the representative and they can always approach that representative. I would not like anybody to think that representatives are or would seek to be remote from the people.  Inherent in some of Deputy Howlin's comments is the impression &mdash; I hope I am wrong in this &mdash; that elected representatives seek to distance themselves or be remote in some way from those who elect them.  I know the Deputy does not believe that but he is persisting with a rigidity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not intend to repeat the arguments I made on the last group of amendments about the desirability of leaving as much as possible to the local councillors, but of course the arguments apply with equal force in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the involvement of community groups in the local government system, the expert committee considered that matter in some detail.  They were quite adamant that it should be left to the individual local authority to decide how best that involvement, to which Deputy Owen referred, would evolve.  It is a worthwhile aim and it is fundamental to the whole question of reform that that aim should be pursued.  The committee felt it is the job of the elected members to make the appropriate arrangements locally, and that is good.  Certainly, the arrangements in which one local authority or group of councillors might get <Col N="1417" /> involved might differ greatly from the type of arrangements that would be appropriate in another part of the country.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with local power and local decision-making.  I am not going to take from Deputy Howlin's contribution on power to the people, but this reform has this fundamental element that local people should make local decisions, they should be communicated with and talked to, but the decision should be made by those whom the community have selected and elected to make decisions on their behalf.  That is what we are trying to achieve in this Bill.  The expert committee make that very clear where they state that this will be a matter for the individual local authority and that some structured arrangements to facilitate contact should be devised by each local authority.  That is a wise recommendation and there is good sense in it. With that in mind I ask Deputy Howlin, and the other Deputies concerned, to reconsider the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are taking four amendments together.  I specifically commented on the first two amendments in my name and I want to comment finally on amendment No. 10 because I will not have another opportunity to do so.  I do not understand how the Minister can object to that amendment.  It spells out what the Minister means in a one sentence statement in subsection (2) (b): &ldquo;Without prejudice <Col N="1418" /> to the generality of subsection (1) a local authority may, for the purposes of giving effect to that section, facilitate and promote interest and involvement in local government affairs.&rdquo;  What does the Minister mean by that?  I sought to put flesh on that concept.  This is something that is already happening informally around the country where local authorities are trying to involve local groups, particularly schools and children and other individuals, in the affairs of the local community.</P>
    <P>What I seek to add to the Minister's proposal is: &ldquo;by managing its affairs in such a way as to promote open and accountable local government&rdquo;.  Who could possibly object to that?  I am seeking to add the following: &ldquo;by encouraging the maximum participation in all decisions affecting the local community, and by ensuring the highest possible awareness of all decisions&rdquo;.  Surely the Minister is not adverse to including that phrase.  We should be as detailed and as clear as we can.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about my determination. I take that as a compliment, not an insult&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If there was an openness on the Minister's part to make meaningful amendments to this Bill we would have a better Bill.  I regret that that is not the case and I cannot understand why the Minister objects to this amendment.  How can he object to including the concept that the way to facilitate and promote interest and involvement in local government affairs is in the way I have outlined, by managing affairs in a way to have openness and encourage maximum participation? Surely the Minister cannot have any objection to that.  I am willing not to obstruct the Minister in his determination in this regard, and I do not say that in a flattering sense.  I hope that, if I do not persist with the other two amendments in my name, the Minister might accept amendment No. 10.</P>

      <P>In page 9, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) enter into a partnership arrangement with voluntary sector community groups with a view to planning and implementing responses to needs and issues identified in areas and communities.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is somewhat similar to amendment No. 9 which was discussed previously but there is a significant difference between them.  Amendment No. 9 refers to particular relationships and amendment No. 11 refers to establishing a partnership arrangement between local authorities and voluntary groups with a view to planning and implementing responses to needs and issues identified in areas and communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can readily accept this amendment because it adds an additional dimension to the Bill, which is to provide particularly for the voluntary sector.  We <Col N="1423" /> all know that the voluntary sector, tenants' or residents' associations, sports organisations and cultural groups are involved in helping handicapped people and helping to tackle poverty in local communities.  Religious groups are also involved in addressing the problems associated with poverty at local level. Without these bodies, the fabric of society would crumble because many people, particularly those on a low income, are heavily dependent on voluntary bodies carrying out a whole range of work and committing a lot of their time and money to working for the community.</P>
    <P>At present there is no formal structure whereby voluntary bodies can be involved in the work of local authorities. They can, of course, make a submission to a local authority, meet their officials and have meetings with councillors and other public representatives; they can generally lobby the local authority. However, we need to elevate their position; there needs to be an involvement of this whole sector in the work of local authorities.  There is a precedent for this; for example, in the Planning Act An Taisce are given a role in relation to matters affecting planning.</P>
    <P>In the local government legislation a role should be given to the voluntary organisations which would involve them as partners in the work of local authorities. There are many reasons for doing this, I am thinking of a case in my own constituency in relation to Killiney beach which suffered for many years from fly infestation and pollution although it was used widely by the public.  A number of local people took the initiative by forming the Killiney Beach Awareness Group and they came to an arrangement with Dún Laoghaire Corporation to clean up the beach.  It started very simply where people went to the beach on a Saturday morning with plastic bags supplied by the corporation who undertook to take them away in a truck.  From clearing the rubbish on the beach it developed to proposals from Dún Laoghaire Corporation, which were subsequently funded by State <Col N="1424" /> Departments, for fairly significant improvements to the beach.  It is a very good example of the local authority establishing a partnership with a community group or voluntary organisation to do something which will be for the good of the community.</P>
    <P>That should be more widely encouraged because we must get away from the whole idea of the local authority being purely a provider of services and the wider public being passive consumers of those services.  Because of the cutbacks which have been forced on local authorities I regularly meet people from local communities who ask if there is some way in which they can participate in carrying out certain works in their area.</P>
    <P>These might include works in a park, on an open space in an estate or on a derelict site.  Residents may come forward to ask if there is any way in which they as a community can contribute to the work or provide funds.  Public and voluntary bodies have demanded that they be allowed enter into a partnership with local authorities in carrying out particular works.  Such a provision needs to be built into the Bill to encourage local authorities and their members who may be reluctant to do so, to involve the local community.  I have come across cases where members of a local authority notified the management of their local authority that neither they nor their officials should have a meeting with a community group without members of the local authority being present.  That is high-handed and unnecessary and a practice that needs to be stopped.</P>
    <P>We should encourage the local authorities to involve local community organisations directly in the decision-making process and on committees.  What would be wrong with involving the regular users of a public library in a library committee; the regular users of a leisure centre in the board of management, or the sports clubs who use public parks provided by the local authorities in the committees who manage and run those parks?</P>
    <P>That is the way to involve the local community.  For example, in the area of <Col N="1425" /> housing many complaints have been received from tenants that maintenance work has not been carried out.  One logical way of approaching the matter would be for local authorities to establish management or housing committees which would comprise the tenants, the staff who provide the services, local authority members and the management to ensure that problems are addressed around the table.  That is the way we should proceed in the area of local government.  We should involve both the providers of the service and the consumers in a partnership. The reason I put down the amendment is to ensure that this dimension can be built into the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore very eloquently expressed most of my views on this matter.

I am very pleased that The Workers' Party, who might be seen as being too close to trade union interests and concerned more about the need to create employment in the local authorities for their members, are now accepting our concept of local government which favours the involvement of community groups.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment which I consider to be a very reasonable one.  It is not based on any ideology but on a variety of positive views.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I accept your ruling &mdash; which did not take me by surprise &mdash; but I propose to move a motion under Standing Order 143 (2), &ldquo;That notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders the House shall deal with a motion under Standing Order 102 to recommit the Bill.&rdquo; Paragraph (2) states, &ldquo;provided that in cases of urgent necessity &mdash; and I appreciate that I will have to seek the assistance of the Chair in this matter &mdash; of which the Ceann Comhairle shall be the judge, any Standing Order or Orders may be suspended upon motion made without notice.&rdquo;  I am seeking your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to move a motion under that paragraph because I consider this to be a case of urgent necessity given the amount of time left.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan appreciates that it is a matter for the Chair to decide.  Even if the Chair was disposed to adjudicate on it, by virtue of what appears in Standing Orders in respect of moving motions, the Deputy is prohibited from moving it in Government time.  Since we are now in Government time, the Deputy is not in order in moving the motion.</P>

      <P>The Standing Order is explicit and provides a general authority for Members.  In my view there is nothing in Standing Orders which would prohibit me moving the motion.  The Standing Order I quoted is an enabling provision which allows Standing Orders to be suspended in cases of urgent necessity.  The Fine Gael Deputy has established the reasons we consider this to be a case of urgent necessity at this stage.  Given that we have dealt with so few amendments on both Committee Stage and Report Stage many outstanding issues remain to be dealt with.</P>

Given that the order for Fifth Stage has already been made his request cannot be accommodated.</P>

The guillotine motion agreed on Tuesday sought to frustrate the application of a range of Standing Orders and the orderly conduct of our affairs.

      <P>The guillotine motion agreed by the House on Tuesday of this week encompassed the order for Fifth Stage of the Bill and a number of other issues.  When the guillotine motion was being dealt with on Tuesday of this week encompassing the ordering of Fifth Stage of this Bill and some other issues, it was contended it was outside the scope of Standing Orders because Standing Orders prescribed that Standing Orders could not be suspended for more than one day.  That motion has sought and achieved the objective of nullifying all of the Standing Orders and all the mechanisms that the drafters of Standing Orders put down to protect the Members of this House and the conduct of orderly business.  It has been disastrous in relation to this Bill.  It is proposed to do the same thing again next week.  I am looking to you, Sir, as the arbiter of good order to give a direction as to how we can protect ourselves and do our business properly if our business can be steamrolled through and the entire book of Standing Orders &mdash; the framework in which we operate &mdash; is to be thrown out the door when the Government see fit.</P>

      <P>Deputy Howlin was present and so was I when, following the order of the business for the week, a matter which would have affected that order was discussed and was subsequently accepted and agreed.  The point was made that agreement to the new request would affect the time allocation in respect of what was ordered.  At that stage I do not recollect any change. There was some adjustment made which on one hand would compensate for the new matter that was allowed and which would attempt to compensate for the time lost on this matter.  There was no change in the order that the Chair must carry out.  The Chair must be guided by the order that is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the regret of everybody else that we are dealing with this matter in a totally unsatisfactory way but the point has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 is very important and seeks to have a partnership arrangement with a range of individuals and community groups with a view to planning and implementing the responses to needs and issues identified in areas and in communities. The amendment was tabled in response to a series of requests which we have all got.  It is interesting that the Minister indicated he might see it as more appropriate to section 6.  Amendment No. 19 in my name seeks to bring an amendment to section 6 of the Bill which would more or less have the same impact, but maybe slightly broader than that sought in the amendment in the names of Deputies Gilmore and Garland.  I strongly support this amendment.  It is important that the whole issue of partnership arrangements would be specifically allowed for in legislation.  A very eloquent case has been made on this issue <Col N="1432" /> by Deputy Gilmore and I do not think there is anything further I can add to it.</P>
    <P>There is a number of important amendments coming up on this section that I am very anxious to reach.  Again I wish to indicate my frustration that so few substantial amendments are going to be debated in this House and so little by way of amendment is to be accepted by the Minister, whose rigidity and determination to plough through this Bill in its obviously flawed state is a cause of regret to us all.  I strongly support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy himself said, amendment No. 11 was dealt with previously and he knows that I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Deputies Gilmore and Garland.  This amendment is similar to Deputy Mitchell's amendment No. 9.  This point was also recognised by the Deputies who have spoken. I do not consider that the change proposed in the amendment is warranted. Not only is the question of arrangements with community groups a matter for local decision, but there is very adequate general power under the Bill to make any arrangements which might be necessary. I am thinking here, in particular, of the wide powers under section 6 and the new committee provisions under section 37. These are very generous powers.  I believe that what the Deputy is seeking in his amendment can be catered for under the legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore spoke eloquently in support of voluntary groups and organisations and their role in society.  I did not hear anyone express a contrary view.  The importance of these groups and organisations is not just recognised but is written down in very simple terms in sections 6 and 37.  Generally the thrust of this legislation is not to be rigid.  Speaking of rigidity, I could point the finger at Deputy Howlin who wishes to narrow the concept of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy Gilmore that all of the points he was afraid might not be accommodated in the legislation can be accommodated in the legislation, and the Deputy knows that.  The language <Col N="1433" /> used is simple &mdash; to accommodate the full involvement of voluntary and community groups.  It is a matter for the elected representatives of the local community to determine how best this can be achieved. What more democratic process is there than that?  For this reason I cannot accept the amendment.  The matter has been disposed of previously.  This is just another stalling tactic by the Deputies to accommodate what they sought here a few minutes ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>All the Opposition parties have tabled a large number of substantive amendments to the Bill, and I want to refer to some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled an amendment, which I hoped we would reach, in regard to the establishment of an independent implementation commission, as recommended in the Barrington report, to oversee the implementation of local government reform.  Another amendment deals with what I consider to be a more satisfactory arrangement for the devolution of powers from central Government to local government. We will not reach that amendment. I also put down an amendment in regard to the establishment of an independent local boundary authority who would deal independently with the question of the boundaries of local authorities and the electoral boundaries within them.  I proposed specific amendments in relation to Dublin, for example, the establishment of a greater Dublin council.  Incidentally, I received a letter this morning from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce in which they indicated their wish to see the establishment of a greater Dublin council who would have an overall co-ordinating role in the Dublin area.  It is very regrettable that we do not have enough time to deal with those amendments.  It was insulting of the Minister to suggest that there is <Col N="1434" /> some kind of stalling tactic being pursued by Members on this side of the House. As we did not have a decent period of time between the conclusion of the Second Stage debate and the commencement of Committee Stage, many of us had to spend the weekend working on these amendments, not having available to us the back-up available to the Minister.  With all of the back-up available to him, it took the Minister four months, from the time the report was published, to produce a Bill.  We had only three or four days from the conclusion of Second Stage to the commencement of Committee Stage to produce amendments to this Bill and from 11.20 p.m. last night until 10.30 a.m. this morning to produce amendments for Report Stage. I think we did remarkably well in the circumstances to produce substantive amendments for this Bill.  We did not do this to idle away the hours on Sunday afternoon.  We put down these amendments so that we could have a serious debate on the Bill.  It is precisely because of the Government's insistence that this Bill should be guillotined and forced through the House without serious debate that we will not reach these amendments.  The guillotine decision has contributed to the fact that Members who would be prepared to speak on one amendment and section at a time have had a tendency to refer to later sections, because we knew those sections would never be debated.</P>
    <P>It is most insulting of the Minister at this late stage in the debate to make a throw-away remark which suggests that the Opposition Members in this House are not taking the issue seriously.  I accept that the substance of the amendment before us now has been debated in the context of amendment No. 9 and, therefore, I do not intend to spend any more time on it other than to ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) conduct referenda on issues of local interest, including referenda sought by petition of a reasonable number of persons normally resident in the functional area of the local authority, and including referenda on proposals to raise funds through local contributions for specific purposes (the purpose, the amount of money to be raised and spent, and the method of <Col N="1436" /> collection to be specific on all voting papers).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a novel amendment.  It is one of the many constructive, positive and innovative suggestions to have come from this side of the House.  I wish we had time to debate all of our amendments but unfortunately this is frustrated by the guillotine motion imposed by the Minister's party.  How dare the Minister insult us and the work we have done very late into the night so that we could try to keep to the impossible timetable which the Government have forced on us.  This is certainly not in the interests of good legislation.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to put a new concept into being, that is conducting a referendum on issues of local interest. This issue deserves considerable discussion. I hope the Minister will not be dismissive of it but will give it reasonable consideration.  Occasionally local authority members need to have the positive affirmation or consent of their local area to do things, to prove that there is a consensus or majority out there who want specific things done.  This is the first time this concept has been proposed in legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>This amendment is related to amendment No. 16 in my name.  We spoke at length last night about the discredited method of raising funds by way of charges which are seen by many people to be a divisive form of double taxation.  In order to restore confidence in any method of local funding there needs to be a facility to have the voice of the people heard on the specific proposal.  The concept would not apply exclusively to the proposals on fund raising &mdash; although one could have a referendum on anything that people sought in the area &mdash; but would also deal with a proposal to raise funds for a particular purpose.  I am not talking about any basic function or legislative requirement that is devolved on a local authority. I am talking about the question of a local authority wanting to put a facility in place, say, a swimming pool or a particular type of adventure playground that the children in a particular area might <Col N="1437" /> want and for which a local contribution would be required.  If the local council thought it would be useful to raise moneys to which they do not have access otherwise and put forward a scheme to fund it that would link in to Government grants or EC Structural Funds, they would have the authority to test the will of the people to pay a contribution towards providing that facility and if a majority agreed then it could be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions No. 1, and Questions Nos. 6 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The improvement in search and rescue helicopter coverage made by this Government in less than two years is of particular pleasure to me.</P>
      <P>Up to September 1989, search and rescue helicopters were deployed only at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  In that month, on foot of the interim report of the Review Group on Air/Sea Rescue Services, the Air Corps placed a Dauphin helicopter on permanent 24 hour standby for search and rescue at Shannon Airport. At the same time, and in addition to the Dauphin helicopters, they reintroduced the Alouette III helicopter for daylight search and rescue at Casement Aerodrome.  The success of those deployments can be gauged by the statistics of rescues performed by the Air Corps since September 1989.</P>
      <P>In that time the Shannon helicopter has answered 140 search and rescue calls and saved 74 lives.  Fifty-four air ambulance missions were also carried out from Shannon.  The operation at Casement has answered 65 search and rescue calls and saved 28 lives.  Forty-four night operations have been carried out by the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the final report of the Review Group on Air/Sea Rescue Services the Government approved a deployment of search and rescue helicopters as follows: a medium-range contract helicopter service to be located at Shannon with an operating radius of 200 <Col N="1439" /> nautical miles; the relocation of the Dauphin helicopter service currently provided by the Air Corps at Shannon to Finner, County Donegal, on a 24 hour response basis throughout the year, once the contract helicopter service has been put in place at Shannon; and the deployment of a second Dauphin helicopter at Cork, as soon as practicable, primarily for operation with <i>LE Eithne</i> but to be located at Cork when not embarked on the ship.</P>
    <P>At the end of February 1991, I announced that the Government had approved the acceptance of a tender from Irish Helicopters Ltd. for operating the medium range service.  The contractor plans to place a Sikorsky S61N helicopter, equipped with search and rescue equipment, winch, marine communications and floodlighting at Shannon in July 1991.  There will be a short overlap period during which the Air Corps Dauphin will remain on standby at Shannon while the contractor's staff familiarise themselves with procedures and with the location.  The contractor and the Air Corps have already met to plan the changeover in a co-operative and co-ordinated way.  The preparation and training of personnel involved in the medium-range helicopter search and rescue service is a matter for the contractor.  The contract specification requires that all captains and winch operators/winchmen in the service have previous experience in that role in a search and rescue unit. The contractor informs me that his staff in the search and rescue service are all previously experienced search and rescue personnel and meet the training and experience requirements laid down by my Department.  Apart from the need to familiarise themselves with procedures and the location referred to above, no additional training is required.</P>
    <P>The contractor has agreed to make a Sikorsky S61N available to Air Corps personnel, if required, for training-type conversion purposes.</P>
    <P>The contract documentation is being finalised by the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the solicitors representing the <Col N="1440" /> contractor.  The finalisation of documentation is proceeding on the legal language of the contract already agreed.  I hope to be in a position to sign the contract in the next few weeks.  Planning for the introduction of the service is not affected and arrangements are in train for a July start-up date.</P>
    <P>The role of the Air Corps in search and rescue will be enhanced under the new deployment.  Air Corps helicopters will be deployed at three locations: Baldonnel, Finner and at Cork when not embarked on the <i>LE Eithne.</i>  Moreover, in keeping with another recommendation of the Review Group on Air/Sea Rescue Services, full use will be made of Air Corps fixed-wing aircraft to locate targets so as to shorten search time and maximise the range and endurance of helicopters.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Air Corps, the Navy and the Department of Defence on their achievements in this area and record my appreciation of the enthusiasm with which the Air Corps and the Department of Defence have made arrangements for their new responsibilities in the area of search and rescue.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister hopes to have this service in operation by July and I welcome his announcement.  I would like also to take the opportunity of complimenting the Air Corps on the recent work they did in the Clare area when the French fishing vessel was grounded there.  I want to compliment the team based in Ballyvaughan on the very effective manner in which they managed to get that boat safely to Cork without causing any damage to the environment in the Galway Bay area.</P>
      <P>A number of recommendations were made in the report of the Review Group on Air/Sea Rescue and Search Services. There were nine interim recommendations and over 54 final recommendations. Could the Minister tell the House how many of these are in place right now and when he expects the remainder to be in place?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if he has discussed the recent ramming incidents of Irish trawlers by Spanish vessels off the south-west coast with his Spanish counterpart in the EC; if so, if he will outline the response he received; and the action he proposes to take to safeguard the lives and interests of Irish fishermen and women.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that I have discussed alleged ramming incidents involving Irish and Spanish fishing vessels in the waters off the south-west coast with my Spanish counterpart.  I have also written to my French and Spanish ministerial colleagues expressing my concern at the danger presented to life and property by such incidents.  The response of the Spanish authorities to the concerns voiced by me was that they were anxious to help in the matter and would not hesitate to take action against Spanish nationals in situations where it could be shown that they had been culpable.  I have also raised this topic at the most recent EC Fisheries Council meeting on 18 April 1991 as is my practice at all such meetings with my EC colleagues.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;rules of the road&rdquo; for ships moving in our territorial waters are contained in the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, which are enshrined in domestic legislation.  The Irish regulations do not, however, apply to foreign registered vessels where the incident occurs outside territorial waters. The incidents referred to by the Deputy occurred outside territorial waters.  In the circumstances the only option open to me is to report to the maritime authority of the flag state concerned and to ask them to pursue the matter and this I have done.</P>
      <P>At present in cases of collisions involving an Irish and a foreign vessel outside territorial waters the appropriate form of redress is by way of a civil action and I understand that this avenue is being pursued in the case of some recent incidents.</P>
      <P>Naturally I am anxious that the law be strengthened in this area and have asked the Attorney General to study this complex area of maritime law to see if any means can be found of overcoming the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's assurance that he is looking at <Col N="1443" /> the legislation, but I must put it to him that this is not a matter of &ldquo;rules of the road&rdquo; at sea; this is nothing short of attempted murder.  The facts as given to us are that at sea Spanish trawlers attempted to ram and kill Irish fishermen fishing in EC waters.  It is ridiculous.  I ask the Minister to address this problem. Our Naval Service are prevented from going to their aid due to regulations.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say he has written or spoken to his counterpart. I ask the Minister to consider that the Spanish Ambassador be brought in and told in no uncertain terms that we will not accept this type of activity in EC waters.</P>

      <P>In the most recent incidents we had the help of the Naval Service and I have reports from our naval personnel.  As experienced people in the House will know, sometimes what appears in the papers and what is said is not in accordance with the facts of the reports I get from our naval officers.  I want to emphasise to the House that there is no soft attitude, no pussyfooting about interference with our fishing boats and our fishermen.  This is being pushed strongly by me at the Council of Ministers and at home in so far as I feel a strengthening of the law of the sea is needed with regard to incidents that happen outside our limits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change as regards the operation of the shipping investment grants scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should note that as a result of the measures taken by this Government over the past four years, the Irish fleet has grown from less than 143,000 to 190,300 deadweight tons.  This represents an increase in fleet capacity of more than a third.  Over the same period the number of vessels under the Irish flag increased by more than 20 per cent from 68 to 82. It is estimated that over this period total investment in shipping capacity arising directly from State incentives amounted to more than £28 million.  The Deputy should also note that under the Shipping Investment Grants Act, vessels of up to seven years old may be grant aided.  The Deputy may also be aware of the fact that Community support is being sought towards reducing the additional transport costs which result from our peripherality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the money provided for under this grants scheme has been cut by almost two thirds from last year from £1.34 million to £0.5 million?  Is he aware that this combined with the abolition of the business expansion scheme for the shipping sector flies in the face of the promises made by his <Col N="1445" /> party in the election of 1987 to develop this sector?  Is he further aware this is a time of rising prices for ships and that we have an ageing fleet?  In view of those circumstances and the hypocrisy of our position in applying for EC grant aid for ships and reducing the grant aid available here, will he make sure adequate resources will be made available this year for a proper shipping grant scheme?</P>

      <P>The freeport of Ringaskiddy, County Cork, was established with a view to encouraging economic activity and employment in the Cork area.  There are currently four companies and one subsidiary company operating in the freeport area, while 1989-90 saw 65 companies on site visits to Ringaskiddy.</P>
      <P>The area is being vigorously marketed by Cork Harbour Commissioners and the Industrial Development Authority.  Individual companies in the freeport benefit from deferred liability for customs duties and VAT, as well as simplified customs documentation and procedures.

Is he further aware that they cannot compete with the other freeport areas &mdash; Dublin and Shannon &mdash; because of the failure of the Minister to give them the 10 per cent corporation tax concession? It is a freeport in name only and one of the best kept secrets in Europe because people do not seem to be aware of its existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As was indicated by the Government in their National Development Plan, the ports referred to are regarded as key ports in the overall context of this country's external trade.  To this end projects from each of the ports have been submitted for funding under the Operational Programme on Peripherality. These projects are designed <Col N="1453" /> to ensure that particular shortcomings in relation to capacity are overcome and that projected growth in traffic, whether Lo-Lo, Ro-Ro, bulk or passenger, can be accommodated.</P>
      <P>In relation to the further development of these ports, I should mention that this function is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the relevant harbour authority.  My Department, who have responsibility for the ports of Dublin and Waterford, and the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, who have responsibility for the port of Rosslare, will, of course, seek to facilitate these ports in the implementation of their development plans, given the important role these ports play in Ireland's seaport trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the weighting which the Operational Programme on Peripherality gives to the development of port facilities, given that the overwhelming proportion of funds under that programme is going to road construction within the country rather than to strengthening transport links between this country and Britain or this country and the rest of Europe?  Is the Minister satisfied with the relatively small amount of money being allocated under that programme for the development of ports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Minister who applies for Structural Funds would be very foolish to admit that he is satisfied with whatever he gets.  It is a matter of negotiating all the time.  We have succeeded in impressing <Col N="1454" /> on the Council and the Commission the importance of ports to our peripheral situation.  The experts have assessed the disadvantage in costs at as high as 11 per cent that we are at, being on the periphery, compared with people in the centre of Europe.  Consequently it was easier to make our argument and we have done so.  I am confident that Europe will accept the argument and that up to the end of the century, past the first period, we will be substantially aided in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not doing any prioritisation. It is up to the port authorities to sell and develop their business.  The Deputy already mentioned Larne.  Matters other than costs must be taken into account when comparing a place like Dublin with Larne.  There was considerable industrial trouble in Dublin which affected the operations of the port. Hopefully that has ended now and from that point of view there should be no disadvantage in Dublin as regards development.  As the Deputy knows and as my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications announced, £11 million is scheduled for expenditure at Rosslare Harbour to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <Quest>the number of Spanish fishing boats which have been prosecuted for illegal fishing within our 200 mile exclusive fishing zone since Spain joined the EC; whether any of these Spanish boats have been apprehended on two or more occasions; if he will introduce legislation to allow for the confiscation of foreign fishing boats which repeatedly engage in illegal fishing within our 200 mile fishery limit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of Spanish fishing boats which have been prosecuted for illegal fishing within the Irish management zone since Spain joined the Community is 146.  Of these 74 have been arrested once only and 72 on two occasions or more.  The level of fines applicable under Irish legislation for fishing offences is already among the most stringent in the Community.  They include confiscation of catch and gear, fines up to £100,000 and, on a second indictable offence, and at the discretion of the court, the confiscation of the boat.</P>
      <P>Legislation which would be specifically limited to Spanish or other foreign vessels would be contrary to Community law which excludes discrimination on grounds of nationality.  Any law introduced which would make confiscation obligatory on the court would thus have to apply to all vessels, including Irish vessels. The automatic forfeiture of a boat on a second offence would, I believe, be regarded as a draconian measure by fishermen generally.  It is best in my view to leave such decisions to the discretion of the court.  I will, however, keep the issue of the appropriate scale of penalties under review in the light of developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, from the figures he has given, that the Spaniards are involved in wholesale organised law breaking where fishing off our coasts is concerned?  Is it not obvious that this is organised crime?  From the figures the Minister has given, 72 of these boats have been apprehended on two or more occasions.  Is it not true that the law provides for the confiscation of boats which have been caught fishing illegally twice or more often?  Why is that not <Col N="1456" /> being done?  The whole episode has gone beyond a joke, and I would ask the Minister and the Government to take action. Would the Minister also consult with the Minister for Justice to ensure that the penalties that are applicable are imposed?  Why lay down penalties such as confiscation if they are not imposed? They have never been imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked if I would introduce legislation to allow for the confiscation of foreign fishing boats. I indicated in the course of my reply that the legislation was already there.  I agree with the Deputy that there are serious repeated violations of the law.  The Deputy will understand that in this country the discretion is with the judges and that there is nobody more sensitive than a judge to external interference in their judgments.  They have the power to confiscate a boat for a second offence.  I do not know, because I do not have any statistics on it, whether they have done so or how many times they have done so. Certainly it is not a defect in the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider making it mandatory to have a boat confiscated on a second conviction?  It is obvious that these boats which are owned by companies, not by individuals, are breaking the law on a systematic basis and that the fines are being paid by companies and not by individuals.  It is organised crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

Would the Minister <Col N="1457" /> not agree that this is piracy on the seas, which is very lucrative for the Spaniards who keep returning because the fines are not an adequate deterrent?

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>

      <P>The Review Group on Air/Sea Rescue Services looked at the issue of EC involvement in search and rescue. They concluded that, given the essentially international nature of search and rescue, the European Community ought to play a more active role in co-ordinating the level and distribution of resources deployed by member states for search and rescue.  They noted that while there are EC funds available for fishery protection, none is available for search and rescue purposes.</P>
      <P>I announced on 19 November 1990 that Ireland had secured EC approval of the first phase of a £34 million investment programme for its fishery protection service. The first tranche of £4.4 million has enabled the Department of Defence to order fixed-wing fishery patrol aircraft which would have a secondary role in search and rescue.  As I mentioned in reply to a previous question, the Air Corps intend to make greater use of fixed-wing aircraft to locate targets so as to shorten search time and maximise the range and endurance of helicopters.</P>
      <P>I informed this House last year that Mr. Carlo Ripa de Meana told the European Parliament that he would support the formation of a specialised fleet for sea rescue.  Since his statement, however, the Commission has not tabled detailed proposals in the matter.  My officials will continue to press the European Commission about this.</P>

In view of the fact that the EC is very emphatic in laying down rules, regulations and guidelines in relation to quotas and that we are rightly reminded from time to time that this is a collective resource, will the Minister agree that there should be a far greater input by way of finance to enable us to put an effective fishery protection and rescue service in place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for the safety of life at sea and for the development of the fishing industry, I have publicly expressed my concern at the tragic incident involving a Scottish fishing vessel, the <i>Antares</i> in the Firth of Clyde on 22 November 1990, in which four fishermen lost their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following investigations into the incident, a number of practical measures are now being taken by the British authorities to reduce the risk of such an accident occurring in the future.  These include providing fishermen with advance information on planned movements by dived submarines in the Firth of Clyde area which is broadcast by the UK Coastguard every six hours on VHF radio and so is available to all seafarers using a VHF receiver.  Trials are also under way on the feasibility of providing electronic devices &mdash; or bleepers &mdash; to be attached to a <Col N="1462" /> trawler's nets, which would alert a submerged submarine to the presence of the trawler's fishing gear.</P>
    <P>At my request, the Department of Foreign Affairs are seeking additional information about these measures from the British authorities, including whether they could be applied more generally in the Irish Sea.  At my instruction, the secretary of my Department has been in contact with the fisheries administrations of powers believed to have submarines in the area and my Department are maintaining contact with the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to reinforce our expression of concern and to advance the case for greater safety of life and property of fishermen.</P>
    <P>The Government are very seriously concerned about the dangers that submarines pose to shipping.  We avail of every opportunity to raise this topic in international fora such as the United Nations and the International Maritime Organisation.  This matter is again being raised by Ireland at the 59th session of the IMO's Maritime Safety Committee now being held in London.  At this meeting my Department's chief surveyor will put the maritime safety committee on notice that Ireland will prepare a paper on this topic for the next general assembly meeting of the IMO with the aim of focusing the attention of the international maritime community on this issue and on the need for constant vigilance in this area if a major tragedy is to be avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will he agree that the measures now being taken by the British authorities, particularly by the Ministry of Defence, acknowledge that submarines in the Irish Sea pose a threat to fishing and other vessels?  Will he also agree that the proposed measures will not eliminate the possibility of tragedies occurring, since they are dependent on the fishermen picking up the message which is broadcast or on the bleeper system working? Will he further agree that the time has come for an international treaty to be negotiated between this State and Britain which would require submarines using <Col N="1463" /> the Irish Sea to travel on the surface? Since, quite clearly, we are not in a state of hostility with Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The House and I agree that submarines in the Irish Sea are a problem.  I should remind the House that submarines belonging to the United Kingdom are not the only submarines plying in those waters.  I said in my original reply that I instructed my departmental secretary to contact countries; he contacted the United Kingdom, France, the United States and the USSR, all of which had an interest in that area either through watching one another or going about their business.  Use of VHF is very important and availed of because to my knowledge, there is a special listening officer on board tuned to it.</P>
      <P>I have partly covered arrangements with the UK; it would have to be on a wider basis and my departmental officer, who is in London at the moment, is putting it on that basis.  In the meantime, if VHF and the bleeper systems were in operation, they would be helpful in this regard.  I agree that it is a serious problem and I remember, when I was Minister for Transport in 1982, that one of our boats was sunk by a submarine belonging to the UK.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of serious concern to many people that this has gone on for so long.  I take the Minister's point in relation to meeting his British counterpart but our fishermen &mdash; as well as Scottish fishermen &mdash; are in danger.  Submarine underwater activity in the Irish Sea is unnecessary and agreement could be reached between both nations that it should be curtailed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider convening a committee of the Cabinet comprising himself, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  The three Ministers could then meet their counterparts in England and France, who are also members of the EC, to resolve the matter.  As the UK and France are members of NATO, perhaps they could negotiate with the United States as well as Ireland to have this matter finally resolved.  Are the Government aware of the type of activity these submarines are undertaking in the Irish Sea and is there really a necessity for their movement in that sea?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Has an assessment been made of the possible danger to passenger vessels and shipping generally in the Irish Sea having regard to the fact that the submarines about which we have been talking are, for the most part, nuclear powered?  Has any assessment been made of the possible dangers that could pose to the transportation of people and goods across the Irish Sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The hazard to passenger vessels is in the same category as the hazard to fishermen.  While the Irish Sea is used by submarines it is not as crowded as the approach to the Firth of Clyde.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 15 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>I established the Interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board in January 1990 to assist in all aspects of harbour management and development until such time as the harbour authority are established on a statutory basis.  I took this immediate action in response to calls for the establishment of such an authority.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the work undertaken by my Department since taking over responsibility for the harbour has contributed to the ongoing improvement of the facilities there and the efforts of the harbour management are to be commended.</P>
      <P>The interim board have prepared a draft development plan for the harbour the details of which are on public exhibition at present.  I would like to congratulate the board for their work in preparing such a comprehensive plan for the development of all aspects of the harbour.  All interested parties are invited to express their views on the content of the draft plan.  These views will be taken into account before the board make final recommendations on the nature of development to be undertaken at the harbour.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the board's final recommendations I will consider more permanent arrangements for the operation and development of the harbour, including the question of appropriate legislative changes.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that there has been an extraordinary delay in establishing a proper Dún Laoghaire harbour authority?  We were given a promise in the House almost two years ago that a statutory harbour authority would be established.  What we have got instead is an interim board. While I accept that a draft development plan has been drawn up and interested parties will have an opportunity to make their views known why is it that both the Minister and his Department are so anxious to retain control of the harbour and why are they so slow in coming to the House with legislation to establish a harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither I nor my Department are anxious to retain control.  Our pure and only purpose is to see to it that the harbour in Dún Laoghaire is properly developed.  The interim board consist of a wide range of people with varied expertise. They did a magnificent job &mdash; I could not praise them enough &mdash; in drawing up a plan which the Deputy may see on display in Dún Laoghaire, if she goes to Deputy Gilmore's constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Deputy would welcome her.  The interim board have now presented their report with their plan.  There are differing views on whether an ordinary harbour board or a developmental board, who would have more powers than the traditional stereotyped harbour board, might be more suitable for Dún Laoghaire.  As the Deputy is aware, the chief source of income at Dún Laoghaire is the Sealink ferry and it is envisaged, with the maximum participation of the citizenry, that Sealink will remain there, as a source of funding, and that the amenities of the harbour will be fully developed around it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that the final decision as to what should happen at Dún Laoghaire will be taken by him rather than by the interim harbour board?  Second, can he give us <Col N="1467" /> any indication as to when decisions will be made in the light of the fact that the report has now been presented by the interim harbour board?  Third, since he mentioned the question of the car ferry and since one of the principal proposals in the report relates to improvements to the car ferry terminal, can the Minister give us any indication of the funding arrangements he has in mind?  For example, does he intend to adjust the existing Structural Funds available or seek additional funds to allow the project proceed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the decision will be taken by me and my Department. It would be a very futile exercise to set up an interim harbour board with the degree of expertise that they have and not pay careful attention to their recommendations. With regard to the development funds, CIE and Stena Sealink have expressed an interest in investing there. Third, while the first phase of the programme for peripheral development will not cover Dún Laoghaire harbour it is my intention that an application will be made for funds for the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour in the second phase.</P>

Has the Minister considered establishing a Dublin Bay authority to allow freight services to be developed at Dublin port and Dún Laoghaire to become the premier passenger port?</P>

      <P>In the meantime, the Department of the Marine have already identified a number of locations around the coast where valuable property and amenities are threatened by erosion and proposals to undertake protection works in these areas are being advanced at present.  The Department have no immediate plans for protection work in the Cromane and Killorglin areas of County Kerry.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that there be a local contribution towards the cost of coast protection works.  I am considering, in consultation with my colleague the Minister for Finance, the question of the percentage contribution to be available from the State towards the cost of major protection schemes.</P>
      <P>I reject totally any suggestion of discrimination in the assistance of coastal protection schemes, by my Department, now or in the past.  It is clear that assistance to coastal protection schemes has been administered taking account of the policy of successive Governments in relation to disadvantaged areas, the urgency and priority of particular schemes, and the availability of resources.</P>

      <P>I would have to say on behalf of the agricultural people living in the Cromane and Killorglin areas that this is a most disappointing reply.  In the first instance, extensive areas of land are <Col N="1470" /> threatened by erosion and, second, because it is low lying land there is a constant threat of flooding.  I would strongly urge the Minister to resort to measures to protect these areas as formerly the Land Commission or the Office of Public Works kept and maintained embankments that have now been washed away.  Let me say that it would be entirely inappropriate for the county council to undertake the cost of this work and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that resources are made available through the Structural Fund or other EC funds in order to ensure that the people in those areas can continue their traditional way of life, otherwise they will join the exodus from the land and emigrate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the proposals to amend Council Regulation 3094/86, which are currently on the table.  There are two such proposals: the first &mdash; the Tenth amendment to Regulation 3094/86 &mdash; incorporates a package of amendments concerning net geometry, mesh size and mesh geometry and protection of whiting; the second &mdash; the Eleventh amendment to Regulation 3094/86 &mdash; concerns chiefly the limiting of the conditions under which driftnets may be used.</P>
      <P>The Tenth amendment has been on the table now for some time.  It has been discussed on a number of occasions at Council of Fisheries Ministers level.  At these meetings, I have stated quite clearly that I believe early adoption of effective conservation measures is essential to the preservation of the stocks, particularly of stocks in the North Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an academic matter.  It is a practical matter of maintaining a sustainable livelihood for thousands of fishermen. In the negotiations I have, however, cautioned the Commission against extending to areas outside of the <Col N="1472" /> North Sea the solution to a problem which is essentially a North Sea problem. In addition, I have indicated that I would be very concerned that no decisions be taken in this matter without sufficient evidence having been obtained to corroborate the decisions.</P>
    <P>The Eleventh amendment is a more recent proposal.  The proposal is for a ban on driftnets greater than 2.6 km, with the added stipulation that any driftnets greater than 1 km must remain attached to the vessel during fishing.</P>
    <P>My view at the Council has been that we should not apply the solution to what is essentially a largescale, high-seas problem, on a global basis, the more so in the light of the almost complete lack of scientific evidence on the use and effects of driftnets within Community waters. In addition, I have argued that we should ensure that any proposals adopted take account of the circumstances of the use of driftnets in different sea areas.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I have opposed the introduction of a ban on all driftnets of length greater than 2.5 km.  I have, however, indicated that I could support the introduction of a limit on the maximum permitted length of driftnet provided the limit is set at a level which does not undermine established fisheries or the possibility of their development, unless it is sufficiently clear that the environment is at a significant risk.</P>
    <P>At all stages of the negotiations, the fishing industry here has been consulted in regard to the proposals, and the views expressed have been taken into account in formulating Ireland's response to the proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that by implementing these restrictions, the earnings of Irish fishermen could suffer dramatically?  Would he further agree that Irish fishermen understand the need for conservation but that the Irish waters have been raped by other countries and the Irish fisherman should not have to suffer in this instance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister presented a very strong case on behalf of the Irish fishermen to his counterparts in Europe in the light of our being an island country on the periphery, of our fishing waters having been raped by other member states over the years and from the Irish viewpoint that there is a need to increase the catch of the traditional species, especially mackerel and herring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If we had reached the question the Deputy had tabled on this matter, she would have got some useful and consoling information about the increase in the mackerel quota which I succeeded in getting at the Council meeting in December 1990.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the Celtic Sea herring fishery was so badly hammered by our own fishermen as well as by others that at one stage it was closed down for six years in order to allow the stocks to be replenished.  Happily that has happened and the fishermen have quotas in the Celtic Sea but let me say that the question of the conservation of cod and halibut in the North Sea is very serious.  There is a grave danger of the stocks dying out completely.  The point I made in my reply is that what would remedy the dreadful effects of over fishing in the North Sea is not necessarily applicable in areas 6A and 6B, where similar fish are caught here.  I have been arguing that case at Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree in respect of the use of driftnets for sea trout and salmon &mdash; and in view of the serious depletion of stocks and the serious effect of that on the tourist trade &mdash; that he should take steps to buy out the nets and compensate the fishermen, thus allowing the fish up the rivers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the laws are strictly adhered to and applied we will see to it that enough salmon get up the rivers. With regard to the driftnets the big excitement and concern derived from the use of miles and miles of net in the Pacific <Col N="1474" /> Ocean which had a serious effect on marine life in those areas.  Again it is important not to transfer a remedy from one area to another where it does not suit.</P>

      <P>This is just one of the innovative amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies in relation to the administration of local affairs and the involvement of every member of the local community in the decisions which affect their daily lives.  My amendment proposes the inclusion of subsection (d) in section 5 which would enable local authorities to conduct referenda on issues of local interest including referenda sought by petition of a reasonable number of persons.  As I said this amendment is directly connected to my amendment No. 16 which would empower local authorities, if they so wished, to fund a specific project outside their statutory responsibilities. I am not talking about a project such as house maintenance, roads, and so on which people would expect to be funded from the normal mechanisms.  I am talking about a specific project which might be regarded as an extra, for example, a tourist attraction, an adventure playground, a swimming pool or some facility the community did not <Col N="1516" /> have.  There may well be ancillary or support funding available for such a project either by way of grants from the Minister's Department or EC Structural Funds but there might be a shortfall and local funds may be required.  This amendment seeks to have the consent of the local community to raise such a charge.</P>
      <P>We approached this issue from this perspective because of the discredited nature of the existing service charges which lack public support.  One cannot have any measure of taxation which does not enjoy popular support among those who are levied by it.  It is important that we put some mechanism in place which would give a positive affirmation to the levying of such a charge.</P>
      <P>I would welcome the views of Members on the right of a local authority to consult the electorate on issues.  During the term of office of any local authority contentious issues will arise which will be debated in the community.  Several democracies engage in the consultative process of referendum and nationally we do this on occasion.  I am not suggesting that this mechanism is any substitute for the representative role of local authorities &mdash; it is not and does not mean to be &mdash; but it would be a mechanism whereby local authorities, if they saw fit, could request or require the views of people on a particular issue.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept my amendment, first, because of the necessity to involve everyone in the decision-making process and make this facility available to elected members and, secondly, to enable popular support for a particular funding proposal to be ascertained.</P>

I can envisage a number of situations where that would be of considerable advantage, particularly where requests from local communities for particular works may give rise to a certain amount of controversy.  I am thinking in particular of a petition I got three or four weeks ago concerning the closure of a laneway where even some of the people who signed the initial petition had changed their minds as to whether it <Col N="1518" /> should be closed.  Where there are conflicting views in a local community about works of a particular kind being carried out, a referendum would be a very good way of resolving that kind of issue.</P>
    <P>As with a number of other amendments which are being considered on Report Stage, it is a pity we did not have the opportunity of teasing it out on Committee Stage.  This is where the collapse of the Committee Stage is such a pity because there are a number of areas relating to this amendment that we need to think through a little further.</P>
    <P>First, there are areas of the functions of local authorities which could well be frustrated by the exercise of a referendum, and there are minorities in communities who could well be disadvantaged by the use of a referendum. Take the case of the travellers. In many communities, if there was a referendum about a travellers' halting site, I suspect that the difficulties local authorities already have locating travellers' halting sites might well be compounded. Take also the example of the construction of local authority houses.  There are many areas where there would be considerable opposition to the construction of local authority houses, and I have seen where opposition has arisen to the purchase of land for the building of local authority houses, and where, if a matter of that kind was referred to a referendum, it might well give rise to certain difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the relative power held by people with varying degrees of wealth.  In my involvement in politics one of the things that struck me is the disparity that exists between different communities' capacity to represent themselves.  There are some communities with relatively well off people who have a lot of managerial and organisational skills, and who have the resources that go with that and are much better able to get their act together and put their case &mdash; in this case, to petition for a referendum and perhaps win the referendum &mdash; than poorer communities where the degree of community organisation is not as strong.</P>
    <P>Had we had an opportunity of teasing <Col N="1519" /> this through on Committee Stage, one of the things I would like to have seen this tied to was another amendment I had tabled to the effect that local authorities should have the right to provide resources for communities organising themselves because there are many communities where even simple things like the establishment of residents associations and tenants associations tend to collapse because the resources are not there to keep them going.</P>
    <P>I have similar worries about the question of the local contribution because again, while I can agree with the principle where the local community is prepared to make a contribution to carry out a particular kind of work, I see two areas of danger.  One is that the Minister could well exploit it because where a community has been willing to provide resources for a particular matter, the Minister has tended to use it as an excuse to cut back on the allocation to the local authority.  I could see a situation arising where if, for example, a local community was prepared to put resources into the development of a public park the next thing that would happen is that the money from the Department of the Environment to local authorities would be cut back accordingly.  We have seen plenty of examples of this; where money is being raised in one way the Minister comes along and cuts it back another way.  The second area of danger is where people with different means live in an area where a referendum would be held.  There may be a very well resourced community which would have within its neighbourhood a pocket of individuals who might not be so well resourced where a referendum for the raising of money like this would place an undue burden on people who were in poorer circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am making those points not to oppose the amendment as such, because I agree with the principle that local authorities should have the power to conduct referenda and I think it is a vehicle that could be used quite constructively in many circumstances. I also agree with the concept <Col N="1520" /> of a local community, of its own accord, having the opportunity to make a contribution towards carrying out particular work in its neighbourhood if it sees fit. I am simply drawing attention to those points.  It is a pity we did not have the opportunity to tease this out on Committee Stage.  This is one of the problems we ran into when this Bill was going through and the detail was not properly gone into.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">

      <P>Like previous Deputies, I would be generally supportive of this amendment.  I would share Deputy Gilmore's apprehension about the question of halting sites and minority rights. This is one of the problems.  Our democracy is based on the concept of majority rule whether in this Dáil or in Northern Ireland, and this is not really the best form of democracy.  The Green Party have always advocated consensus type democracy.</P>
      <P>Having said that, there is a great deal of merit in this proposal.  Like Deputy Gilmore, I regret that this could not have been debated fully on Committee Stage. I can see one further flaw in it that would make the amendment indigestible as it stands, and that is in line 2 of the amendment where Deputy Howlin talks about a reasonable number of persons.  This would have to be more specific, perhaps 3 per cent, 5 per cent or 10 per cent or something of that order.  That would need to be put in before the amendment could be totally taken on board by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be contrary to what Deputy Howlin sometimes thinks but I did pay particular attention to many of his amendments, and to many of the other amendments as well.  Obviously, when a novel amendment is put forward it attracts one's attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's suggestion to hold a referenda on matters of local interest, that was proposed in amendment No. 12, was very interesting.  The idea seemed attractive at first and I considered it for quite some time.  However, before allowing myself to be drawn along by the idea I had to ask whether it was a practical <Col N="1521" /> proposition.  I know that the suggestion would be costly to take on board.  I tried to divorce from my mind that the holding of such a referendum would be costly and time consuming, that the machinery would need to be set up, that the issue would need to be spelled out in great detail in law and that many regulations would be attached to it.  When considering the advisability of going down that road I left out the cost factor, even though I knew that the provision would be costly.  More fundamentally, a requirement such as that suggested by Deputy Howlin &mdash; which is governed by his mandatory approach to this section, and that has already been illustrated in a few other sections as well &mdash; could serve to undermine the mandate vested in elected members by virtue of the fact that they are elected democratically.  The suggestion seemed to run counter to that basic principle in so far as elected members are concerned.  That is why I had to put up a red flag in that regard.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside that issue, I then considered that it would create difficulties for the practical day-to-day operations of local authorities if many decisions had to be made by way of the holding of referenda.  I am not talking about a minor item such as a leisure centre.  In the way it was framed the amendment could be applied to all items.  The Deputy would make the argument in reverse if the position were the other way around, so I am returning it to him with full compliments. If a whole range of items had to be decided by way of the holding of referenda the activities of many local authorities would become stagnant and local authorities would be involved in an ongoing formula that would bring much day-to-day disruption to their ordinary activities. For that reason I did not think the amendment as suggested by Deputy Howlin was practical, but it was an interesting idea.</P>
    <P>The idea of the holding of referenda in relation to the raising of funds is a different matter altogether.  I have to put in a very big marker there.  That idea would lead to considerable divergence and inconsistency between areas and even <Col N="1522" /> within a particular area if it were not likely that the approach would produce the kind of consensus needed to ensure a high level of payment.  Deputy Gilmore articulated the issue well when he talked about the differences that exist between areas within a particular administration. Although Deputy Gilmore did not couch it in quite these terms, I shall say that it is the difference of well off areas as against poorer areas which would not be able to generate the kind of revenue required for certain projects.  The differences in communities and the capacity for different communities to do certain things would create great difficulty and disparity in the kind of services and facilities provided in one area as against another. Although I am not about to rehash the issue, that brought home the point I made yesterday about the Minister being able to issue directions to different classes in different local authorities because of the differences that exist between the capacity of one area as against another to generate the resources and the capacity to deal with functions for communities. I smiled to myself while I listened to Deputy Gilmore, because I thought that perhaps in his recent interjection he better made the point I raised yesterday in relation to different areas and what they were capable of doing.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did make a reasonably good point when he said that a referendum could disadvantage certain groups.  That probably sums up the matter.  A referendum on some issues could disadvantage not just groups but also individuals.  I did not feel obliged to consider that matter further.</P>
      <P>However, I hope that Deputy Howlin will not feel threatened if I pursue the concept just a little longer, because it is interesting and is worth pursuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may not have pursued to finality the question of the raising of funds.  He may have confined himself to <Col N="1523" /> thinking about leisure centres and operations of that nature but I had to take the wider view.  I had to ask what kind of fund raising the Deputy had in mind.  I then had to ask what basis of assessment he had in mind to achieve that fundraising. First I wondered whether the Deputy wanted a poll tax or whether he was considering some other form of rates.</P>

      <P>One has to think of the normal kind of fund raising activities that the Deputy would have in mind.  I think we would have difficulties with those.  Is Deputy Howlin seriously suggesting that the whole collection of machinery for whatever new tax he has in mind would be spelt out on ballot papers?  That is the end result of his suggestion.  I do not know what other people would do with ballot papers that spelt out that money was being raised for a particular item or that they were being asked to give money, but I have a funny feeling that I can guess what many people would consider doing with those ballot papers.</P>

      <P>An Opposition Deputy made a suggestion about voluntary contributions. That is another matter.  Of course, voluntary contributions do exist in community arrangements with which we are familiar.  Some schools have voluntary arrangements whereby money is put forward to help out, and they often seek voluntary contributions for extra costs attached to their facilities and services. That also raises the question of equality.  As the Deputy himself stated, one area might have the management and organisational skills to do many things that other areas would not be able to do.  Differences would be created between communities.</P>
      <P>Apart from that consideration, if that is not what the Deputy has in mind and if he does not think that a new local tax is suitable, all I can do is express some amazement at his assessment of what is proper and fitting for local authorities and the local government system.  Certainly those two amendments would cause considerable confusion and a very bad reaction if pursued in the way contemplated and articulated.  While the amendments were interesting and would perhaps generate a little initial excitement, certainly on calm analysis of the potential dangers attached to them one would be led to ask that the Deputies withdraw the amendments.</P>

      <P>The Minister's contribution degenerated from the mischievous to the distorting.  It is very interesting that in all of the hours of debate on the Bill the only time the Minister willingly talked about money or funding was when he had the very faint and silly hope that all Members on this side of the House might rush to impale ourselves on some hook that he would like to dangle in front of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made our best efforts last night to get him to comment on the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1983, and he dillied and dallied and danced us around the country, but did he give us an answer, a comment on the clear promises he, his party and his colleagues gave?  We saw nothing like it. <Col N="1525" /> I suppose we must give him some credit for nerve, for sheer neck, on his attitude to funding.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of funding in this Bill, but if the Minister wants my views on how local authorities should be funded, I will give them to him.  We are not talking about funding local authorities in this provision, we are talking about an ancillary matter.  I will give details of what we propose in terms of local authority funding.  We have heard not a jot, a titter of wit from him about how he would fund local authorities which is the most crucial issue which will face everybody after 27 June.  Let him wise up and not try to treat all of us in this silly manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other Opposition parties' comments.  The Deputies are quite right.  It is a new idea that needs to be teased out further.  I did not suppose the form of words would be ideal.  In a normal Bill we would discuss the principles on Second Stage, the details on Committee Stage and get an ideal model on which we could have consensus on Report Stage. That is not the way this Bill was handled from the beginning.  The Minister does not want innovative ideas.  He does not want to build towards better legislation. He wants his own shallow ideas to be enacted into legislation.  We will all run to the country on the pretence of reform and that everything is hunky-dory.</P>
    <P>Regarding the concern expressed by one or two Deputies on the rights of minorities in particular, I tabled amendment No. 15, which I hope we can reach in the couple of minutes we have left, which seeks to safeguard the position of the underprivileged, the handicapped and minority interests.  It is important that that issue be addressed and I hope we have time to do that now.</P>
    <P>The Minister is talking about new taxation. He is very mischievous.  He is trying his best to distort.  Let us get our own house in order.  Let us try for once to build towards proper legislation and not be setting silly schoolboy traps.  Let us try to get provisions that will involve the community into the decision making process.  That is what this section is about. <Col N="1526" /> It is not about funding because the Minister has designed this Bill to exclude funding.</P>

      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 20 to 23.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 5 (4) and I want the Minister's view why this section is in the Bill.  We have discussed the representational role of local authorities but section 5 (4) provides that: &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall be construed as imposing on a local authority, either directly or indirectly, any form of duty or liability enforceable by proceedings before any court to which it would not otherwise be subject.&rdquo;.  I put this amendment down because that struck me as an &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; clause, that we can give at least some new functions, not nearly as wide as I would like, to local authorities or we can pretend to devolve functions to them.</P>
      <P>What is the point of putting anything into statute if an intrinsic part of the statute provides that you cannot construe it as having an enforceable duty?  I thought we were enacting into legislation regulations, duties and responsibilities which would be enforceable.  I ask the Minister to explain in the couple of minutes we have left why this section is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell and you, Sir.  I want to make two or three brief points.  We had a debate earlier on an amendment in my name and the names of a number of other Deputies providing that a local authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; represent the interests of a local community rather than they &ldquo;may&rdquo; represent the interests of a local community.  Now in this representational section of the Bill we are getting a provision that a local authority, if they feel so inclined, can represent the interest of a local community. In other words, if an Irish language programme shows people less clothed than the members of a particular local authority might like to see them, then the members of that local authority may write a letter to the RTE Authority complaining about it, but if the local community want their local authority to take up some issue and make a case for them, say, about policing, social welfare or a range of services, the local authority do not have to do anything about that.  They have no obligation to the local community who elected them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision removes the question of accountability of a local authority to the wider community.  In case that is not enough, the Minister has this section which provides that the local community have no comeback on the local authority if the local authority are not doing their job.  Normally, the electorate have the right to vote out a local authority where they are not happy with the way they are performing their functions, but in this legislation the urban council elections are postponed indefinitely.  The 1973 Act provides that local elections can be postponed. The Barrington report recommended that local elections should not be postponed but that their members should be appointed for a fixed term.  Here we are getting a system of local government where the local authority need not have any sense of accountability to the local community.  The local community have no comeback and the Oireachtas, if it sees fit, can postpone the local elections <Col N="1528" /> at will rather than hold them on the date they are supposed to be held.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is appropriate that we finish the debate on this Bill spending a few minutes on this section.  This is a classic case of the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.  This Bill can be summed up in the Minister giveth and the Minister taketh away. Under section 5 the Minister appears to give to local authorities the possibility of new functions, yet later in the Bill, soon to become an Act, even if they opt to take on certain functions, they may not do so if it is in breach of a direction the Minister can give.  He has the power to direct local authorities not to become involved in certain things.</P>
      <P>This is a very extensive power.  This whole section is conditional.  The local authority &ldquo;may&rdquo; represent.  Section 5 (4) to which this amendment refers ensures that nobody can take the local authority to task for not becoming involved in wider representation than has been the case in the past.</P>
      <P>In a sense, section 5 sums up the whole tenor, tone and meaning of this Bill.  It is a void.  It will make no impact in the sense of giving power and influence over local affairs back to the local people.  It purports to give extra roles or extra powers to local authorities.</P>
      <P>Later in the same section the Minister claws back that potential new role and new power.  The reality is that the one person who has a greater role, greater power, greater potential for interference, greater potential for clogging up the system and greater potential for further clobbering the local government system is the Minister.  He is the person who will have more extensive powers than ever before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to point out the importance of this recently discovered archaeological site at Ushers Quay.  It was more by chance than by direct archaeological digging that a very important Norman harbour was dis-discovered  intact at Ushers Quay, not too far from the Wood Quay site.  It is a strange irony that on this site we bear witness to perhaps the greatest bureaucratic blunder of all time, the civic offices now standing on the magnificent site of Wood Quay which is covered over for all time to the great shame of the authorities at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister is here today and that I have been afforded the opportunity of highlighting the importance of <Col N="1533" /> this site which is a great treasure for the capital city.  It is of significance that in the year that Dublin has been nominated European City of Culture we should do something about preserving this site.  As I have said it is the most important site since the discovery of the Viking site at Wood Quay.</P>
    <P>Dublin is rich in archaeological treasure.  I appeal to the Minister to conduct an archaeological survey of all derelict sites within the city boundaries.  Such a survey would reveal rich rewards.  It is not a question of taking a chance to see if there is treasure, artefacts or clues that give identity to the past culture of our capital city.  The treasure is there; it only has to be excavated.</P>
    <P>One great example is the site for the new Jury's Hotel.  It will be a scandal if this site is built on without it being properly excavated.  I ask the Minister to give the House an assurance that that will not happen.  There is a proposition to speed up that development and to carry out only a piecemeal type excavation, but that would not be satisfactory.  To just stalk the ground and hope that some treasure or site is discovered would not be the proper technique to use.  Dr. Clarke from Dublin University, who is chairman of the Friends of Medieval Dublin, has called for an archaeological survey, and I strongly support his views in that respect. There would be a spin-off to tourism and education and, indeed, to future generations. One of our greatest, exponents of this whole question, Father F. X. Martin, did great work in his day to bring to the fore the need to preserve all archaeological sites in Dublin.  He was to the forefront in the dispute about the Wood Quay site.</P>
    <P>Here we have a most important site which has just been discovered.  I went to see it on Saturday and would urge anyone with an interest in this field to go down and view it.  One can actually see part of the city wall of Dublin which is now a national monument and the remains of the harbour wall which kept out the tide, and some wood remains of boats.  It leads on to another area which I am sure would be a means of bridging the north of the <Col N="1534" /> city and the south.  The hurdles which give a clue to the very beginnings of our ancient city, Áth Cliath, the city of the hurdles, could be excavated quite easily. These remains are traced, to bridge between Augustine Street and Bow Street.  That could be unearthed and money should be made available for such research.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister, as a start, to make available £20,000 for this site, which the archaeologists, Damien McGarry and Leo Swann need urgently.  If the Minister gave that pledge today he would be going a long way in our year as Capital City for Culture to giving his imprimatur to doing all he can to preserve this site for future generations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the opportunity to comment on the important recent discovery of archaeological remains at Ushers Quay, Dublin.</P>
      <P>Dublin has a fascinating history and we are fortunate that sufficient archaeological deposits remain intact in order to significantly add to our store of knowledge of the origins of the city.  The area of the medieval city, approximately centred around Christchurch, has proved particularly fruitful to archaeologists over the past few decades.  Sites which easily spring to mind, in which valuable Viking and medieval remains were discovered, include Wood Quay, High Street, Christchurch Place, Winetavern Street and Fishamble Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Archaeological remains in urban areas present challenges as well as opportunities and it is with this in mind that, in 1989, the National Monuments Advisory Council published their <i>Urban Archaeology Guidelines.</i>  These guidelines provide valuable advice to developers, local authorities and others on how best to <Col N="1535" /> approach development in archaeologically sensitive areas.  The guidelines also endorse the established European principle that the cost of the investigation and conservation necessitated by such development should be borne as part of the cost of the development. This is particularly important given the increased pace of development generated by the success of the Government's urban renewal schemes.  Properly planned, archaeological conservation and property development need not be mutually exclusive.  Indeed, discoveries made can often enhance or be a feature of the new development.  Archaeology can, of course, also contribute to the growing importance of cultural tourism.</P>
    <P>The particular discovery raised by Deputy Gerard Brady is an important new feature not previously known to exist.  Although archaeological excavations in the past have unearthed early timber frontages to the Liffey, this is the first time that such structures have been discovered within the old city walls.  It is thought that the structure may have been a small harbour attached to a merchant's premises as large amounts of 13th century pottery were also discovered on the site. It is interesting to note that France was an important trading partner as far back as early medieval times.</P>
    <P>Another interesting feature discovered on the site was the north-west corner of the medieval city wall.  This is the point where the section of the wall parallel to the river swings due southward.  The timbers, having been fully recorded, will now be carefully lifted and preserved.  I am glad to note that the Office of Public Works are significantly contributing to the conservation effort by providing secure storage facilities and other services. Recommendations can now be formulated which will allow the developer devise a piling foundation which will be non-destructive to the archaeological features of the site.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the developer &mdash; Messrs.  Ballymore Homes Limited &mdash; who undertook the required archaeological excavation and have been very <Col N="1536" /> co-operative with the relevant authorities. I would hope that this example would be followed by everyone involved in development of areas which contain remnants of our national heritage.</P>
    <P>I assure my colleague, Deputy Brady, that his concern and recommendations will be noted by me, and will be fully investigated.  Every measure possible will be taken to ensure that preservation takes priority over everything else.</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrew Boylan has been given permission to raise the recent escapes from Loughan House, Blacklion, County Cavan, in particular two separate incidents in the last ten days when personal property was stolen or damaged and what action the Minister for Justice intends to take to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter this evening and I thank the Minister of State for coming in to debate it.</P>
      <P>On Saturday evening last five prisoners broke out from Loughan House; it was the second incident in the last ten days. Loughan House was a monastery until recently, occupied by an order of monks called The White Fathers.  As their numbers decreased they decided to vacate the property which was then acquired by the Department of Justice.  There was great disquiet in Blacklion, west Cavan at the change of ownership from the sedate White Fathers to the Department of Justice so that the premises could be used as an open prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that over a number of years a good relationship was built up between the prison and the residents of the area.  The prison governor and his staff are excellent people and have done great work to integrate the prison into the local community.  An excellent understanding was built up to the extent that there was deep involvement by the <Col N="1537" /> inmates and prison staff in the local community. They became involved in the local football club and other activities.</P>
    <P>What happened last Saturday evening set back a lot of that work.  I must lay the blame at the door of the Department of Justice because the Minister abused the purpose for which this prison was opened.  This prison was for minor offenders, people on short term stay.  It was designed as an open prison where generally young people could come to a tranquil scenic locality and would gradually be reintegrated into the community. Indeed, local residents, farmers and business people on numerous occasions used the services of the inmates, of their own free will, to help in hay making, turf making and in local business when the season was busy.  They praised the young people they were able to employ from Loughan House.</P>
    <P>The premises was not built for the type of offender who escaped.  I refer to a headline which has caused a lot of disquiet. I do not blame the press; they were correct in reporting and describing the type of prisoner now being sent there. The headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Wednesday, 15 May, ran &ldquo;Killer on loose after prison escape&rdquo;.  One can readily realise the effect of that and the fear that has instilled in the community.  I understand the escape has not yet been apprehended.</P>
    <P>It was never intended that a hardened criminal sentenced to eight years in prison for manslaughter would be sent to Loughan House.  It is wrong that because of scarce accommodation these people should be sent to a prison where such excellent work has been done.  That is a backward step and must be condemned. I ask the Minister not to allow such people to be sent to Loughan House because it was never intended for them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recent break-out, these people made their way to a local farm and took a jeep, which they crashed, causing damage in the region of £4,000.  I hold the Minister's Department fully responsible for the repairs to the jeep although it has been intimated to <Col N="1538" /> the owner that there will be no coverage by the State and he does not have insurance cover.  The responsibility must lie with the people who sent those prisoners in the first place to a prison which was not designed to hold them.  I do not attach responsibility to the staff, they carried out their work in an exemplary manner but their work is frustrated by the Department of Justice who see fit to send people to an unsuitable prison. Will the Minister give a clear undertaking to the people of the area that this kind of hardened criminal will not be sent to Loughan House and that there will be full compensation for damage to private property?  I would appreciate that &mdash; the people of the area would appreciate it &mdash; and it is the least to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The people in the area accepted a prison which was totally out of line with any developments or activities in the region, they worked with the governor and the authorities and an excellent relationship has been built up.  I hope that we can rebuild that relationship as a result of the undertakings in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to respond to Deputy Boylan's contribution on the Adjournment Debate pertaining to Loughan House.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that, as many of the matters referred to by Deputy Boylan, may result in criminal proceedings, I am constrained from commenting in detail on some aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say initially, however, that I am fully aware of the distress which incidents of this kind understandably cause local residents.  It has always been the practice on the part of the authorities at Loughan House to encourage good relations with the local community and there are many successful examples of that.  I would, of course, be very concerned that incidents of the kind referred to would tend to undermine these relations.  I agree with Deputy Boylan that we have an excellent governor, management and prison staff in Loughan House; they are a credit to the <Col N="1539" /> Department and to the State.  The excellent community relations which have developed over the years are also a credit to the people of the Blacklion area and in County Cavan in general.  We hope that the situation which has damaged those relations will be rectified and that they will again have good relations this year and in future.</P>
    <P>Open centres play a very valuable role in the operation of a civilised prison system, and as much care as possible, is taken in selecting offenders whom it is considered are suitable for and would benefit from the types of regime available at these centres.</P>
    <P>The open centres are designed to provide a relaxed regime for certain kinds of offenders which reduces some of the inhibiting effects of the closed institutions. They are suitable for offenders serving relatively short sentences or offenders serving sentences for the less serious offences.</P>
    <P>Open centres are also suitable for offenders who are nearing the end of long sentences, because better preparation can be made in that environment for eventual release into the community.  The risk of absconding from an open centre is, by definition, much greater, than that of escape from a closed institution.</P>
    <P>That risk is part of the price to be paid for continuing to operate open centres. Any absconding is regrettable but particularly one of this kind, where damage to property was involved.  It raises the question whether the risks ought to continue to be taken.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, for the sake of operating a balanced prison system, ranging from the strict custody to the relatively open, the open centres should remain.  I will, of course, take such steps as are possible to minimise the risks of absconding and their consequences.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that operational arrangements at all the prisons and places of detention are kept under review and special attention is paid to any deficiencies which may come to light as a result of the investigation of particular incidents.</P>
    <P>A routine conference of governors is <Col N="1540" /> due to take place in my Department tomorrow and I have arranged for issues relating to the operation of, and selection of prisoners for open centres, to be raised in that forum, particularly in the context of the type of incidents which have been mentioned in the House today.</P>
    <P>In relation to those incidents, I am glad to be able to tell the House that all seven offenders, who absconded recently, have now been returned by the Garda, and have been transferred to closed prisons.</P>
    <P>One of the seven prisoners to whom Deputy Boylan referred was serving an eight year sentence for manslaughter and was due for release on 8 November 1991. He was apprehended by the Garda last night and has been transferred to Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual to transfer a prisoner in this category who is nearing the end of his sentence to an open centre.  The open centre provides a better environment for preparation for eventual release into the community and this was particularly relevant in this case because the prisoner came from an area reasonably close to County Cavan.  Nevertheless, the drawbacks of this policy will be re-examined in the light of what happened.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of compensation, any application which the persons concerned wish to make will be considered but, in saying that, I do not wish to be taken as holding a view one way or the other in relation to such an application.  Full investigations into these incidents are being undertaken by the Garda, in the context of possible prosecutions, and by the governor of Loughan House, in relation to operational lessons, which might be learned from the incidents.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I believe that the continued operation of open centres is necessary in order to maintain a balanced prison system.  I hope I have made it equally clear, however, that I regard with great concern occurrences of the kind raised here this evening.  I assure the Deputy that I will arrange to have the specific points made by him taken up with the relevant authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter with a certain amount of frustration &mdash; and indeed anger &mdash; because I have to demand some kind of action from the Minister by way of legislation or regulation. I do not know whether responsibility lies with the Minister for the Environment or with the Minister for Justice, they are probably equally responsible.</P>
      <P>Cork Corporation have, over the last number of years, fulfilled their obligations to travellers.  I have been a member of the sub-committee for travellers for 11 years and in less than that time we have housed approximately 100 travellers in corporation houses in our area.  We have also implemented a policy of providing four halting sites in the city boundary.  Needless to say, discussions with residents groups have been long, protracted and bitter as the location of halting sites is a very emotional issue. Nevertheless we persevered and with the goodwill of many residents' groups and community associations we established the fact that four areas of the city would take a halting site each to cater for 40 families who were on our register at that time.</P>
      <P>Three of those halting sites are now up and running and a fourth is at the planning stage.  However, that is only the beginning of our problems because, while we have built three halting sites, there is now indiscriminate parking of caravans and trailers along city roads or on corporation property off the roads, about which the Garda apparently can do nothing.  We obtained a prohibition order but it appears that this is not worth the paper it is written on.  The officials of Cork Corporation are frustrated.  They reported the matter to the Garda who have told them that they are powerless to act because they are not a hindrance to traffic as they are on public property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is needed to resolve this major problem once and for all is legislation which the local authorities will be able to implement rapidly.  Approximately one month ago to clear space of ground in <Col N="1542" /> Cork city on which travellers had parked their caravans was cleared but last night the occupants of ten caravans filled in the trenches dug the night before in the presence of members of the Garda Síochána to prevent illegal parking.  They are now parked in that property.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter for us in Cork city.  I have written to Ministers and to the city manager who has informed me that he can do very little under the present legislation except go to court to obtain an injunction but this takes up a lot of time and money.  However, at the end of the day the Supreme Court have ruled that unless another halting site is available people cannot be moved on. We are bound by that ruling.</P>
    <P>I maintain that Cork Corporation have met their obligations and have provided sites.  It would appear however that Cork is a soft touch for traders and travellers, who arrive in convoys in Cork city.  They can do what they like.  They can park and trade where they like and create a huge mess.  Residents' associations have pleaded with me to raise this matter at national level.  I ask the Minister of State to contact his party colleagues in the area who I am sure would tell them the same story.  I demand that the Minister of State give a commitment to introduce some legislation to prevent the indiscriminate parking of caravans in local authority areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to place on the record of the House my role, the role of the Minister for Justice and the role of the Garda Síochána in relation to the parking of vehicles by members of the travelling community and others who travel from town to town offering various goods for sale, primarily during the summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite simply this: if a person, whether a member of the travelling community or otherwise, commits a parking offence such as parking in a dangerous manner; parking in a place prohibited, parking in an obstructive manner etc., it is a matter for the Garda to enforce the <Col N="1543" /> law in the same way, as they do when any other breach of the parking or traffic laws is detected by them.  However, in order for a parking offence to be committed, the person or people concerned, must have parked on a public roadway, which has been so designated by a road authority. I must make it absolutely clear to the House, that no breach of the parking regulations, or indeed any other road traffic related regulations, or by-laws, occurs unless the vehicles in question, are parked on a public road.  In the circumstances, vehicles parked on a piece of ground, which is owned either by a private citizen, a public organisation such as a local authority, health board, IDA etc., are not committing any offences, under the parking laws or regulations. Needless to say, when no offence is committed, the Garda do not, or cannot act.</P>
    <P>The question of removing alleged trespassers from property is a civil matter, and as such it is open to the owner of the property, to seek the intervention of the courts, to obtain an injunction against the alleged trespassers.  In any event, this being a civil matter it is outside my remit and the remit of the Garda.  I understand that in some cases, owners of property have obtained injunctions against trespassers.  The serving of injunction papers or other court documents is also a matter for the property owner, or his agent and again, the Garda have no function or role in the matter, however, I have been assured by the Garda authorities that if requested, gardaí will attend the scene, to prevent breaches of the peace, or the commission of any other criminal offence, which could arise.  I have to reiterate that the Garda have no function beyond this.  For example, they cannot intervene to force trespassers to leave property, even though the courts have ordered the trespassers to quit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> That is the broad picture in relation to parking of caravans, and other vehicles by members of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific situation in Cork &mdash; I do not intend to communicate with my party colleagues as I do not doubt the Deputy's sincerity and bona fides in raising the matter &mdash; the Garda authorities have advised me that at present a total of 79 caravans owned by members of the travelling community are parked in the precincts of Cork city, none of which is parked on a public road.  For the reasons I have outlined the Garda cannot act against these nor indeed do they have any function in relation to them.  I also understand that in the case of 44 caravans parked on property owned by Cork Corporation, the corporation have instituted court proceedings, to have them removed.  As I have indicated, neither I nor the Garda have a function in relation to any aspect of these matters and in any event I am precluded from commenting on a matter which is the subject of court proceedings.</P>
    <P>I share the frustration of the Deputy and that of many other Deputies who are charged with the responsibility under various Acts of providing proper accommodation for the travelling community. I have made a detailed submission with special recommendations to the Minister for the Environment.  I have asked him to consider introducing some kind of registration system which may preclude the kind of people we are talking of from travelling from place to place.  I am not sure if this is feasible under the law but the matter is being considered by the Minister.  I trust that this adequately explains the situation with regard to the entire legal process for the Members of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the recent Council, which was held on 18 April, in Luxembourg, was to conduct an initial exchange of views concerning the midterm <Col N="1475" /> review of the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
      <P>The Council was, in fact, the first fullscale ministerial debate on the future of the Community's fisheries policy.  At the meeting, I pressed strongly for further tangible recognition of the special position of the Irish fishing industry so as to allow it to continue to develop from the almost unique underdeveloped state in which it found itself in the seventies. This will continue to be Ireland's principal objective as the negotiations proceed.</P>
      <P>I also indicated at the Council that I will be pressing for the removal of constraints applied under the Common Fisheries Policy which prevent Ireland from exploiting fully the potential of our fishing industry.  In this regard, I have drawn the Council's attention particularly to the indiscriminate application of GRT restrictions and a less than imaginative structural policy, which in Ireland's case has prevented this country from fully utilising the quotas allocated to it by the Council itself.  I have also pointed to the present highly unsatisfactory situation whereby Irish fishermen are, to all intents and purposes, excluded from participating in third country fishing agreements. I look forward to continuing discussions with my European colleagues on these important issues.</P>
      <P>At the Council I drew attention to the extremely serious problem of illegal fishing by non-Community boats in waters to the south and south west of Ireland. The Council acknowledged the seriousness of the problem and accepted my proposal for co-ordinated Community action.  Subsequent to the Council, the Commission convened an urgent meeting of the countries directly concerned with a view to taking concerted action to remedy the situation.  At this meeting, arrangements were made for closer co-operation and the fast transfer of relevant information between member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the other issues discussed at the April Council were proposals for revised technical conservation measures, the collection of data on the landing of <Col N="1476" /> fisheries products and recent developments in fisheries relations between the Community and Namibia.</P>
    <P>As regards the quota for mackerel, as the Deputy will be aware, the total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas for 1991 were agreed following a series of lengthy and difficult negotiations at the December Council of Fisheries Ministers. At these negotiations, I secured actual increases for 1991 in quotas for a number of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; species, including mackerel, where the Irish quota has been increased from 70,550 tonnes in 1990 to 73,320 tonnes in 1991.  An additional 4,000 tonnes has also been secured by means of a quota swop with the UK, bringing the total amount of mackerel available to Irish fishermen in 1991 to 77,320.</P>
    <P>As regards herring, a potential increase in the quota for this stock must await the report of the Scientific and Technical Committee on Fisheries.  Subject to favourable scientific advice, I shall, of course, be raising this issue at Council level later in the year.</P>
    <P>As regards the review of the Common Fisheries Policy, the following is a synopsis of the progress to date: in early February 1991, the Director-General for Fisheries, Mr. Jose Almeida-Serra, visited Ireland to see at first hand the difficulties faced by the Irish industry and to engage in discussions with officials of my Department and representatives of the fishing industry in regard to the review; later in February, the head of the Commission Task Force on the review, Mr. Van de Poele, visited Ireland, again for a fact-finding and discussion visit; in March, I established a high-level group, consisting of representatives of the industry, officials of my Department, and independent experts, under the chairmanship of Dr. T.K. Whitaker, to advise me on the review; I have asked the group to make their report before the summer.</P>
    <P>Since December 1989 there has been in existence an interdepartmental group, consisting of officials of my Department and of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This group have met on a number of occasions and have made a significant <Col N="1477" /> input to the deliberations currently underway in Brussels in relation to the review.</P>
    <P>The Commission must make a report to the Council, in connection with the review, no later than the end of December 1991.  The Commission continues to work towards that deadline.  The Irish position on the review is being made known to the Commission at all possible levels, both political and official, for inclusion in the Commission's report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that there is any case for suspension of the licences granted to Salmara Limited on 15 February last to engage in salmon farming at Deenish Island, County Kerry and Inishfarnard, County Cork.  I am satisfied that the licensing decisions which I have taken in the matter are the correct decisions, based on a full assessment of all the objective evidence available to my Department and to me.  My judgments were based, and will continue to be based, on well-founded scientific advice and the standards and procedures applicable generally to development here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad of this opportunity to outline for the Deputy the basis for the licensing decision I have taken in connection with <Col N="1479" /> the Salmara operations in question, both in terms of the general considerations which applied and by reference to the specific issues adduced by Kenmare Community Development and which have been referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Licences, of one year's duration and restricted to 250 tonnes, were granted to Salmara on 8 March 1990 to engage in fish farming at the sites in question.  These licences were granted following completion of the environmental impact assessment process, which related to Salmara's application for 500 tonnes at each site, and my Department's assessment of responses received as part of the public consultative process inherent in that procedure.</P>
    <P>The one year licences were issued subject to review after 12 months in light of additional hydrographical studies and other environmental and technical data to be compiled during the year.  Account was also to be taken of the results of technical surveys of outer Kenmare Bay commissioned by BIM on behalf of my Department; ongoing water quality monitoring at the sites; compliance with licence conditions generally and the outcome of the investigations into the sea trout issue.</P>
    <P>The one year licences were subsequently rigorously reviewed by my Department in light of the comprehensive data accumulated in relation to these operations during 1990.  On foot of my Department's assessment, from technical, scientific and all other relevant perspectives, I approved, in February of this year, the issue of renewed licences to Salmara for the production of 500 tonnes annually at each site.  The licences, which are of ten year's duration, are subject to a number of specific conditions which complement, or are additional to, standard licence conditions and which cover in explicit detail such matters as the continued monitoring of the sea trout situation in the area; stocking densities; cage numbers and ongoing water quality monitoring requirements.</P>
    <P>It is a specific condition of the licences that they are subject to ongoing review <Col N="1480" /> in light of continued monitoring of and research into the two sites and neighbouring sea trout fisheries which will be undertaken in 1991 and forward years by the Salmon Research Agency and the Fisheries Research Centre of my Department. I would point out however that research work carried out in 1990 including an assessment of sea trout stocks in the Kerry region by the Salmon Research Agency produced no contra indications to suggest that the fish farms in question should not continue to operate.</P>
    <P>The effects of escapement of farmed fish continue to be widely debated and argued.  The Deputy can be assured that the development of thinking as articulated in all international and national fora, seminars and workshops is closely monitored and indeed is contributed to by my Department's scientific staff.  In line with current thinking as oultined by, notably, the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation, my Department's licence conditions incorporate the precautionary principle i.e. the minimising of the risk of escapes through optimum cage design and net specification. The scientific and technical advice available to me is that the presence of these fish farms does not represent a threat to the shellfish resource of the area.  It remains my view that salmon farming and shellfish development can continue to coexist in a mutually beneficial way.</P>
    <P>The objections and concerns of the Kenmare Environment Group and the views of the coastal communities of the Kenmare area, which, I should point out, included many expressions of support for the operations, were duly assessed and where sustainable, were taken into account in the course of the licensing process.  I would reiterate that the evidence available to me indicates that properly maintained fish farms do not pose unacceptable risks to the environment. Continued compliance with licence conditions including, for example, water quality monitoring, will ensure that this remains so.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy to ensure that aquaculture development takes place in a well regulated and orderly manner, in <Col N="1481" /> harmony with the environment and other interests, while maximising the industry's contribution to the economy.  The licensing decisions in question were informed throughout by these policy objectives and were underpinned by thorough going assessments of comprehensive data.</P>
    <P>I hope that my exposition of the facts will allay the concerns expressed by the Deputy and others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to the restrictions which currently apply under national legislation to Irish boats above a specified size fishing within a three mile zone from baselines.</P>
      <P>There is no specific law prohibiting vessels of a particular size from fishing within the three mile limit.  It is nevertheless the position that, as a general guideline, vessels over 90 feet are precluded by the terms of their sea-fishing boat licence from fishing within these limits.  These licence conditions are actively enforced although there have been no detentions or prosecutions for breaches of this specific licence condition within the past five years.</P>
      <P>There are, however, a small number of vessels of over 90 feet which are not precluded from fishing within three miles. The question of further reducing the number and size of vessel permitted to fish within the three mile limit is kept under regular review by my Department. In general my Department favour encouraging and/or requiring the bigger, more powerful sector of the fleet, including all large vessels and particularly those over 90 feet, to move further offshore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> As the Deputy is no doubt aware, only Irish registered fishing boats are legally entitled to fish within a six mile limit of the Irish coast.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my answer to his question of 20 February 1991 regarding the allocation of funds from the operational programme on peripherality.</P>
      <P>As I indicated then, a decision on the allocation of programme funds to Dún Laoghaire would have to await consideration of the development plan for the harbour, a draft of which was recently published by the Interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board and placed on public display.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All interested parties have been invited to express their views on the content of the draft plan.  These views will be taken into account before the board makes final recommendations to me on the nature of <Col N="1483" /> the developments to be undertaken at the harbour.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the present operational programme which is running from 1989 to 1993, is already far advanced. Given that the most optimistic date for the start up of the Dún Laoghaire project is towards the end of the current operational programme, it is unlikely that it could be considered for significant funding from this present programme.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated, however, my support for the retention of the ferry service to Dún Laoghaire Harbour and obviously consideration will be given to including the proposed developments of the harbour for funding from any future EC Structural Programme.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the aid being made available to certrain harbour authorities under the Operational Programme on Peripherality 1989-1993.</P>
      <P>The programme provides for substantial investment in ports over the period to 1993.  A total investment of about 88 MECU, approximately £69 million, is proposed, spread over the larger commercial seaports, as well as a number of local ports.  Of this investment, about 39 MECU, approximately £30 million, will be obtained from the EC in the form of grant-aid from the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme is divided into two sub-programmes.  The first, the peripherality sub-programme, is aimed at the larger commercial seaports and is to contribute to investments to offset the impact of Ireland's peripheral location; <Col N="1484" /> total cost, about £60 million.  The second, the sub-regional-development sub-programme, is aimed at key regional seaports, and though it is not of the same importance as offsetting the effects of peripherality, it is of significance to the development of industry and tourism at sub-regional or local level; total cost, about £9 million.</P>
    <P>The programme provides that harbour authorities, irrespective of their size or location, can receive grant aid of up to 50 per cent of their approved project costs.  As was indicated in paragraph 3.1.35 of the Government's National Development Plan, 1989-1993, expenditure will be concentrated particularly on Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford and Cork ports.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the level of assistance which Irish ports are receiving under the programme, is the maximum which could be obtained in the circumstances, taking account of the number of ports undertaking developments, and of economic and regional considerations.</P>

      <P>This application is currently being processed and my Department are in correspondence with the applicant.  I understand that clarification has been sought regarding the status of the boat which is proposed for deregistration.</P>
      <P>I should explain to the Deputy that, for a variety of reasons, a number of boats have gained entry to the sea fishing boat register where there is considerable doubt whether they properly met the criteria necessary for valid registration.  For example, in some cases, the boats may have been wrecked some years ago and did not exist at the time of registration.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that to accept such boats as replacement vessels would convey a totally unwarranted bonus to the owners involved.  It is against this background that my Department have adopted the practice of investigating where necessary the status of certain boats before accepting them as replacement vessels.</P>

      <P>Since I spoke on this matter on the adjournment on 14 February last, no new facts have emerged which would shed any further light on the causes of the sea-trout problem in western fisheries districts.</P>
      <P>The research effort to try to establish the cause has been intensified with extra funding from my Department and special arrangements are in train to assist the survival of the remaining sea-trout stocks in the affected rivers.</P>
      <P>The scientific research programme in place for 1991 will concentrate on investigating: the physiological mechanisms involved in the sea-trout's transition from freshwater to the sea; possible differences in the selected physiological parameters between depleted sea-trout stocks and those less severely affected; the dynamics of relevant brown trout populations, including interactions between the resident and sea run components of these stocks and the role of sea lice in relation to the above.</P>
      <P>I am very much hopeful that this research effort, which is being conducted in close collaboration with the Sea-Trout Action Group (STAG), will provide us at the very least with some pointers at the end of this year as to where the cause of the problem lies.</P>

      <P>All proposals for State or EC funding received from Dublin Port have been considered on their merits.

      <P>In relation to future funding for the port, the Deputy, as a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, will be aware that three projects from Dublin Port have been submitted for inclusion in the operational programme on peripherality which runs from 1989 to 1993. The board have already received £406,000 in EC grant aid in respect of two port projects.  Consideration will be given to submitting for funding any additional projects the board might put forward for inclusion in the present programme or any future programme.</P>

      <P>The national average family farm income figure is provided by the annual Teagasc National Farm Survey, the most recent of which relates to 1989. This survey gives a provisional estimate of farm family income of £6,907 for that year.  It must be emphasised that this figure relates exclusively to income earned from farm activities.  This means that because the survey takes into account only the income derived from farming and in the case of the large number of part-time farmers does not include their off-farm incomes, the average income figure is lower than that actually received by farm families.</P>

      <P>On the basis of data obtained by my Department from the insurance industry and the Department of the Environment, the average price of <Col N="1497" /> motor insurance in real terms, i.e. earned premium income as shown in the annual returns by motor insurers, adjusted to 1989 prices using the consumer price index, divided by the number of vehicles registered for road tax, showed the following year on year trends: 1985, increase &mdash; 8.1 per cent; 1986, increase &mdash; 11.5 per cent; 1987, decrease &mdash; 0.3 per cent; 1988, decrease &mdash; 1.3 per cent; 1989, decrease &mdash; 5.0 per cent.</P>
      <P>Increases in basic book rates notified to my Department in the latter half of 1989 are not fully reflected in the 1989 earned premium income.  As all motor insurers have not yet submitted annual returns for 1990 it is not possible to calculate the 1990 earned premium income and consequently a comparable figure for 1990 is not available.  However, as I informed the House on 26 February 1991, Official Report, column 1470 &mdash; the average of the increases in basic book rates notified to my Department in 1990 was 30 per cent.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in my reply to the Deputy on 21 November 1990, the ESB will operate their power station at Allenwood and Bord na Móna will supply turf to the station as long as supplies from the local Bord na Móna bogs permit.</P>
      <P>The latest indications are that there are sufficient reserves of sod peat available at the Ballydermot/Timahoe bogs to supply the ESB for the generation of electricity at the Allenwood Power Station for a further three-four years.</P>
      <P>The critical factor in relation to Allenwood Station is the ability of the ESB to operate there having regard to the age of the station and the possibility of a major breakdown occurring.  Because of this it is not possible to put a definitive timescale on how much longer Allenwood will remain open.  However, while operational plans by Bord na Móna and the ESB are being made on a year to year basis every effort shall be made to keep the station going while local turf supply permits.</P>

    <P>As I have pointed out before to the Deputy the timing of issue of creditors' payments is a matter for each individual agency to decide.  In considering the above figure the amount outstanding to creditors on any particular date is related to the timing of payments rather than an indication of financial performance.  The information relating to all voluntary hospitals is not readily available. However, it is estimated that the amount involved for the major voluntary hospitals would be about £5.5 million.</P>
