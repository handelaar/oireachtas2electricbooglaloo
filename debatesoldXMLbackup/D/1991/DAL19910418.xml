It is also proposed that all Stages of No. 11, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>In respect of reports which have appeared today about the well known problems encountered by teachers in maintaining discipline in schools and in view of the fact that there is no statutory basis for disciplinary guidelines in operation in primary schools, will the Taoiseach endeavour to speed up the rather relaxed time-table for the promised Education Bill which the Minister for Education has indicated the intention of introducing eventually? In view of the problems faced by teachers, will the Taoiseach speed it up?</P>

      <P>Provision is being made in this Bill to increase the amount of the emoluments and expenses of the President, other than salary, and to enable any future increases to be effected by Government Order.</P>
      <P>Article 12.11.2º of the Constitution requires that the emoluments and allowances payable to the President shall be determined by law.</P>
      <P>The existing legislation consists of the Presidential Establishment Act, 1938, as amended by the Presidential Establishment (Amendment) Act, 1973. Under section 1 of the 1938 Act, as amended in 1973, the emoluments and allowances of the President consist of personal remuneration at a rate equal to the rate of remuneration of the Chief Justice plus 10 per cent, and an additional sum of £15,000.  This Bill is only concerned with this latter amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is proposed is to increase the <Col N="379" /> figure of £15,000, which is largely spent on official entertainment, to a more realistic level in today's terms.  Careful consideration has been given to what would constitute a fair and equitable amount at this stage, allowing for developments that have taken place since the figure was originally fixed in 1973. We are satisfied that a figure of £100,000 is fully justified and this is being provided for.</P>
    <P>Also, in order to avoid the necessity of amending legislation should further increases be considered appropriate in the future, provision is being made to enable the amount to be increased by Government Order in future.  Such a procedure is now well established.  It applies, for instance, in relation to adjusting the remuneration of Members of this House, of Ministers and of the Judiciary and in relation to the allowances payable under law to leaders of qualified political parties.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the payment of a pension to the widower of a deceased President or of a former President. Under existing legislation, this benefit is only payable to widows.  The extension of pension cover to the spouse of a female President is in line with developments in public sector spouses' pension schemes in recent years, including the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) scheme which was amended on these lines in 1986.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party will not be opposing this Bill.  We welcome it.  It is time that the President had a proper allowance to carry out her functions, although the Constitution refers to &ldquo;his&rdquo; functions.  We must realise that this is amending legislation which will amend existing Presidential establishment legislation.  If the President is to have the amount for expenses increased, which of course this House will no doubt agree, we have to be prepared to ask &mdash; and this is no criticism of the President whom we all wish well in office &mdash; for a greater degree of accountability on <Col N="380" /> spending in Áras an Uachtaráin.  That is not a reflection on any person who holds the Office of President but this House does not have the right to review the role and duties of the President.  However, through the Committee of Public Accounts this House has the right to examine the accounting officer for the Vote for the President's Establishment, who at present is the Secretary of the Department of Finance, on the value for money of the expenditure.</P>
      <P>Under the Presidential Establishment Act, 1938 a person can be appointed to the post of secretary to the President on the approval of the Government.  I understand that additional staff have been appointed to the Office of President, which I do not object to in the slightest.  Indeed, it is long overdue. However, an explanation should be given to this House on the role, duties and status of staff in Áras an Uachtaráin.  In that regard it would be a good idea if the Secretary of the Department of Finance was to cease acting as accounting officer for the President's Establishment and that the President's Secretary was appointed accounting officer.  This can be done under statute by the Minister for Finance.  Far from making the President accountable to Parliament, this measure would strengthen the President's hand. At present Aras an Uachtaráin have to account to the Department of Finance who, in turn, account to the House via the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>Therefore there is the involvement of both the Executive and the Parliament in reviewing the role of the President in terms of spending.  The President is not answerable to either House, except in certain circumstances set down in the Constitution, or amenable to any court. We are talking here, not about the role of the President but about emoluments and allowances.  Like everything else in this area, money spent in Aras an Uachtaráin should be accounted for in a proper manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one of those people who is concerned so much &mdash; and I have said this as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; about the cost of <Col N="381" /> Government spending as about its value. We should realise that the Presidency is a valuable institution.  Incidentally, I was glad to hear the Minister mention in his introductory remarks that he is considering addressing other issues which will include the question of the remuneration of Members of the House.  I might mention in passing that it is time we made it clear that we have had enough bally-ragging from the media with regard to the payments and allowances to Members of this House.  Like priests, most of us have taken a vow of poverty since being elected to this House.  I want to say this quite clearly &mdash; and I hope the press will take note &mdash; I am paid less than half of what is paid to every witness who appears before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have to fight for my job every couple of years.  I have been elected to this House five times.  I have not yet been a Member for ten years.  It is time we stopped this nonsense.  Members of this House, the President and the Judiciary are entitled to be paid properly without cheap shots from journalists who are better paid and who have better working conditions than us.  It is time we stopped apologising for our existence.  We are entitled to be paid properly.  I work for the few bob I receive in this House.  I work in my constituency, in this House and as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have no objection whatsoever to a Head of State being properly remunerated.</P>

      <P>Now that Government Buildings have been given an uplift and the President is being better catered for, the Houses of the Oireachtas might expect that their Members be afforded better facilities such as proper office accommodation.  In passing may I say that Leinster House is the worst equipped head office in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> The President has fixed constitutional powers.  More power is assigned to the courts than to the President as constitutional guarantor.  However, the President does have important powers, many of which have not been used, some of which may evolve in time.  First, if the Dáil and the Government wish to restrict the time the Seanad may spend considering a Bill the consent of the President is needed under Article 24.1 of the Constitution.  Second, if the Seanad wishes to challenge a decision of the Ceann Comhairle on his certification of a Money Bill, it needs the agreement of the President before being able to appoint a Committee of Privileges to rule on the matter under Article 22.2 of the Constitution.  Third, a majority of the Members of Seanad Éireann, or not less than one-third of the Members of Dáil Éireann, may, by joint petition addressed to the President, request the President to decline to sign and promulgate as law any Bill, except a Bill to amend the Constitution, on the ground that the Bill contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought be ascertained.</P>
    <P>Three other important powers are exercisable on the President's initiative. The fourth power is that he may convene a meeting of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; the Constitution says &ldquo;he&rdquo; although, of course, we should now be referring to the President as &ldquo;she&rdquo;&mdash; a power which is presumably intended to cover circumstances in which the Government are unable or unwilling to convene such a meeting.  Fifth, the President has the right, instead of signing a Bill into law, to refer it to the Supreme Court for a decision on its constitutionality under Article 26 of the Constitution. The President may exercise that power like all the others so far mentioned only after consultation with the Council of State.  But the President has a sixth power: the right to refuse a dissolution of the Dáil to a Taoiseach who has ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Other powers can be conferred on the President by Act of the Oireachtas.  Since <Col N="383" /> we are increasing the allowance of the President in this manner we should consider conferring additional powers on the President, by law.  This was done under the Republic of Ireland Act, 1948, which repealed the External Relations Act, 1936, when all executive powers in connection with external affairs were assigned to the President acting on the advice of the Government.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but it is clear to me that he is straying considerably from the Bill before us which has to do with the Presidential Establishment and emoluments thereof.  At this stage I want to remind the House that it is a long-standing convention here that the President be regarded as outside and above debate in the House.  Debate on a Bill of this kind relating to emoluments and expenses of the President should be conducted objectively without alluding to the occupant of the office.  I would ask Members to bear that in mind.  The powers, duties and responsibilities of the President are matters for another day.</P>

      <P>I will show that I am speaking to the Bill before the House which amends the Presidential Establishment Act, 1938, and the Presidential Establishment (Amendment) Act, 1973, copies of both of which I have in front of me.  I will show that I have not alluded to the present President in any personal way except to extend to her some kind wishes and make some complimentary comments.  Seeing that we are increasing the amount available to the President I am arguing that, in so doing, we should confer on her by law &mdash; which we are entitled to do &mdash; extra or additional powers which was done in 1948 under the Republic of Ireland Act.</P>

      <P>Despite all the fears expressed in the course of the 1937 Constitution debate that the President would become an alternative source of power to the Government &mdash; an office some Deputies thought the late President de Valera was creating for himself for that purpose &mdash; it has to be said that that fear was held without foundation.  Presidents of Ireland, all of whom have served this country with dignity, nonetheless have been what might be described as political Trappists, silent on any matter that could be perceived as being political.  Unlike most European Heads of State, who are either monarchs or elected Presidents by Parliament, Ireland has a popularly directly elected President albeit one who gains office through a very restrictive nomination procedure.</P>
      <P>Nine years from the 21st century it is time for reform.  It is time to give the President a new role.  The current President is relatively young and has the unique advantage of being one of the few female elected heads of State in the world.  These additional assets, unique to the Presidency so far, could be put to work in a special way to the benefit of the country without putting the President in conflict either with the Executive or the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If she is willing and able, let us give her the tools with which to do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution provides for a Presidential Commission consisting of the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann, the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann and the Chief Justice.  The Presidential Commission acts in place of the President when the President is incapable of acting or is out of the country.  Could not this commission, by agreement of this House and the Seanad, the President and the Chief Justice, be asked to review the role of the President to see what additional powers might properly and profitably be conferred on the President?  Such a commission could receive submissions from the Houses of the Oireachtas and the public and report within a relatively short period.  Among the powers which could be conferred on the President, and which <Col N="385" /> the Fine Gael Party would submit should be conferred on the President are that the President should be invited to make an annual address to the Members of the Dáil and Seanad, an address which should be televised to the nation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is straying considerably from the rather limited Bill before us.  I would ask him to please have due regard for the admonitions I have already conveyed to him and to the House generally.  The matters to which he refers are extraneous.  This is a very limited Bill concerning expenses. The functions, the obligations or the personalisation of the position of President should not arise.</P>

      <P>The Bill which is being amended refers to the President's allowances, salary and pension and that of his widow or her widower.  I suggest &mdash; and I am nearly at the end of my contribution &mdash; since we are nine years off the 21st century and since we have a new President, irrespective of who the person is, and since we are substantially increasing from £15,000 to £100,000 the amount which is available, and which I support, it might be appropriate to consider or at least to put on the record &mdash; since we do not often get the opportunity &mdash; that we might confer by law, which we are entitled to do under the Constitution, additional powers on the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President could chair an overseas development commission; the President could be given a consultative role in the making of judicial appointments; the President could be chairperson of a permanent judicial commission and president of an environmental council.  There are lots of jobs the President could be given.  I would like to see the President given the job of appointing commissions, such as the electoral commission so that we would all know there was an honest broker and we would not have anybody in this House suggesting that there was any favouritism, no matter who was in Government.  I will finish on this point since I do not want to be in conflict with the Chair.  There are additional jobs <Col N="386" /> which could be conferred on the President.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for that consideration because in the opinion of the Chair he has strayed quite considerably from the rather limited Bill before us this morning. I would hope that is sufficient for him to have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we are talking about the role of the President I recommend that those additional powers be at least considered and perhaps the commission I suggested could be established to look at this.</P>
      <P>In relation to expenditure, we are entitled to know the cost of the Presidency. The difficulty we have with this Bill is that it is a Presidential Establishment (Amendment) Bill, but the cost of the Presidency is not entirely covered by the Presidential Establishment Vote. That is only one element of the cost of the Presidency because costs are borne on the Army Vote, the Office of Public Works Vote, the Taoiseach's Vote, the Foreign Affairs Vote, the Finance Vote, the Department of Justice Vote and perhaps others where entertainment and travel are involved.  It is fair to say that the figure which was recently presented to the Committee of Public Accounts was just £1 million.  That is very good value for money in terms of the role the President plays as guarantor in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>It would be a good thing if, when this money we are voting here today is accounted for, that a note be put on the account showing the amount expended in other Votes so that when the Vote comes before the House &mdash; having been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General in due course &mdash; it will show the actual cost of the Presidency.  People are entitled to know that and we should not be afraid to look at the value of the Presidency and not its cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made a number of suggestions today including the suggestion that we might consider appointing somebody from the President's Office, perhaps the Secretary to the President, as the <Col N="387" /> Accounting Officer instead of the Secretary at the Department of Finance for the reasons given.  If we are going to do the job properly let us sweep away the cobwebs, let us give the Presidential Establishment proper standing and let it be properly funded; let us not be afraid to do this.</P>
    <P>We will be supporting this legislation. I would like to say in conclusion &mdash; and I am sure I will be joined by the rest of the House &mdash; that I wish the President every success in her term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to be able to welcome this Bill to the House.  I would like to put on record my party's appreciation of the fact that the Government responded so generously and so promptly in their busy legislative programme to a need that was recognised by many people could have been put on the long finger.  It would be discourteous and ungracious of people on this side of the House, who had some role to play in having the current incumbent of that office elected, not to recognise the political realities and to extend our appreciation to the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Government in this regard. I mean those comments sincerely and generously.</P>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you have drawn our attention to the fact that this is amending legislation and confines itself primarily to additional expenditure.  I concur with some of the comments and observations made by Deputy Mitchell. The nature of the Irish Presidency, while it is clearly set out in a law, has evolved, and will continue to evolve, as much by the style of the occupancy and the activities that are undertaken by the present President as well as by previous Presidents. Just as we have seen the Supreme Court within our Constitution evolve organically within the framework of law that it is constituted upon, I believe also that the Irish Presidency will evolve and is evolving.  The recent direct election initiated a debate that brought about that evolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional resources which this Bill <Col N="388" /> intends to provide are an essential component of that evolution and I, therefore, welcome the fact that this amount of money is being made available.  In relative terms, given the task that the Office of the Presidency has to undertake and having regard to the frequency of demand, there are probably two to three visits every day to Áras an Uachtaráin. One only has to look at the newspapers to see the amount of activity being undertaken by the Office of the Presidency to recognise that over a period of 360-odd days the amount of money involved is not a dramatically large sum.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the fact that the Office of Áras an Uachtaráin, the third House of the Oireachtas, took the initiative of extending an invitation to all the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I hope that that initiative &mdash; which in my time in this House, since 1977, never happened before &mdash; would become an annual event and that the hospitality and the generosity of the Office of the Presidency would be extended to Members of this House in the manner that was initiated on 19 March.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Minister of State responsible that there is a major job to be done on the building of Áras an Uachtaráin.  The concept of the Presidency is a fundamental republican one. When one reads the history of the debates one sees that the reason the drafter of the Constitution wanted our President to be directly elected by popular vote rather than indirectly from the Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;as is the case in countries like Italy or the Republic of Germany&mdash;was to make a very clear philosophical political statement, that the representative source of power and authority came directly from the people and was vested in the representative of the people by the personage of the President of the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind de Valera's drafting of the Constitution in the thirties was to contrast it in a very fundamental way with that of the monarchy in Britain, which was obviously the country from which we were disengaging at that time. An extension of that representative role <Col N="389" /> of the Presidency would be the consolidation of the building of Áras an Uachtaráin and developing it in a manner that would enable a regular flow of visitors to go to Áras an Uachtaráin, independent of the President being present.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the idea that has been informally discussed, that there would be a presidential museum or a history of the evolution of the Presidency where, independent of the timetable of the President, it would be possible for members of the public on a regular basis to visit Áras an Uachtaráin and tour the building.  As part and parcel of that tour they would be able to see in an appropriate form the history of the evolution of this State politically and the precise history of the Presidency, including previous incumbents.</P>
    <P>I am making those careful remarks to the Minister because I believe this is an appropriate task for the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance to contemplate.  The work done in recent times in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham, Dublin Castle or the College of Science next door is of a quality that has been recognised by many people.  We do not have very many major public buildings and we should invest in them a degree of attention and care which reflects the sovereignty of this independent Republic.  That sovereignty and independence in its manifestation will become even more important as we move closer to some form of European integration and political unity.</P>
    <P>I would concur again with Deputy Mitchell in relation to the value for money as represented by the Presidential Establishment and the fact that there is a wide range of jobs and tasks that can be undertaken by the Presidency.  We have seen some evidence of that already in the volume of activity that is reported daily in the newspapers by the present incumbent of that office.  I do not think it is appropriate here to talk about giving extra legislative powers to the Office of the Presidency; we are talking about making extra resources available.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposal in the Bill that the sum of money should be increased to <Col N="390" /> £100,000 and that any subsequent increases should be brought about by way of Government order rather than additional legislation.  I would suggest that, in consultation with the Office of Public Works, the Presidency and the Department of Finance, Áras an Uachtaráin, which is a large establishment and an old building, needs to be looked at.  The possibility of a properly structured Presidential facility to which ordinary citizens could visit should be considered.  We have to underpin and underwrite on a continuous basis the political education of our citizens.  We should give them access to the institutions of the State so that they can take pride in them and we should make them available to the public in a manner that has not been done in the past.</P>
    <P>The Presidency is the third House of the Oireachtas.  It is an institution which, quite frankly, has been substantially strengthened as a result of the electoral process of last November.  While it gives me and my party some pleasure to have been an active participant in that process, the outcome for everybody in the State, after such a long lapse between elections, has been to improve the health of our democracy.  It is most unlikely that there will not be an election for the Office of Presidency having regard to the experience of last year.  In that context and against that background, the additional resources which are being made available in this Bill &mdash; I presume it will be passed &mdash; should be consolidated with the development of the sort of proposal to which I have already referred so that citizens will be able to visit Áras an Uachtaráin. I would like to indicate quite clearly that we welcome the introduction of this Bill and compliment the Government for bringing it forward so quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Worker's Party will be supporting this Bill.  We think it is appropriate that resources consistent with the dimension and importance of the role of President should be updated in the manner suggested.  I, too, would like to compliment the Government for responding to an undertaking given by <Col N="391" /> the Taoiseach in the immediate wake of the recent presidential election to bring forward a measure such as this.  If we see the Presidency as a resource, and a very important resource both domestically and internationally, it is clear that the stipened allocated, as amended in 1973, is hopelessly out of date.  Therefore, the measure before us today is both desirable and necessary.</P>
      <P>Most people would agree that the evolution of the office as referred to by Deputy Quinn is now a fact of life.  Both the role and the Office of Presidency has changed utterly and is unlikely to revert to the more restrictive parameters we have known.  The Ireland of the nineties is clearly not the same as the Ireland of the thirties.  Whereas all previous holders of the office performed the functions with integrity and dignity, it is fair to say that the office was somewhat remote from the people.</P>
      <P>The evolution of the office has very broad, indeed unprecedented public support. The recent opinion poll showing an approval rate of about 75 per cent bears out that what we are doing in this House today has the support of an unprecedented majority of the Irish people. Therefore this is the kind of active, working, relevant Presidency that they would like to see, that they greatly admire, respect and take pride in.  Perhaps the absence of elections for the office for so many years caused its importance and significance to fade somewhat from the public eye, but it certainly has been elevated to a stature that the Irish people require.  If the resource that is Áras an Uachtaráin is to be thrown open to the people in so far as possible, it is necessary that this House vote sufficient moneys for the performance of those duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the invitation to the Members of this House to visit Áras an Uachtaráin.  That was a very interesting experience for all of us.  I was quite surprised to find that Members of the Oireachtas, who have been very long serving Members indeed, had never been invited to Áras an Uachtaráin.  One <Col N="392" /> Member told me that although he had served for 32 years he had never, in all that time, had the opportunity of accepting such an invitation.  My understanding is that such an invitation, for example, will issue to this House at least once in the lifetime of every Dáil, which we would all agree is a desirable and very positive development.  Similarly, it is widely known that it is the intention of the present incumbent in reciprocating civic receptions held in her honour to do so in the only feasible manner, by inviting local authority members or whatever to Áras an Uachtaráin, since it is clearly not possible to invite everybody they represent. There are costs involved in an active working role for the President and I commend the Government for bringing forward this measure.</P>
    <P>The second section merely deals with a requirement to introduce equality to the legislation in terms of the benefit that could be availed of by a widow of the President up to now.  It requires that the same benefit should be conferred on the widower.  This reminds me of the time, many years ago, when I was a trade union official and had the honour, in retrospect &mdash; although I considered it an honour then too &mdash; to progress the very case taken by the present incumbent of the Presidency when she challenged this measure before the Employment Equality Agency and the Labour Court in respect of the scheme which operated in this House leading, ultimately, to the amending legislation of 1986.  It is extraordinary to think that, a short number of years ago, widowers of this House did not have the same rights as those conferred by the widows and orphans scheme which applies to Members of the Oireachtas.  Some 13 or 14 years later, I am very proud to have a small hand once again in ensuring that that measure of equality is introduced to the legislation.</P>
    <P>I accept your strictures, a Cheann Comharile, in terms of the comments you made earlier about remarks we would all like to make at another time concerning the possible broadening of the legislative scope of the Presidency.  We had an <Col N="393" /> opportunity not too long ago to discuss that matter in the House and the kind of commission to which Deputy Mitchell referred was put down by way of amendment by my party during the debate at that time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the plea which Deputy Quinn made to the Office of Public Works in respect of the building itself, my colleague, Deputy Mac Giolla told me that it may be possible to look at some 25 acres of land adjacent to Dublin Zoo. It is not an area in which I have any expertise but I am advised that if, for example, making that additional land available could be contemplated for Dublin Zoo, it would make a considerable contribution to enhancing the quality of life of a great many people in Dublin who visit the Zoo; it would also enable Dublin Zoo to tackle many of their present problems.</P>
    <P>It is also appropriate that measures built into the legislation now will make the updating of this kind of stipend unnecessary in terms of legislation like this in future.  Perhaps there should have been a subsection relating it to the cost of living on a yearly basis as, for example, the arrangement regarding the President's salary and the relationship with the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>It is the unequivocal view of the people that the measure we are enacting today has their support.  It is evident that the media focus which has been consistently on the work of the new President is welcomed by the people.  The use of the offices to the bounds which the Constitution permits is something which all citizens of the State appreciate and hope will continue.  The recent visit of the President to London was an historic one as it was the first time a President had visited Britain.  This kind of pushing out the frontiers of the office is what the people approve of and which they have grown to expect and we should be happy to buttress it financially in this House.</P>
    <P>Fuair mé teachtaireacht ón bpobal seo agus mé ag dul timpeall.  Teastaíonn Uachtarán uainn gur féidir linn bheith bródúil aisti, ach níos mó ná sin, gur féidir linn bheith bródúil lena chéile toisc gur <Col N="394" /> Éireannaigh sinn agus go bhfuil traidisiún agus cultúr álainn againn.</P>
    <P>That is the spirit in which this House should agree the legislation.  It is true that the people now take great pride &mdash; and always have&mdash;in their Presidency.  I hope that there will be agreement in this House on this measure and, like Deputy Gay Mitchell and Deputy Quinn, I should like to extend my best wishes to the President for continued success in her office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I researched and prepared a fairly lengthy contribution based on the fact that it is the first time we have been able to talk about the momentous event in November last year and its outcome.  However, I will respect the position of the Chair and the confines of the debate.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that we, so quickly and in a non-contentious way, are amending the moneys voted to the President's Establishment.  The money allocated for previous Presidents for entertainment purposes was set in 1973 and I have the greatest sympathy for the man and his wife who have just left that office.  I question how he could have played the role in entertaining on the meagre amount that was given to him.</P>
      <P>I also question why that was not recognised and why the former President did not identify the problem, did not pursue it and get satisfaction.  Indeed, I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the former President Hillery and his wife as he carried out his duties with decorum and honour.  I sincerely regret we did not have a debate in this House or commendation for the role he played.  I know that many people &mdash; including myself &mdash; have a great deal of respect for him and he should be told that Ireland appreciated his role during his time in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now we had always presumed that in the event of an office holder dying the benefactor was always a woman.  In this Bill we now recognise that the President's husband is entitled to the protection of pension legislation the same as everybody else.  I would point out to the <Col N="395" /> Minister of State that, as Deputy Rabbitte said, we have changed the situation in regard to TDs and Senators but I do not think we have changed the situation relating to Ministers and Ministers of State.  I remember my husband, who works in this area, saying to me when I was a Minister of State that if anything happened to me he would not be covered under our legislation.  When I mentioned this I got the most bizarre response that if I was killed there would be a huge emotional upheaval and something would be rushed through the Dáil.  I wonder if anything has changed since then, because there are women Ministers in the Deputy's own party and they and their husbands are entitled to protection in the event of anything happening to them.  I hope this House and the public are sufficiently mature to realise that we need amendments in this area.  Why are we so afraid to make such changes?  If such equality legislation exists for Deputies and Senators, and now for the President, we should have it at every level.  I would ask the Minister of State to check that to see whether something has been done in the Finance Bill that I am not aware of.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that there is a section which allows for the review of the emoluments for the President.  In my opinion £100,000 is really nothing when one considers the events with which the President is at present associated and her potential for developing the style of Presidency she intends.  That £100,000 is very little.  Dare I say it should be twice that if she is to perform as effectively as I know she would want to?</P>
    <P>The style of Presidency we now see has had wonderful effects.  Opinion polls have shown how pleased the Irish people are with the type of Presidency that President Robinson has now developed.  This is very good for the country and for morale abroad.  The image of a Head of State is very important.  There is a certain amount of diplomatic excitement attached to the visit of a Head of State.  We all know how people perk up and inquire about the country this person represents. <Col N="396" /> When President Robinson was elected it caused a stir throughout the world.  I am quite sure she will be a wonderful ambassador for Ireland worldwide.  She has had many invitations to travel.  This was an unprecedented election.  As people abroad saw it, we had a liberal feminist President elected in what they perceived, because of the kind of publicity we got in relation to ridiculous family planning legislation and so on, as a country where the status of women was very low indeed.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Fennell had listened to the Ceann Comhairle she would have heard him advise that particularising regarding the personality, outlook or characteristics of the President, is not in order in this debate. The Deputy will appreciate that if it were it would lead to confrontation in so far as every Deputy would have his or her own views.  The Deputy can appreciate that it would not be desirable for the high office of the Presidency or the holder of it.  I would ask her to endure whatever impediment she feels that imposes on her.</P>

      <P>This election has considerable effects out there in Irish society and I am glad that we are amending this aspect right away.  It points up the need for action in other areas of Irish society where there is a noticeable lack of interest in the fact that we have a woman President.  I speak of those clubs whose doors are closed to our first citizen.  It is an insult to our President and to every woman in Ireland that there are so many golf and other sporting clubs who would ban her as a member because of her gender.</P>

      <P>I reluctantly defer to your ruling.  It is time Supreme Court judges, if they are implementing the law, questioned the clubs of which they are members.</P>
      <P>I want to take issue with some of the comments made by my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  The Chair will probably rule me out of order again on this point.  Deputy Mitchell suggested that there should be quasi-political rules for the President.  This would make some sense if a President wanted to set up a commission but I would be terrified that a President would get involved in quasi-political or party political issues.  Every issue in this country is party political.  I do not believe this is always in the best interests of people, whatever their role or status.  Unless it was being changed for very good reasons I would absolutely oppose any change in the role of our President.  Our President has to be independent and has to be seen to be independent. We know that this is the type of Presidency Irish people want.  If the Presidency has to be about anything it has to be about giving Irish people the type of Presidency they want in this Republic.  We should be vigilant in ensuring that the needs of the Presidency, as they are defined and are being developed by the present President, are protected. For example, we should ensure that a President does not have to work on a budget of only £15,000 a year.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister of State to say in his reply what role Ministers and Ministers of State have to play.  This will be of concern to me when I am a Minister of State.  I should like to take this opportunity of wishing the President and her family well in the future.  They have a long road ahead of them and I am sure they will have to cope with many difficulties. I commend them on the job they are doing at present, and I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure to be here this morning to speak on this Bill.  Even though it is a short Bill I commend the Government on their prompt and positive response to the real needs of the Presidency.  The Office of President has been enhanced and has received international recognition since President Robinson's inauguration.  I hasten to add that this is not a reflection on previous Presidents.  The election of President Robinson has been an incredible break-through not just for the women of Ireland but for all the people of the country.  As the Minister and Deputy Quinn will be aware, the positive international response to the election of President Robinson has enhanced the position of this State in the world.</P>
      <P>I should like to put on the record my admiration of the democratic way in which the Presidential election was held, the way in which the views of the electorate were manifested during that time and the dignified way in which all the political candidates in the election behaved.  The election of President Mary Robinson was welcomed by all political parties.  People from other countries, particularly democratic countries, have told me that they regarded the election of President Mary Robinson as a model in a democratic sense.  Women throughout the world regard President Mary Robinson not just as a role model for Irish women but as a role model for women everywhere.  We are almost unique in the world in having elected, by public mandate, a woman President.  Her excellent qualities were recognised from the very beginning and we can justifiably be proud of her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The election of President Mary Robinson has been a matter of great national pride and celebration, particularly for women.  It has also been a celebration of our democratic system in that it has given recognition to the different branches in <Col N="400" /> our public life.  Since her election President Robinson has enhanced and broadened the office of the President in so far as she has consistently kept it above party politics.  Like Deputy Nuala Fennell, I believe this is crucial and very important. She has ensured that she is the type of President envisaged by our Constitution, that is a President for all the people and not just a President for certain groupings. She has brought home to all of us the pride we should have in this young fledgling State.  We should ensure that the structures which have been set up under our Constitution are maintained with dignity.</P>
    <P>We are living in changing times.  The election of President Mary Robinson is an indication of the incredible changes which are taking place not just in Ireland but throughout the world.  If in the future we see an extended role for the Presidency I hope there will be all-party agreement on the introduction of such changes. Perhaps the powers of and the restrictions on public representatives could also be considered at that stage.  We should always keep an open mind on how we can best serve the people who have elected us.  The Presidential election raised questions about the powers, responsibilities and dignity not just of the President, which was the pivotal debate, but of all public representatives.  The people of this country are well served by hard working public representatives.  This is something of which we should be proud.</P>
    <P>What I saw emerging from the Presidential election, particularly from the model offered by the President, was a renewal of pride in our structures and of our willingness to look at them to see how they can be developed in the future. I welcome the good relationship, the trust and confidence at work between the Government and the President as that is where most of the communication at public representative level must lie.  This Bill is an indication of our pride in and support for the Presidency.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Houses of the Oireachtas that a power of the President relates to her right to address both <Col N="401" /> Houses of the Oireachtas after consultation with and advice from her Council of State, perhaps on special occasions.  As Deputy Fennell said, the Presidency would not in this way interfere with the work of the House.  We should perhaps come together with the President to look at how we should chart the future. This would be of tremendous interest to the public particularly now that both Houses can be broadcast publicly.  This is a time of public communication, of opening up structures to the public.  The broadcasting facilities in the Dáil might be put to good use if all of us came together giving the President the pleasure and the privilege of addressing us.  I do not intend to comment on the activities of the President or to advise or insist on what she should do, but I am very much aware of public interest in these Houses particularly when we are highlighting special occasions.</P>
    <P>As our future is opening up in Europe in the nineties, we have global communications. Perhaps one of the reasons we had such international interest in the Presidential election here and in the fact that Mary Robinson was elected President was due to the global communications now open to us.  I was amazed at the level of reporting, of articles and of broadcasting there was about Ireland during that period and after the election.  It bodes well for the future.  This is a time of celebration for women and for men.  It is a good reflection on our democracy and structures.  I wish the President and her family many productive years, and happiness and success and I congratulate her on representing us so well.  I look forward to taking part in future discussions <i>vis-á-vis</i> our Presidency and the other structures of our State.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed so warmly to this debate.  I thank them for their generous comments about the Bill and the President.  It is indicative of the magnanimity of the Taoiseach as Head of the <Col N="402" /> Government, that he responded immediately to the suggestion that there was need to increase the allowances for the Office of the President, so that the President could fulfil her role to the maximum interests of the country.  It also shows the positive attitude of the Government to this need.  We are grateful for the co-operation of the House and we were delighted to be able to respond so quickly with this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to accountability and asked whether the Secretary to the President should be the Accounting Officer for the Vote for the Presidential Establishment rather than the Secretary of the Department of Finance. This matter does not arise under this Bill. Nevertheless, I will refer the matter to the Minister for Finance.  It is something we would have to be very careful about. I assure Deputy Mitchell that under the Interpretation Act the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; encompasses all genders within the Constitution and within all Acts.  It includes all persons irrespective of gender, class or creed.</P>

      <P>The Deputy need not have any worries.  The other costs pertaining to the Office of President which was referred to by Deputy Mitchell did not arise under this Bill.  The same applies to Deputy Quinn's suggestion about the Áras building, and Deputy Rabbitte's comments about land for the Zoo.  I concur and thank Deputy Quinn for his warm comments, particularly about the Office of Public Works.  I will pass them on to the chairman of the commissioners. With regard to the Áras building, it is a very beautiful and architecturally important building and I will pass the Deputy's comments to the chairman of the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been very fortunate that over the years all the holders of the Office of President have performed to a very high standard and with great dignity.  Like Deputy Fennell I, too, pay a warm tribute to the former President, Dr. Hillery and <Col N="403" /> his wife Maeve.  Like his predecessors, he was a very warm and outstanding President. We wish them both well in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell raised a query whether spouses of female Ministers were covered for pensions under existing legislation. As of now they are not but we propose to rectify that as a result of the recommendations in the Gleeson Commission report which recommended that this anomaly be corrected.  The legislation covering this is in the course of preparation and we hope to rectify the matter reasonably soon.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Fennell meandered into areas outside the realms of the Bill, I am sure she is pleased with the recent decision taken by Bord Fáilte as investment co-ordinators of structural funding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point originally raised on Second Stage by Deputy Mitchell, is it possible by Government decision to make the Secretary to the President the Accounting Officer accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the Presidential Vote?  Would it be possible for the Presidency, within the framework of existing legislation, to publish an annual report in the way that the Department of Labour and various other Government Departments, for example, do indicating the activities undertaken?  Would I be right in thinking that both of those proposals could be implemented within the framework of existing legislation?  My first question, again, following on what Deputy Mitchell said was whether it would be possible by way of Government decision as distinct from legislation to make the Secretary to the President &mdash; I think his name is Mr. Brennan &mdash; directly responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts as Accounting Officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to consult about that but it would be my personal opinion that legislation would be needed to change the situation with regard to accountability.  If the Deputy so wishes I can clarify this for him subsequently.  As regards an annual report, I am sure there would be nothing to stop the President or the President's office producing one on their activities.  Perhaps this could lead to the office being even busier than it is now but I am sure that this is a matter they could consider.  I do not think there would be any difficulty about this and I presume it would be a matter for the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raised the query is that I believe that the Office of President is going to evolve &mdash; it is evolving &mdash; and that that evolution should take place within the framework of existing legislation without the need to bring in new legislation.  I anticipate tensions <Col N="405" /> in the future of an administrative kind rather than of a political kind.  All incumbents of the Office have carried out their constitutional role correctly in terms of the clear distinction between partisan and representative politics.  I do not foresee tensions in that area but I can foresee bureaucratic tensions with a more active Presidency irrespective of who the incumbent is given that we are in the process of allocating extra resources to Áras an Uachtaráin.  Unless this is followed through with a degree of administrative devolution, the dead hand of the Department of Finance, who will second guess everything, will intrude in this matter and frustrate the political will of this House to give the Presidency the resources it needs to do its job.</P>
      <P>Given that we are going to give the Presidency the sum of £100,000, does it follow through that we are not going to have officials of the Department of Finance second guessing every item of expenditure from Merrion Street?  I speak from some experience of the Department of Labour in this regard.  I welcome the reforms announced by the Minister for Finance who intends to give Government Departments a certain degree of autonomy in their day to day affairs and greater flexibility in management programmes, but my question, following on Deputy Mitchell's query on the question of the Secretary to the President, as distinct from the Secretary of the Department of Finance, being accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, is whether the Office of the Presidency will have the maximum degree of flexibility or will every item of expenditure be second guessed by the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under no circumstances will the Department of Finance be involved in deciding on or second guessing expenditure.  The President and the President's Office will have discretion and the Department of Finance will have no involvement apart from the fact that the Secretary to the President will report back to the Secretary of the Department of Finance who is the Accounting Officer <Col N="406" /> once the money has been expended. There is for and against the publication of an annual report but it is important that we do not infringe on the discretion of the President.  If the President had to produce an annual report comparisons would be made, expectations would be raised and demands made.  We must ensure that in whatever decisions are taken, above all else we do not infringe on the discretion of the President at any time.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the Bill, which has passed all Stages in Seanad Éireann, is to amend <Col N="407" /> the law relating to the pensions of the Judiciary and certain court officers, i.e. Master of the High Court, Taxing Masters and county registrars, so as to apply to the pension terms of these two groups certain limited changes in line with similar changes already introduced in the superannuation codes generally applicable throughout the public service.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill, which are broadly similar to those contained in a Bill introduced in 1984 but which lapsed with the dissolution of the 24th Dáil, are as follows.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill proposes in the case of the Judiciary that temporary service as a judge of the Circuit Court or as a district justice prior to permanent appointment will reckon for pension purposes. This change does not apply to court officers as temporary service does not arise in the case of court officers.</P>
    <P>Section 3 proposes that periods of less than a complete year, such as odd days and so on, would be included when calculating pension benefits for the Judiciary and for the court officers, respectively. At present, pensionable service is reckoned only in completed years.</P>
    <P>Section 4 proposes to give power to the Minister for Finance, after consulting with the Minister for Justice, to make regulations providing for a statutory spouses' and children's pension scheme for the Judiciary and court officers on the lines of the voluntary scheme which has been operating on an administrative basis since 1969.  The scheme, which would be self-financing, would be similar to the schemes operating already for other public service groups.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 propose to give power to the Minister for Finance, after consulting with the Minister for Justice, to make regulations, first to enable preserved pension benefits to be paid to a member of the Judiciary or a court officer, who retires voluntarily after five years' service or more, on conditions to be specified in the regulations.  The regulations will prescribe the details of a scheme for preservation of pension benefits in cases of voluntary retirement on <Col N="408" /> the lines of the scheme already operating for civil servants and, secondly, to enable a scheme for the purchase of additional years of service for pension purposes, at full cost to themselves, to be introduced for the Judiciary and the court officers&mdash; again on the lines of the scheme operating for the Civil Service.  The cost of purchasing service for pension purposes will be worked out on an actuarial basis.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the laying of regulations, when made under sections 4 and 5 of this Bill, before the House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 propose to abolish the qualifying period of service, five years, at present required to enable a death gratuity to be paid in respect of a member of the Judiciary or a court officer who dies in service.</P>
    <P>Provision is made at section 10 for an element of retrospection in applying some of these changes.  The dates applied are broadly related to the dates of implementation approved in the application of similar changes for the Civil Service and for other groups in the public service.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention in this Bill to make any fundamental changes in the pension terms of the Judiciary.  The proposed changes represent the application to the Judiciary and the court officers of quite specific changes which were introduced for the Civil Service as long ago as 1973 and which have long since been extended to other groups.  These particular matters have been the subject of representations to my Department from the Judiciary and the court officers over a period of years and previous administrations also have been committed to their implementation.</P>
    <P>The statutory provisions governing pension benefits for the Judiciary and the court officers are contained in the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, and the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>The Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, contains the basic provisions relating to pension entitlements.  Those for the Judiciary are laid down in the Second Schedule to that Act.  It provides <Col N="409" /> for a maximum pension of two-thirds remuneration, but this is subject to a reduction of one quarter &mdash; I will come back to that.  Pension is based on, in the case of judges of the Supreme and High Courts and the Circuit Court, 15 years' service, and, in the case of district justices, 20 years' service.  There is also provision for proportionate pension in cases of vacation of office on grounds of age or infirmity.  The provisions for the court officers are at section 57 of the Act.  They provide for a maximum pension of two-thirds of remuneration based on 20 years' service and, also, for a proportionate pension.  The pension terms for the court officers are very similar to, though not identical in all respects with, those for district justices.</P>
    <P>The Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for a reduction of the pension by one quarter, for example in the case of maximum pension, from two thirds to one half remuneration, and, consequentially, for payment of a retirement gratuity equal to one and a half times the pension as reduced.  It also provides, in the case of death in service, a death gratuity equal to one year's remuneration at the time of death.  Payment of the death gratuity, however, is at present subject to a statutory qualifying period of five years' service.</P>
    <P>I should now like to come back to the changes proposed.  The principle of having full-time temporary service reckonable for superannuation purposes was conceded in the Civil Service as far back as 1967.  Temporary service in the case of the Judiciary arises under section 14 and section 51 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  Section 14 provides, where it is necessary to prevent the work of the court getting into arrear, for the appointment of one or more persons to act as a judge or judges of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Section 51 makes similar provision in relation to the District Court.  In both cases persons thus appointed on a temporary basis are required to have the same qualifications as for a permanent appointee, and, during the period for which they are appointed, have all the <Col N="410" /> privileges, powers and duties of permanent judge or justice.  Circuit Court judges and district justices are frequently appointed on a temporary basis prior to being given a permanent appointment, but such temporary appointments may be renewed.  It is anomalous in these circumstances that a judge or justice who does not qualify for a full pension and who may have as much as two or more years' temporary service in addition to his permanent service should be deprived of the benefit of that temporary service for pension purposes.  Section 2 proposes to rectify this anomaly.</P>
    <P>At present, the concept of &ldquo;service&rdquo; for pension purposes is, in the cases of both the Judiciary and the court officers, reckoned by reference to completed years only.  In the Civil Service, and elsewhere, for many years now, service is reckoned on the basis of years and days, so that any period of less than a year is taken into account.</P>
    <P>In the course of my Second Stage speech in the Seanad I gave an illustration which would be worth repeating for the benefit of Members of this House, of the extent to which the superannuation benefits of a member of the Judiciary or a court officer can be adversely affected by the present arrangements.  A member of the Judiciary retired with total service of 13 years and 362 days.  His temporary service accounted for 115 days.  These did not reckon for pension.  He also did not get credit for the remaining 247 &ldquo;odd&rdquo; days.  Accordingly, his pensionable service was taken as 13 years only, thus reducing the value of the superannuation award by some 7 per cent.  The proposals at section 3 allow for the reckoning of service in years and days.  These, when combined with the proposals contained at section 2, with respect to temporary service, would serve to resolve this situation.</P>
    <P>The formal spouses' and children's pension schemes to be set up under regulations made by the Minister for Finance under section 4 would be self-financing. Benefit would be in consideration of the payment by the member of the appropriate contributions by periodic reduction <Col N="411" /> from salary and, in certain situations, by a reduction in the amount of the gratuity payable on retirement or death.  The scheme, which would have retrospective effect, would be on the lines of the informal voluntary scheme which has been operating on an administrative basis since 1969 and similar to that operating already for other public service groups.  Basically, the scheme provides that in the event of death in office of a contributor a pension becomes payable to the deceased's spouse and children based on the number of years' service the deceased would have given, had he survived to normal retirement age.  It also provides for payment of a pension on the death, subsequent to retirement, of a person who was a contributing member while in office.  A deduction is made from the lump sum of appropriate contributions for any notional years' service and for any years for which no contribution had been made, for example during temporary service. For all persons appointed to office subsequent to the making of the regulations membership will be compulsory.</P>
    <P>The proposals at section 5 are designed to enable the Minister for Finance to introduce regulations to do two things. The first is to enable pension benefits, in the case of a member of the Judiciary or a court officer who retires voluntarily with at least five years' service, to be preserved and brought into payment on demand when he reaches the appropriate age.  The second will allow members of the Judiciary and the court officers, if they wish to do so, to purchase added years of service for pension purposes at full cost to themselves.  The cost of purchasing additional service will be determined on an actuarial basis.  Section 5 provides also that regulations made thereunder may have retrospective effect.</P>
    <P>Determination of retirement age is dealt with in section 6.  Preserved benefits would be payable in no case earlier than at age 65 except in the case of death or permanent disability.  In the case of High Court judges, the age could be anywhere between 65 and 72, in the case of Circuit <Col N="412" /> Court judges between 65 and 70, and in the case of district justices and court officers, at age 65.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the laying of regulations, when made under sections 4 and 5 of this Bill, before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Subsection (1) is confined to judicial regulations and, in accordance with normal practice, does not provide for power of annulment.  The provisions at subsection (2), which will apply to court officers regulations, are the usual ones requiring that regulations be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days during which they can be annulled by a resolution of either House.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 propose, in relation to the Judiciary and the court officers respectively, that the qualifying period of five years' service necessary to enable the grant of a death gratuity in cases of death in service, be abolished.  The qualifying period of service for payment of a death gratuity was abolished on an administrative basis in the Civil Service with effect from 1 June 1973.  A similar change was not practicable, at that time, for the Judiciary.  In view of hardship caused by this it was decided to have this change applied in the case of the Judiciary with retrospective effect to 1 July 1973.  No retrospection is called for in applying this change to the court officers.</P>
    <P>I will be proposing on Committee Stage a number of amendments designed to alleviate the hardship which occurs where a person appointed to act as a temporary Circuit Court judge or as a temporary justice of the District Court, under sections 14 and 51, respectively, of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, dies before receiving a permanent appointment.</P>
    <P>Sadly, within the past year or so, two justices of the District Court died within a period of being appointed in a temporary capacity.  Had their appointment been of a permanent nature their spouses would have received a death gratuity under section 2 of the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961, as amended by section 8 of this Act.  Also, they would have been eligible for membership of the contributory spouses' and children's pension scheme and their <Col N="413" /> widows and eligible children would have benefited accordingly.  Therefore, I consider it desirable to make legislative provision to cover these cases, and similar cases in the future.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that this short Bill seeks to do no more than extend to the pension terms of the Judiciary and the court officers certain limited changes already introduced in the superannuation codes generally applicable throughout the public service.  Accordingly, I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>That is a pity.  It could be dealt with fairly quickly but it is not my prerogative to bring that about.  Section 2, which allows temporary service as reckonable for pension purposes, was agreed with members of the public service as far back as 1967.  I have no objection to it.  Section 3 allows for part of a year of service to be reckoned for pension. That was agreed for the general public service in 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 (a) provides for a contributory pension scheme for the spouses and children of judges and court officers.  Is that section applicable where the judge <Col N="414" /> is female?  I understand that the law in that area in general is not in good shape. I assume that this would be subject to the provisions of other legislation and that female judges would be in a different category.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with this point when replying.  PAYE contributors can be in very difficult circumstances following the death of a wife who has been in permanent employment for years.  If the husband and family are not covered by the widows and orphans scheme, the husband does not receive a pension.  I assume that will be rectified.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Bill are equitable and in so far as they allow members of the Judiciary the same conditions that apply in the broader public service, I accept the Bill fully.  This should have been done years ago.  I understand a promise was given by a former Taoiseach to a member of the Judiciary in particular circumstances quite a number of years ago and he has been patiently awaiting a resolution.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that during the past year the death occurred of two members of the Judiciary who were temporarily employed and their families were not entitled to pension rights.  This is entirely unsatisfactory.  The Minister will be proposing amendments to rectify that.</P>
    <P>I hope the Chair will permit me to refer to the broader areas of the Minister's responsibilities.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party have no difficulty with the general approach of seeking to equalise and harmonise the provisions in law with regard to pensions generally for those who work in the public service.  Equally, we have nothing but the highest regard for members of the Judiciary, their independence and the excellent work they do on our behalf.  We are very fortunate to have such a committed, independent and <Col N="416" /> hard working body of men and too few women working in this area as judges.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is that in the context of such praise for the Judiciary we are being asked to address what is in fact outrageous legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Cotter's contribution to this debate.  I hope he is successful with this portfolio.  It is unfortunate for him that he has been given the hard job of trying to address this legislation because, frankly, more senior spokespersons in his party have run away from it.  He has been asked to come in to this House to defend the indefensible.</P>
      <P>This is extraordinary legislation not alone with regard to its content but more particularly its origins.  I will remind the House that this legislation was first produced by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government in December 1984.  That Government let it sit for the next three years without making any progress whatsoever, for reasons that Deputy Cotter cannot or will not tell us and there is no member from the Labour Party present to illuminate us as to why this &ldquo;non contentious&rdquo; legislation, the words Deputy Cotter used, could not progress one iota during the three years of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government from 1984-87.  The legislation lapsed with the fall of that Government in 1987, was reintroduced by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government in 1990 but was subsequently withdrawn for some odd reason and we now see the republished document before us today. The Minister offered no explanation as to why the Bill was taken on board by the Government they not being party to any of the discussions that took place in 1984; or why the original Bill as published and circulated was withdrawn and this new document is now before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to determine precisely the impact of the legislation.  The explanatory memorandum is vague in the extreme and the Minister's speech was somewhat uninformative.  It mirrors what he said in the Seanad debate.  Deputy Cotter, and I am sure the Minister, would have hoped that today's debate would <Col N="417" /> have been on the same lines.  However, if I can do anything I hope to upset that smug and cosy arrangement.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, when he was Opposition spokesperson in 1984 made the point that the Bill did not have an explanatory memorandum. When he complained about it, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, told him that the Bill was so self-explanatory that it did not need an explanatory memorandum.  The implications of the legislation seem to have been missed entirely during the debate in the Seanad and are being trivialised in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that the legislation does no more than bring the law in this area with regard to members of the Judiciary into line with the position in the public service generally.  That may be so in respect of sections 2, 3 and 4 and we have no difficulty with the principle of harmonising provisions for the Judiciary and bringing them into line with the public service.  However, in fundamental ways, the legislation goes beyond this, particularly the provisions relating to retrospection, which I will deal with later. The implication of the retrospective provisions potentially and real represent a vastly different scenario.  In fact the then deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Brian Lenihan, had the following to say in 1984:</P>
    <P>In this time of economic crisis it is nothing short of insanity to introduce a five years pension qualification for judges &mdash; especially when one of the first beneficiaries is a former Fine Gael Minister and present Chief Justice whom it is now proposed to send on a further salary and pension hike to the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>That was the response of Deputy Lenihan to a similar proposal.  This House deserves some explanation on this.  Is the Minister for Justice suggesting that the economic crisis of 1984, which Deputy Lenihan was so conscious of, has disappeared? Is the Minister trying to suggest that the lot of the unemployed, those who are living in poverty &mdash; the numbers have increased &mdash; and those in receipt of <Col N="418" /> social welfare who proportionately are no better off than they were in 1984, has changed to such an extent that we can be asked to deal with this extraordinary legislation to commit, as Deputy Lenihan said in 1984, &ldquo;this act of insanity&rdquo;.  What has changed?  Why have Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats taken on board legislation which was correctly dismissed by the then Leader of Fianna Fáil only a short few years ago?</P>
    <P>This morning I asked the Taoiseach when we could expect the legislative proposals in response to the Martin Commission which published a report in March of last year.  Shortly after the publication of the report he was looking at the proposals as a matter of urgency with a view to bringing forward legislation. This morning the Taoiseach told us that there was such a queue of legislation that it was not likely that that Bill would be published let alone debated in this House in the next three months, yet we can find time in the queue of urgent pressing legislation to deal with this Bill today.  If I interpret what has been said, it is Deputy Cotter's desire that all Stages be dealt with and that the legislation be nodded through without question.  It is extraordinary that when there are important issues to be dealt with and outstanding commitments of a year or more from the Minister on his own portfolio, let alone all the other promised legislation, we can find time to deal with this legislation so conveniently and easily and that the so-called Opposition Party suggest it is non-contentious legislation which can be put through on the nod.</P>
    <P>The Minister said during the Seanad debate that this Bill was broadly similar to that introduced by the Government of 1984.  Let me repeat that it is worth remembering what the Fianna Fáil Party had to say about it and I have quoted Deputy Lenihan already.  What has happened since 1984 to bring about such a dramatic change in attitude on the part of Fianna Fáil?  Are they suggesting there is now no economic crisis?  Have they decided that it is now acceptable to introduce a five year pension qualification for <Col N="419" /> judges?  As I said we are entitled to an explanation on this.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to suggest that the provisions of this Bill are designed to bring the pension arrangements of judges into line with arrangements already in force for most other groups in the public service.  That is true with regard to some of its provisions, many of which are non-controversial. Under the provisions of this Bill a judge, who has served a minimum of five years, will be able to have his or her pension rights preserved until reaching retirement age.  It is true that this arrangement is now available to most other workers following the enactment of the Pensions Act last year, but there is a major difference between the provisions of this Bill and the Pensions Act.</P>
    <P>In the treatment of judges and other public sector workers the difference is that the provisions of this Bill are being backdated on a scale I have never observed before in this House.  For example, sections 2 and 3 come into effect from 1 August 1978 and section 8 would appear to come into effect from 1 June 1973, almost 20 years earlier.  Even more extraordinary, the regulations the Minister will make under section 4 and the controversial section 5 shall come into effect &ldquo;on a date prior to the date on which they are made&rdquo;.  Presumably if the Minister wanted, he could decide that the regulations would come into effect from the date of the establishment of this State.  This is special legislation for the privileged élite and must be opposed.</P>
    <P>Prior to the enactment of the Pensions Act many public sector workers were in a position similar to that of judges, that is, if they left employment to take up a better paid position they forfeited their pension rights.  That was very severe on them, but when the Pensions Bill was going through the Dáil, there was no question of backdating its provisions to 1978, 1973 or any other earlier date; its beneficiaries lost and had to endure that loss.  Why should some of our most senior judges, who earn substantial amounts of money, be treated in a different manner? This difference of treatment gave rise <Col N="420" /> to much reaction within the trade union movement in 1984.  I should like to quote briefly what some of them had to say about it.  As reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 13 December 1984 the then Secretary of the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs said he was astounded by the proposals.  He said his members had to work 40 years to qualify for a pension and it was scandalous that the Government, which pleaded inability to pay its own public service workers, could now find the money to pay handsome pensions to their friends in the Judiciary.  The then General Secretary of the Irish Municipal Employees Trade Union was quoted as saying the decision was outrageous, that his members averaged £130 a week and those in Dublin Corporation had been offered a pay increase of £7 a week over 19 months; yet the Government were proposing to pay pensions to the Judiciary after only five years service.  He said some members of the Judiciary already qualified for pensions in excess of what his members were earnings for a week's work.  The then General Secretary of the National Busworkers' Union &mdash; a man due to retire shortly whom I wish well &mdash; described the provisions of the then Bill as absolutely scandalous.  He is quoted as saying it would only encourage his members to fight on for improved pensions and wages.</P>
    <P>I wonder where is the trade union movement today?  For example, is their silence in the face of this Bill a result of the gagging of the trade union movement during the negotiations that took place on the recent <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress?</i> In the course of those negotiations, I wonder whether they were reminded that these very provisions were in the offing on the part of Government and, hopefully, would be nodded through this House if the Fine Gael Party and the Minister had their way without any controversial debate? For example, I wonder whether the very wide ranging implications of this Bill were brought to their attention and debated by them.  I do not perceive any change in <Col N="421" /> economic circumstances, I do not perceive any change in any conditions prevailing since 1984, if anything, they have deteriorated.  I believe that the remarks of the then various union leaders are as appropriate now to the provisions of this Bill.  I am surprised that the provisions of this Bill were not drawn to their attention in the process of negotiating that recent programme.  Perhaps that is the reason there is not the same reaction now.</P>
    <P>An interesting omission from the Minister's introductory remarks today &mdash; alluded to by Deputy Cotter and mentioned by the Minister in the Seanad &mdash; is any explanation for the more extraordinary provisions of this Bill being included on two grounds.  The first was that the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, had given a commitment to a senior member of the Judiciary then contemplating departing to a job in the European Courts of Justice.  The first point to be made about that is that there was some perceived idea that the person particular to that arrangement, in going to the European Courts of Justice, in some way was making a personal sacrifice or one on our behalf, which is far from being the truth.  Indeed the scale of pay, the perquisites, the supports and facilities available to the person in question were increased enormously so that any notion of sacrifice was more than adequately covered by those increased facilities.</P>
    <P>The other point made by the Minister in the Seanad was that there was legal action pending.  None of this has been explained in the Minister's introductory remarks in the House today.  Perhaps he might be prompted to deal with these matters because this House warrants such explanation.  For example, was the arrangement between the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, a personal one or were the Government of the day party to it?  Are we to understand that, because some cajoling discussion took place between the then Taoiseach and the individual in question, we must now legislate, or was this a matter which was discussed and agreed in Cabinet?  I doubt if it were the latter because the legislation, for some extraordinary <Col N="422" /> reason, while being introduced on foot of that undertaking, could not be progressed one jot in the three years available to the then Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The other issue that arises here is must we legislate every time someone threatens legal action?  Government performance in this respect clearly demonstrates quite the opposite.  For example, in the area of welfare entitlements, akin to pensions, in respect of which the Irish Government have been brought to the European Court they have been found wanting in regard to equality provisions, they have been found to be in breach of the law of Europe.  Clearly it will be seen that the Government cannot even respond, not when they are being threatened with legal action.  Even when they have been brought to court and found wanting, they are not prepared to respond.  One must ask why.  The answer is that it is not a collection of judges or one judge who has been inconvenienced or found to be in need but rather because ordinary citizens who should have been properly paid under the social welfare code have not been.</P>
    <P>There is no movement on the part of Government to ensure that those who were entitled to proper payments under the equality provisions of the social welfare code are accommodated.  Rather this Bill was introduced because of some discussion, some chat, some cajoling pressures having been brought to bear on the then Chief Justice to take up an enormously well remunerated position in Europe which, when one examines the relevant figures, will put its provisions in proper context.  Because of that these Houses have been assembled to nod through some cosy Bill to accommodate discussions which took place then.  We have not been told about them.  The Seanad was told in passing by the Minister, when introducing the Bill there, but nobody there was prepared to inquire what had been going on.</P>
    <P>The contributor in the Seanad, on behalf of the Fine Gael group there, responded very much in the same way as Deputy Cotter has done here today.  A simple straightforward Bill was how the Leader of the Seanad group described <Col N="423" /> this legislation when dealing with it last month.  It is anything but simple in its conception and in its inception.  It is certainly not straightforward for those many thousands of people out there who are now being told that if they want to get anything approaching equity under the social welfare code they must go to litigation. They are wondering why the Seanad and the Dáil can assemble and hopefully nod through provisions, which were described by Fianna Fáil in 1984 when they were first produced as verging on insanity by Deputy Brian Lenihan, that have been condemned out of hand by all the major trade union leaders representing workers saying that they are scandalous, unacceptable and unfair. This is an extraordinary day in the life of this legislative Chamber and we will all stand condemned for the way in which we are seeking to abuse our authority with this legislation and suggesting that things can be nodded through and that matters are straightforward and simple and not controversial when they are otherwise.</P>
    <P>I demand to know on behalf of everyone outside who will want information about this legislation, what was the nature of the discussions that took place between the then Taoiseach and the then Chief Justice?  Were they a matter of Cabinet?  Were they agreed to at any level or was it just some cosy discussion between a current member of Fine Gael and a former Fine Gael Deputy in this House as he departed to a very cosy appointment at the European Court?  We have a right to know what those discussions were about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will satisfy the record of the House now by reminding Members of the words of the Minister on Second Stage in the Seanad, Official Report volume 128, No. 2 of Thursday, 14 March 1991 at column 128, when he said:</P>
      <P>The Bill, which is broadly similar to one which was introduced in 1984 but which lapsed with the dissolution of the 24th Dáil, would honour a commitment made by the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, to a Member of the Judiciary who vacated office for the purpose of taking up a position with the European Communities. The commitment has since led to threats of legal action if not put in place.</P>
      <P>The second point on which this House deserves some explanation if we are to legislate and put into place this legislation &mdash; which I hope we will not &mdash; is what are those threats of legal action all about? From whom are they emanating?  What form do they take?  Has correspondence been issued and to what extent has the litigation been progressed?  I accept that if we are found wanting and if the Government have a commitment of Cabinet or otherwise enforceable by a member of the Judiciary or anyone, it is proper that that litigation be compromised, that matters be settled and, if necessary, if legislation is required, it is proper that we should be here.</P>
      <P>However, we deserve to know the extent of the threat, how likely it is to succeed or is it just a bit of bluster and bluff arising from some cosy discussion between the former Taoiseach and the Chief Justice which would be utterly unenforceable at law?  If we are asked to legislate and this is what the Seanad was told &mdash; we have not been told, although Deputy Cotter mentioned it &mdash; we have a right to know and I would ask the Minister to elaborate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> The Minister also suggested that there is the threat of legal action if the commitment allegedly given by the former Taoiseach was not acted on.  Is the Dáil now to legislate on each occasion on which legal action is threatened?  When injustices have been highlighted in the social welfare code the Government have never legislated under the threat of legal action.  On the other hand they have fought every legal attempt to reform the social welfare code through the courts of this country and often into the European courts.  Again, some of the wealthiest and most privileged legal big wigs are being afforded special treatment and we should know the reason.</P>
    <P>The next question that must be answered in the course of this debate is the cost to the Exchequer of this legislation. I have searched in vain through the explanatory memorandum and cannot find any mention of the cost.  The Minister made no reference to it in his contribution.  On every occasion on which the social welfare recipients on the other hand receive a few extra bob we are told from time to time the great cost to the State, but why are we not told this kind of information in the context of this legislation? It is simple straightforward legislation, non-controversial so far as the major parties in the House are concerned but those of us who have a different view of the matter are concerned.</P>
    <P>The newspaper reports published in 1984 identified the main beneficiary under this legislation as the former Chief Justice, Mr. Thomas F. O'Higgins, who left this position to take up what was presumably a much better paid post in the European Court.  Can the Minister inform us of the salary level paid to Judge O'Higgins in his present position and what his pension from Europe will be? According to my estimates, and those published in 1984, he will benefit from a judicial pension approaching £30,000 per year &mdash; now it will be more because of increments in the meantime &mdash; this, backdated, as promised under the provisions of the legislation, will offer the recipient, the person central to this whole issue, something in the order of a minimum of <Col N="426" /> £250,000 lump sum on his retirement. That is what we are legislating for.  That is why Deputy Lenihan described this legislation as an act of insanity in 1984 and it has not changed.  If anything the degree and level of insanity, if there is such a thing, is growing because the amount of money to be paid is growing. Nonetheless, in this area not only do you have to add to the £250,000 lump sum which the person will receive, but to add his pension from his position in the European judicial post which he now holds and his Dáil pension, which at present stands at £14,500 per year.  Can the Dáil be generous to those who really need it? It is nice to know that the distinguished former judge will never have to use his bus pass or to trudge down to his local sub-post office &mdash; if it has not been closed in the meantime &mdash; to collect his old age pension.  The scale of the figures we are talking about here are staggering and are unacceptable if not immoral.  The scale of what the Minister proposes to pay to the particular individual, unfortunately brought into the centre of this legislation because it is his position that has prompted the legislation in the first place, helps to illustrate how grossly out of line and how grossly unjust the legislation, once operated, particularly in regard to the retrospective proposals, will be.  This House must stop and think again before we accept this legislation in its entirety. The Bill is an outrage and an insult to those who have been told repeatedly by this Government and by previous administrations that there is no more money for social welfare, that health cuts must go ahead, and to those whose communities are collapsing because of the lack of spending on facilities.  I should like to say very succinctly that The Workers' Party will not co-operate with any smug arrangement by the other parties to nod this Bill through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party feel that this is a minor and routine Bill and in that respect we are prepared to support Second Stage.  There is no reason why persons who have served with distinction in the courts over a long period should <Col N="427" /> be discriminated against by technicalities in the matter of their pensions and pension entitlements.  However, as the Bill is designed to remove such anomalies and promote fairer treatment for public servants we say very clearly that it is relevant.</P>
      <P>Sections 5 and 6 propose to give power to the Minister for Finance, after consulation with the Minister for Justice, to make regulations to enable pension benefits to be paid to a member of the Judiciary or a court officer who retires voluntarily after five years' service or more.  This concerns us.  If we look at the population at large we will realise that many workers in the public and private sectors who have given 30 or 40 years' service receive no pension on retirement. People in semi-State organisations who have worked for 30 years, perhaps from the age of 20, and may have to leave either due to sickness or on early retirement before they reach the age of 55 are not entitled to a pension.</P>
      <P>The 250,000 people unemployed here find it very difficult to raise their families on the money they receive.  Working people who are just over the income limit for a medical card also find it very difficult to live on their income.  It is almost impossible to get legislation enacted in this House to provide the necessary services for these people and give them a normal standard of living.  We have talked about the Irish Shipping workers and dealt with their problems over the years.  Those workers protested outside the Dáil and in the Gallery here in order to get the Government to enact legislation that would give them justice and equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation proposes to give pensions to people who retire voluntarily after five years' service.  It is this issue that concerned us.  The Bill, as drafted, provides for additional pensions for senior lawyers who may already have a substantial income by way of pension.  I am not saying that those people, on the basis of their qualifications, service to the country and so on are not entitled to <Col N="428" /> a proper salary but, without wishing to personalise this matter, it appears from the debate in the Seanad in 1984 that the Bill provides for a substantial pension to a person who receives a pension already as a former Member of the Dáil in addition to a pension as a former member of Government and, in all probability, a pension as a retiring member of the European Court of Justice.  I have no idea what all these pensions add up to but I imagine the income involved is quite considerable.  When people who are finding it difficult to exist hear this debate they may ask how relevant is Dáil Éireann to their needs or how relevant is this legislation.  They may wonder why when a problem arises for them legislation cannot be pushed through to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party accept that a reasonable case has been made for increasing the income of the people involved. Accordingly, on behalf of the Labour Party I am serving notice that while we do not object to this Bill on Second Stage we want to see it amended to ensure that there is an abatement of pension entitlements in the case of persons who already enjoy a substantial income from the State whether in terms of pension or from any other source.  Legislation enacted should be fair and the people in need should also be considered.  There are many groups who would say they are forgotten about.  When problems arise for people with power and people who are financially well off legislation can be put through very quickly to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>Nobody in the community could object to reasonable pensions being paid to public servants who have carried out their duties over many years, but the point will reasonably be made by many people that the same sense of urgency does not prevail in ensuring that widows, elderly people and those on small and, in many cases, fixed pensions are as well treated. That is the kernel of this legislation.  From our point of view there is no equality in this area.  There is certainly no case for supporting the granting of very large index-linked pensions to boost the <Col N="429" /> incomes of people who are already very well off.  That is the bottom line.  The Labour Party want the Bill amended on Committee Stage because at the end of the day justice will have to be seen to be done.  While saying that in general terms the Bill is a minor and routine one, at the end of the day we are talking about general principles, principles of equality and justice, and this legislation does not treat all people equally.  It is on that basis that we put down our market at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I really want to speak about the sympathy that I &mdash; and most people &mdash; have for those in temporary positions.  I welcome the fact that the position of justices and court officers in temporary positions who are not entitled to full pension will be regularised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a Deputy for over 15 years and before that I was a Member of the Seanad.  During that time I met many people, particularly in the teaching profession, who had temporary service and did not get their full entitlements when they reached retirement age.  Why do the Government not bring in legislation to cover people in this situation?  The first sentence of the explanatory memorandum says that the purpose of the Bill is to extend to members of the Judiciary and specific court officers certain pension benefits which are already available to most other groups in the public service. I am glad that the memorandum refers to &ldquo;most other groups&rdquo; but we should identify the groups which do not get the full pension benefits to which they are entitled.  Temporary service is no use to a person unless he or she is made permanent before reaching retirement age. As I understand it, a temporary worker can buy service or, under a complicated system, can buy notional service. However, you cannot do that until you become permanent and this is one of the problems that many people are facing. Why do we not have a Bill to deal with the pension benefits of junior doctors? The same applies to student nurses and <Col N="430" /> substitute teachers; there is a very serious case to answer in that regard.  This Bill deals with members of the Judiciary and specific court officers and I welcome the fact that their position will be regularised but we should not forget people in other professions who, for one reason or another, have temporary service.</P>
    <P>There are pension schemes covering local authorities, the Civil Service and the Oireachtas and they have all been discussed from time to time.  There is the normal 5 per cent superannuation scheme and the 1.5 per cent spouse's and children's scheme which apply only when people are permanent.  If you spend your life working in a temporary position you will certainly not get the benefits.  This matter should be addressed by the Government; it is not the responsibility of the Minister for Justice to deal with the areas I mentioned. The Government must take on board this group of people who work in a temporary capacity for a long time.  I agree with Deputy McCartan that, if we bring in legislation for these other groups, it should be backdated as is the case in relation to this Bill.  The Government should identify groups of people who are losing out because they are not made permanent.</P>
    <P>It was not until 1975, when I became a Member of this House, that teachers were able to tell their boards of management that they were entitled to put in a fully qualified trained teacher.  Before that substitute teachers could be employed provided they had a leaving certificate.  Indeed, a teacher remained temporary even when replacing a Member of the Oireachtas.  Many teachers work temporarily and do not qualify for full pension benefits.</P>
    <P>Many vocational teachers did not opt for the pension schemes which were available in the past for themselves, their spouses and families.  I hope that even at this stage they could be allowed, under new legislation, to become permanent full-time teachers and that the benefits would apply to their spouses and children as envisaged for the people covered in this Bill.  While I have no difficulty with the principle of this Bill it should be <Col N="431" /> pointed out that many groups and professions feel discriminated against; many of these people expect the Government to legislate for them and to bring in the benefits to which they are entitled.  I hope that the Government will, through general legislation, cover the categories I have mentioned and other professions. In that way we will be seen not to be discriminating in favour of one profession but covering those who had been unfairly and unjustly treated in the past.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to contribute to the Bill because, as many people said, it is almost a technical Bill rectifying something that probably should have been rectified a number of years ago before the situation became so controversial.</P>
      <P>I must criticise Deputy McCartan for his implication &mdash; he did not say it in so many words &mdash; in regard to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald. He used the words &ldquo;cosy hat&rdquo;, the implication is that something untoward happened, perhaps even smacking of illegality, hints of bribery or a friendship clause.  I deny that anything of the kind happened, I was not present, of course, at the discussions which Deputy Garret FitzGerald would have had with Mr. Tom O'Higgins but the implication&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know but neither does Deputy McCartan.  The implication in regard to a very fine Deputy, who was Taoiseach for a number of years, should not go by without somebody denying it. I believe that what happened at that time was that a very senior member of the Judiciary, who had given very good service to this country, was selected to give further prestigious service on our behalf in the European Court of Justice.  A few short weeks ago I was lucky to be a member of the EC legislation committee which travelled to the Court of Justice.  I met Mr. O'Higgins there and I was really proud that an Irishman was treated with <Col N="432" /> such respect &mdash; and commanded such respect &mdash; from all his peers in all the other countries which participate in the Court of Justice.  There is no truth in the implication that Mr. O'Higgins, somehow or other, was not representing this country in the finest way possible.</P>
      <P>Deputies have pension rights after five years' service.  We are allowed to receive a pension when we reach 60 years of age after we have served for five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

      <P>That is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not wrong.  I do not see The Workers' Party giving up that right.  They may well have opposed it but they will sit here very happily and, when they have done their five, eight or 12 years' service, I have no doubt they will take their pensions.  Maybe I should not pre-empt what some of them will do but I am quite sure they will take their pensions when the time comes.  That is as it should be if that is what the system is but what I find inherently sick is Deputy McCartan's argument.  If a thing is just and equitable it is so whether the figures be large or small, and two wrongs do not make a right.  Of course there are huge injustices throughout our pension schemes for very many poor people but that is not to say that we should penalise other people because the sums of money are bigger.  Of course Mr. O'Higgins and Mr. Andreas O'Keeffe, and Mr. Justice Donal Barrington who, I believe, will also benefit from this Bill, will benefit from this Bill and from their time in Europe which they got compliments of some Government because it happened to be in the remit of a Government to make those appointments. They will benefit, and they will benefit generously, but it does not diminish the inherent justice and equity in the case of all other public servants that judges and justices should get the benefit themselves or that their widows and dependants should get it.  Why should they be penalised because of some sort of ideological hang up on the part of The Workers' Party that because one is earning a certain amount of money one should not in turn get one's just rewards <Col N="433" /> from that work?  These men and women who will serve this country abroad in these courts, the Court of Human Rights, the Court of Justice or the Court of First Instance where Mr. Donal Barrington is now serving &mdash; again I was proud to meet him there and see with what respect and honour he is viewed by his colleagues all over Europe &mdash; are entitled to their pension rights in the same form as all other public servants are entitled to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain elements of justices' rights etc. that one might query, but the appointments of men and women to these positions tend to happen in the later years of their lives and it is only right that some system be in place to allow them to be paid their pensions and to contribute to their pensions up to a certain age.  As Deputy Kitt said, there are many instances where other sections of our population and our workforce should also be getting rights like this or having their existing rights extended, but that is a different matter.  That is an area that this Minister or some future Government should be tackling, but it is not a good enough reason for imputing some kind of sleight of hand here or implying that somehow these men are getting something they are not entitled to and that they do not deserve.  I understand Mr. O'Higgins has threatened legal action. He has retired with 12 years' service and not the necessary 15 that he needed to get his pension when he would eventually reach retirement age.  That is not why this Bill is here.  I do not believe that the Bill is here only because of the threat of legal action.  I believe the Minister when he says this Bill is here to rectify an anomaly that was there.  If we want to send our best and our brightest and our most relevantly experienced people to represent us in the various institutions and fora in Europe and elsewhere it would be sad if we could not see our way to ensuring that they would not suffer because of that.  Deputy McCartan might say that it is some suffering with the kind of pensions they get. That is not the issue here.  The sense of justice that is being brought in in this Bill is the same whether we are talking about <Col N="434" /> somebody on a salary of £10,000 a year or £100,000 a year.  It is a matter of equity and justice.  I am surprised that The Workers' Party who purport to represent people in an equitable and just way find it so difficult just because the figures are so big.  I remember reading a few years ago that the same Deputy McCartan had earned a very vast sum of money from the free legal aid system.  That was written up in the papers, but nobody denied him the right to do that.  He was doing a job.  He was also a public representative and he was running a legal practice.  It was his entitlement to earn that and nobody said that he should not get that money.  We have to be equitable and fair in the system.  Of course there are other things that this Minister and others can do.  I was moved to anger by the implication against Dr. Garret FitzGerald, against Mr. O'Higgins and against the Fine Gael Party, as if Mr. O'Higgins was the only beneficiary.  I hope the Minister will clarify that there are other men &mdash; at this stage I do not think there are any women involved &mdash; who will benefit from this and whose families, whose widows and orphans or dependants, will benefit as they are entitled to.  I think that some of the things Deputy McCartan has said should not go unanswered in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first contribution to this debate was from Deputy Cotter who was speaking for the first time as spokesman in this area on behalf of his party.  I would like to take the opportunity of wishing him well in his new role.  I hope he will have a long career in that position and I look forward to debating with him from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>He mentioned that the existing spouses' and children's pension scheme applies equally to both male and female members of the Judiciary and female court officers.  The amounts of the contributions required are the same for both males and females.  The benefits payable are also the same for both men and women.  The statutory scheme proposed in the Bill will be based on the existing administrative scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> Deputy McCartan spoke at the outset about the importance within our system of the independence of the Judiciary.  We have been served loyally and well and honourably by men and women who, since the foundation of the State, have been nominated by Government and appointed by the President to act on our behalf in the various courts.  They have upheld our Constitution and have been the bullwark of our rights and liberties as citizens and we should acknowledge that here today.  What is proposed here and which is also in the main welcomed by Deputy McCartan is the tidying up of some anomalies within their pension schemes.</P>
    <P>The Deputy then proceeded to section 5 of this Bill and asked for the background to this legislation.  The Bill is broadly similar to one which was introduced in 1984 but which lapsed with the dissolution of the 24th Dáil.  It will honour a commitment made by the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, to a member of the Judiciary who had vacated office for the purpose of taking up a position with the European Community. The commitment has since led to threats of legal action if not put in place.  I was asked by Deputy McCartan if there had been an exchange of letters from legal representatives of the former Chief Justice. Yes, there has been an exchange of letters and there has been a threat of legal action as I already outlined in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other points that were raised by Deputy McCartan they will undoubtedly be debated at some length on Committee Stage.  Specific undertakings were given in 1984 not just on behalf of the Taoiseach of the day but on behalf of the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the contribution made by Deputy Ryan on behalf of the Labour Party.  He said that there were difficulties in relation to pensions being available to people who have done 30 and 40 years work.  I share his concern in relation to that.  Obviously we all want to see a situation where there is equity in our society and where people have pension rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> If the Labour Party feel as strongly about section 5 as Deputy Ryan said they do it is a great pity they did not do something about it when they were in Government and had the power to do it.  They were members of the Government who published the 1984 Bill and gave that commitment.  Deputy Ryan also referred to the Irish Shipping workers.  This issue arose during the term of office of a Government in which the Labour Party were actively involved.  The Minister for Transport at that time was involved in making the decision which gave rise to the demise of Irish Shipping.  It is easy for Deputy Ryan to speak now from the Opposition benches about being seen to be fair and no groups being forgotten about.  However, when the Labour Party had the power to do something about these issues they failed miserably.  To be fair to Deputy McCartan, The Workers' Party had no such powerful position at that time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Kitt, as I have already said I share his concern about pension rights for other groups.  We are changing the situation as rapidly as possible.  I will bring the views he expressed so strongly here this afternoon to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and other relevant Ministers.  The Deputy also referred to education.  I will bring the concerns he expressed about the position of temporary teachers to the attention of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the points raised by Deputy Owen should more appropriately be replied to by Deputy McCartan than by me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that we will have a long and detailed debate on Committee Stage when I will answer the individual points that are made.  I look forward to having that debate at an early stage.  Many decent people have served this country well on the bench.  The families of temporary district justices who gave up their practices but who were not <Col N="437" /> made permanent have found that they have no pension rights.  These people deserve to be treated by the State in an equitable manner.  That is what this legislation is about.  This is one area of controversy and, as Deputy Owen rightly said, there will be others.  I think it is fair to say that this legislation would not have been brought forward if it were not for the threat of legal action and the commitments given in regard to that particular section.  In so far as the families and other people who will benefit from the Bill are concerned, it is only right and proper that we recognise the service given by these district justices to the State and its citizens.  I have no hesitation in recommending the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to an Agreement between the Government and the Government of the United States of America establishing a scholarship exchange scheme and to further expand the programme of academic exchanges between the two countries.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid duplicating the work of the House it is proposed to deal with the detailed provisions of the Agreement in conjunction with the Committee Stage of this Bill, and a motion for the approval of the terms of the Agreement will be tabled at that time.</P>
    <P>The new Agreement, which was signed in Dublin on 27 October 1988, arose from a commitment by former President Reagan during his visit to Ireland in 1984 to increase the level of academic exchanges between Ireland and the United States and to allocate additional American funding for this purpose under the Fulbright-Hays Act of the United States Congress.</P>
    <P>At present, academic exchanges between the United States and Ireland are administered by the Scholarship Exchange Board and financed by income from the Scholarship Exchange Fund, both of which were set up under the Scholarship Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1957.</P>
    <P>The Scholarship Exchange Board have performed their task excellently and I should like to take this opportunity to thank and to pay a warm tribute to its members &mdash; American and Irish, past and present &mdash; for their work over the years.</P>
    <P>However, in order to avail of the additional Fulbright funds now offered by the United States, it is necessary to replace the Scholarship Exchange Board and Fund by, respectively, a new Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange and a new Ireland-United States Educational Fund, along the lines of the bi-national Fulbright structures which operate in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Agreement of 1988 states that a commission to be known as the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange shall be established to <Col N="439" /> replace An Bord Scoláireachtaí Comhalairte, the Scholarship Exchange Board, which was appointed pursuant to section 2 of the Scholarship Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1957.  Section 2 (ii) of the Bill before the House provides for the establishment of this new commission.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange will be to increase educational exchanges, which are such important agents of cultural interchange, between our countries.  The functions of the new commission will be to encourage studies, research, instruction and other educational activities for the benefit of citizens of both countries; to develop and encourage exchanges of students, research scholars and teachers; and to encourage other related educational and cultural programmes and activities.</P>
    <P>The commission will be larger and more autonomous in management and administration than the Scholarship Exchange Board.  The board consists of seven members, four appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and three by the United States Ambassador to Ireland.  The chairman of the board is appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs who also provides the board's secretariat and accommodation.</P>
    <P>The new commission will have eight members, four appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and four by the United States Ambassador.  The present chairman of the Scholarship Exchange Board will serve as the first chairman of the commission for a two year term of office.  Thereafter the chairman will be elected by commission members.  Other office holders such as the deputy chairman, treasurer and assistant treasurer will be elected at the first meeting of the new commission from among its members.  The commission will be empowered to provide their own accommodation and secretariat, by acquiring property and engaging an executive director and administrative staff.</P>
    <P>Detailed provisions are set out in sections 8 to 14 of the Bill before the House <Col N="440" /> with regard to the new commission's obligations, commitments and expenditure as well as meetings and procedures, staff and expenses.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange will be financed by income from the Ireland-United States Educational Fund.  This new fund will replace the scholarship exchange fund established under section 6 (2) of the 1957 Act. The scholarship exchange fund was set up with a capital sum of £500,000 from the American Grant Counterpart Special Account established pursuant to the 1948 Economic Co-operation Agreement between Ireland and the United States. Upon the winding up of the scholarship exchange fund the moneys available will be transferred to the credit of the Ireland-United States Educational Fund.  In addition, the commission will receive direct funding from the United States.  In this regard, since the 1984 announcement, and pending the establishment of the new commission, an annual sum in the region of US$127,000 has been provided by the United States and administered on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by the Scholarship Exchange Board.  This allocation is expected to be increased once the commission has been established.</P>
    <P>In commending this Bill to the House I am conscious of the invaluable opportunities which the scholarship exchange scheme with the United States has provided our brightest and most creative scholars in a wide variety of academic disciplines over the years by assisting them to further develop and extend their expertise in their chosen fields.  However, beyond the considerable professional and personal benefit that a Fulbright award brings to the individual, the facilities accorded some of our most gifted young scholars to enable them to undertake research work in universities in the United States has been of substantial benefit to Ireland.  A significant number of those awarded Fulbright fellowships have returned to our universities, to industry or to the public service with horizons broadened and experiences gained <Col N="441" /> that have redounded to the overall benefit of the country down through the years. In addition, the work of our own universities and third level institutions has been immensely enriched by incoming American scholars who have taught and carried out research in Ireland in a broad range of fields.</P>
    <P>The Fulbright programme, under which the scholarship exchange scheme was organised and within which it is now planned to further develop academic exchanges, was perhaps one of the most enlightened initiatives undertaken with the aim of fostering international relations. Today, some 45 years after its introduction, this programme of binational educational links between the United States and approximately 120 countries has produced a unique international network of intellectual co-operation based on academic exchange. More than 160,000 leading figures in Government, the information media, the arts and the academic community from all over the world have shared the experience of having been &ldquo;Fulbrighters&rdquo; and the resulting benefits to educational and public life around the globe are difficult to measure.</P>
    <P>Ireland is privileged to have been able to participate in this programme from an early date, and to have the possibility now by virtue of the additional funding being provided by the United States, to further develop academic exchanges between our two countries.  I am confident that, by enabling Ireland to avail of the opportunity for increased co-operation and exchanges in this area, the Bill before the House will not only be of immense benefit to individual scholars but will make a significant and positive contribution to the development of our universities and to the country as a whole in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I warmly welcome the introduction of this Bill with one small criticism, that it has taken since October 1988 until now to bring it before the House.  Following President Reagan's visit here in 1984, a <Col N="442" /> further commitment was given to extend this scholarship exchange programme between Ireland and the United States, with the additional possibility of money being given by the United States.  Discussions were entered into and agreement was finally reached in October 1988.  The Bill should probably have been here before this.  It has not held up the work of the exchange programme but the exchange programme needed this statutory move to formalise the informal agreements that existed.</P>
      <P>This whole programme originated when I was a small child in 1948, post-World War II.  The American Government donated to this country approximately US$18 million or £6 million sterling, at that time to help build Ireland and give us an opportunity to develop infrastructure and so on.  Around 1957 or a little earlier it was decided that out of this American Grant Counterpart Fund, which was the name of this fund, £500,000 would be taken and invested and allocated especially to create this kind of scholarship exchange to allow a flow of Irish academics and post-graduate students to go to the US and learn and to allow similar qualified people to come to Ireland from the US and to develop our structures and to learn.  There is a great deal we can learn from each other's cultures &mdash; the American more modern culture which is perhaps more technology oriented and the rich Irish culture in literature and the arts.  So started this Ireland-United States Scholarship Exchange Fund.  Over the years a great number of our best and brightest have benefited from this.  It is not an elitist thing, although one must have a first class degree to qualify.  Perhaps in our midst we may have a &ldquo;Fulbrighter&rdquo;.  We certainly have some of our brightest academics in this House.  Unfortunately, I cannot include myself in that list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1957 the money has been invested by successive Ministers for Finance and the interest from that first investment has been used over the years to fund the students and academics.  In the original Act the board was very much an animal of the Department of Foreign <Col N="443" /> Affairs.  I pay tribute here to the secretariat of the Department of Foreign Affairs who ran the operations of this board over the years.  There was not much autonomy attached to the operations of the board.  They were not allowed have their own secretariat or their own property or offices.  It was through the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs that the exchange programme operated although an independent board with four members from Ireland and three from the US were appointed.  I did not manage in my research to find out why there were four from Ireland and three from the US, seeing that the lion's share of the money came from the US.  I am glad to see that this Bill has restored the balance and that there are now four members from the US and four from Ireland.</P>
    <P>Although the operation of the exchange programme has not impinged on my life, I know of it and that the current chairman, Mr. Joe Lee, is a very eminent academic here.  I pay tribute to him and to his chairmanship of the board. It is not often that a situation like this persists for so long without a major problem or a scandal.  When one considers that this has been going now for over 30 years it is a tribute to the people involved that it has been operating as well as it can.</P>
    <P>The changes that brought about the need for this Bill happened shortly after President Reagan's visit, when for the first time the US decided to top up the money that was coming from the interest payments of the fund.  They were willing to do this without any great <i>quid pro quo</i> from our side.  This is to be warmly welcomed.  We should pay tribute to the US for their wish to increase the fund that was available so that more people could benefit from this fund.  I understand that the amount of money available in 1987 on the Irish side was US$85,732, mainly interest payments, and US$123,441 on the United States side. No provision was made in the original Bill in 1957 for either side to increase the <Col N="444" /> amount of money available.  Therefore, I welcome the proposed change.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill to give this body greater autonomy is to be welcomed as it will allow for a wider examination of the areas and academic qualifications covered.  It is important that no element of influence can be attributed to any board.  When a commission or board are under the direct control of a Department there is always a suspicion that one has to be well in with that Department to get a hearing.  I do not believe that has been the case in this instance but, at the same time, an independent commission will be welcome.</P>
    <P>Section 12 states that the commission may accept and use, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, such other funds, goods or services as may be made available to the commission by the contribution from any source, public or private.  I assume that the purpose of the section is to allow the Government and private industry or individuals to participate in the commission in some way either by increasing the funds or broadening the scope of the academic or educational spheres being followed.  While the section states that the commission may use funding &mdash; someone may will money to them or an industry might decide to offer a bursary &mdash; but will it give the commission some leeway to seek funding?  The climate at this time may not be conducive to fund raising but it is important that we clarify that matter.  I understand the position in Spain, which also has a bilateral arrangement with the United States, is that approximately half the money used comes from joint Spanish-US funding, while the remainder comes from fund raising, donations, bursaries, bequests and so on.  It is possible that someone who has benefited from one of these exchange scholarships may leave the commission money in their will so that other students may benefit or may find themselves in a position to give a gift or donation.</P>
    <P>When the original Bill was debated back in 1957 the then leader of my party, Mr. James Dillon, and Mr. Declan Costello contributed.  Mr. Dillon stated <Col N="445" /> that he was fearful that there would only be cultural exchanges in the Humanities and the areas of medicine and engineering while the area of agricultural science, which was most applicable to Ireland, would not get its fair share.  Perhaps the Minister of State when replying will reassure me that the wise words spoken by Mr. Dillon on 27 November 1957 were taken on board by the then Minister, Mr. Aiken, and exchanges have taken place in the agricultural sciences.</P>
    <P>The proposed improvements to the scheme should not present the House with any great difficulties.  It is non controversial and has been of great benefit to the country.  Obviously, at times some universities may feel they do not receive full benefit from it.  The commission decide which universities will participate in the scheme.  For example, the University of Limerick, may apply to the commission for permission to have, say, a Professor of Applied Mathematics from the United States to teach in the college for one year and the commission, in turn, seek applicants from universities in the United States.  As I have not been able in the short time available to me to obtain full details, perhaps the Minister of State will outline the way the universities are chosen.  It is important that selected universities do not get their foot in the door and always end up as the institutions chosen.</P>
    <P>We are often critical of the United States in this House but this exchange scheme represents another close and warm link our people have with that country.  All too often we do not pay tribute to it for the generosity it has shown to our students and young people who have obtained work there.  The United States has been subjected to much criticism in recent months &mdash; I joined in it &mdash; but we must give credit where it is due and commend and thank the United States not only for starting the scheme, with a generous donation of £500,000, back in 1957 but for broadening the scope of the scheme to ensure that it is in keeping with the Fulbright scheme.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that today we are talking about a fund which was <Col N="446" /> established soon after the Marshal Plan was set up following the Second World War.  Something along the lines of that plan is needed to assist the emerging nations of Eastern Europe.  I warmly welcome the Bill.  I ask the Minister of State when replying to set my mind at rest on some of the points I raised today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party broadly welcome this Bill but there are a number of points which would enhance the legislation.  I am very glad that the Minister of State began by paying tribute to An Bord Scoláireachtaí Comhalairte who have over the years provided assistance to people to travel to the United States, both for short and long visits.  I was very interested in their work.  I visited the United States as a post graduate student in the sixties and again in the seventies when I went back to the mid-west as a teacher.  Only two years ago I visited Berkeley University among others as a visiting scholar.  I have to say that the exchanges facilitated by the board have proved to be of enormous benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to reflect on the changes which have taken place between my visits in the sixties and more recent visits in the eighties.  The people who benefited in the sixties were very often underfunded at home.  It was only, for example, in the second half of the sixties that people began to talk about science, but bureaucratic opinion in this country refused adamantly to regard psychological, social or legal sciences as sciences at all.  The crude definition in the academic world was that anything for which you wore a white coat during the day was a science and anything for which you did not wear a white coat was not a science at all.  The National Science Council held their obdurate opinion about this rather limited view of the sciences and were replaced by other bodies, which had the practical effect in the seventies that an honours student with first or second honours grade I in any one of the sciences could proceed automatically to post-graduate work, whereas an honours student in one of the psychological or <Col N="447" /> social sciences or economic sciences had no grant funding or aid whatsoever.</P>
    <P>This indication of the limited thinking in the academic world and the paucity of philosophical training which did not understand the debate between the physical and human sciences and any of the philosophical assumptions involved, unfortunately was rampant throughout the Department of Education and occasionally, by extension, the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In this atmosphere of the sixties, the first grants become available, usually through fellowships, straightforward grants or teaching assistantships in the US universities. People found the procedure cumbersome.</P>
    <P>If I have a criticism about the operations of An Bord Scoláireachtaí Comhalairte it is that at times their requirements were often difficult to fulfil.  You had to apply early in the year for qualification late in the autumn.  This had further conditions attached to it.  You had to have been accepted in an American university to benefit, and to meet this condition you would, of course, have to assure the people towards whom you were directed that you would arrive and you would have to do this without knowing whether you would have your ticket.</P>
    <P>Many of us are survivors of those times of under-funding in Irish education which it is to be hoped will gradually dribble to an end over time until education will be properly funded, but I recall those times very well.  The distinguished contributors now to the social and economic sciences &mdash; one of the luminaries being Professor Damien Hannon of the ESRI &mdash; went at that time to the mid-west of the US and the grants given by the board were of immense assistance.</P>
    <P>At this stage let me reflect on one of the strengths of the board, the qualifications of the people who made the decisions.  They were made with an assurance of academic independence and integrity and I had never any doubt that the people who went were of the first order.  They not only benefited but as the Minister said correctly, made valuable <Col N="448" /> contributions later.  I wish the Minister had said a little more about the qualifications of the people who will sit on the new board.  I would like some assurance in this regard.  However, I always thought this is effectively an educational matter, a rather rare outcome in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  There is some confusion even today about whether this is an educational matter or a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs. Anyhow, it is introduced by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  However, we need an assurance about the qualifications now suggested. There is quite a difference between a board of academics, for example, as I understand prevailed in the days of An Bord Scoláireachtaí Comhalairte and a board composed jointly of ministerial nominations on the one hand and by representatives of the embassy on the other.  I would like assurances on the academic content of the ministerial component &mdash; which I might readily receive &mdash; but also about the appointees from the embassy.</P>
    <P>There are those of us who went to the US.  I did not avail of this scheme because I was always acting in a slightly different realm and often had to move more quickly.  However, I knew all the people involved and I think it would be very useful that we be given absolute assurances that academic criteria alone will govern the issue of awards.  We need that on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>There is no explicit commitment to additional funding in this Bill.  There is a suggestion &mdash; more than that, a statement &mdash; that the funding will increase, but there is no clear commitment to the provision of any definite sum of money.</P>
    <P>I want assurances on one very important point.  The scheme as outlined in the explanatory memorandum and in the Bill itself seems inadequate when it deals with the position of artists.  The explanatory memorandum refers to &ldquo;other related educational and cultural programmes and activities&rdquo;.  That requires elaboration and perhaps slight amendment.  Because of the exchanges that took place in the eighties, and which will prevail in the <Col N="449" /> nineties, there will be a number of individual artists who will not be part of a general cultural programme.  I am talking about individual painters, sculptors, actors, writers, poets, performers and so forth.  I need an absolute assurance that none of these forms of the arts is excluded by the wording at 2 (ii) (c) in the explanatory memorandum.  Because of the nature of the work of many of these artists, and their contributions, they are not caught in a programme.  A cultural programme is something that consists of exchanges.  It is built up over time.  It may have many different components.  It may move from one phase to another, but the kind of people going in both directions very often are operating for short terms within the confines of their own work, perhaps invited by a major institution if going from Ireland to the US, or invited here by a significant group who are interested in the arts.  That should be looked at.</P>
    <P>I should say a word about the construction of this scheme that has grown out of the fifties.  Certainly in the sixties the people who took advantage of the availability of funds to travel to or to stay for periods in the US if going from Ireland were much geared towards technical and applied instruction and they were, so to speak, in the first decade of the postclerical period in Irish social science. They found we went from a clerically dominated social science to a kind of crude empiricism and those of us who were then young had our first exposure to computers, statistical applications and large scale surveys in the US.  There we joined many of the other people who had come from different parts of the world, the Latin world and the African world. Then, about the end of the sixties, we were all over our empirical positivistic excess and had moved on to broader and more theoretical concerns.  In the seventies, the kind of people going were wider in terms of their orientation in drawing on what had happened in the European academic world and all over the world.  In the eighties, the people who came from the other side, from the US, have made distinguished contributions <Col N="450" /> and have moved from specialisms to broader concerns.</P>
    <P>This is a very valuable point.  For example, in that earlier period some of our very finest people now in the Department of Agriculture studied seed research and animal husbandry in Illinois and places like that and are now all over the place. It is very important that the new board acknowledge that the world of intellectual concern is now much more multidisciplinary rather than specialist.  It has also drawn on several different traditions. UCG has received many Fulbright scholars in subjects ranging from law to history, including political science, sociology and so forth.  It has always found them very valuable.  The fundamental point is that the definition of qualification for receipt of funding must be broad and it also must be flexible.  When seeking to match a scholar in a university departments in Ireland with a university in the United States, the titles of the departments will be quite different.  A student may come from a department of government in the United States to a department of law in Ireland.  The operation must be flexible in every way.</P>
    <P>Educational exchanges would be extraordinarily narrow if they were in any sense confined to third level exchanges. Some of the very best value is to be gained from exchanging teachers at primary and secondary levels.  If we want to exchange the benefits and the down side of our educational systems &mdash; and there are many defects in both our systems &mdash; to try to draw from the ethos beneficially and see the negative side, it is useful to look at the totality of the educational system by exchanges at primary and secondary level as well as at third level. Why do people go to the United States in many cases?  In the sixties, seventies and eighties one of the main reasons was the very large libraries.  Irish libraries were totally under-funded.  Unfortunately, because of university budgeting cuts, many Irish universities are cutting back on their contributions to journals.  It is no longer possible to keep a complete <Col N="451" /> series of the major journals in any scientific field.  The cost of a journal in biochemistry could run to a subscription of perhaps £2,000 or £3,000 per annum. Irish scholars went to America because of the quality of teaching, the capacity for research and the good libraries which were available, with quick and easy access to what was being published in one's field.  One could also publish very easily.  It is very important that we should not use capacities like this, which are very small, as an excuse for the under-funding of any of our research institutions or third level institutions.</P>
    <P>It is at the post-graduate level that the Americans come into their own.  They have some physical advantages there.  At under-graduate level I have found that the performance of the Irish student is higher on average, at least in my subject. An interface of exchanges which will benefit us both is valuable if it covers the full educational spectrum.  It should not cover just the full pedagogic programme but should include the research programme and should go beyond that to include cultural matters.  It should not be limited in cultural matters to people who are part of the programme but should include individual artists.  That would be a fair summary of my definition of its scope.</P>
    <P>It is a limitation to have too strict an institution-to-institution contract forming the basis of the exchange.  If one academic institution exhausts its quota it may have to choose between a legal scholar and an agricultural scientist or a poet.  It might have used them up for those few years.  If it is limited to institution-to-institution relationships we are narrowing it.  It may be that a community group altogether separate from an academic institution may want to invite an American writer in residence.  Recently a number of them have come for a year to compose music or to write epic poems at the heart of Irish rural communities. It may be that there is not an institution and a department within it which has made the necessary application for such an exchange and the community in the <Col N="452" /> hinterland would lose that opportunity. That is what I mean by flexibility.  We must get away from the narrow confines of matched institution-to-institution exchanges.</P>
    <P>There is also need for flexibility in relation to time.  The idea that one could not make an exchange within so many years of a previous exchange is important.  In the sixties and seventies the dominating thinking behind the generosity was that the relationship was one between a developed country which had become urban, industrial and technologically sophisticated and an undeveloped country which was agricultural and rural.  Many of the people who went to America went to MIT, for example.  The world of the 120 who are the other side of the Fulbright relationship has qualitatively changed. There is no longer a hegemonic economic model towards which all these 120 countries are aiming.  There is no longer any kind of hegemonic moral system.  The relationship has become at the level of intellect and at the level of work, research and arts more a negotiated relationship of equals, in which people clearly benefit from moving within a wider cultural pool where one hopes that the aspiration is that every country in the world should have the right to tell its own story, when women can participate as well as men and when cultures are regarded as having components which are equal, when religious systems are seen as various paths to truth which have emerged in the history of ideas and of feeling.  That is a warm and generous kind of world, even if it is idealistic in many ways, and one towards which we would aspire.  That world is very different from a world of utilitarianism.  I would hope that that kind of philosophical thrust and understanding and the experience of being in another culture is a valuable thing, maybe even more valuable than the narrow utilitarian focus of the late fifties or early sixties.  I hope that will prevail in the thinking of the new board.</P>
    <P>We must eliminate as much bureaucracy as we can.  It would be very valuable if we were energetic about this, in terms of not leaving it to the individual student <Col N="453" /> to apply.  What has happened in practice is that university teachers &mdash; I have been one for a long time &mdash; have had a certain amount of contact with different departments abroad.  When their own students are coming up they introduce them on. One puts oneself in the position of the student coming up to graduate and one has to write all these letters to different institutions elsewhere.  One can put oneself in the position of the person receiving all these letters and adjudicating or the person allocated to make awards.  It would be very much better to create a relationship with departments and institutions in which there would be an easier way of organising matters so that people would not be so uncertain as to what was happening.</P>
    <P>I am happy that thousands of United States students are coming to Ireland, not only for short courses in the summer but participating for entire semesters within our universities and colleges.  There are more academics coming.  They all realise what a very singularly stupid and offensive suggestion it is to say that those of us, such as myself, who have been morally prepared, and politically felt it necessary, to oppose aspects of the United States foreign policy in one regime or another, are in some way, in the crude ignorant remark, &ldquo;anti-American&rdquo;.  Many of us have been at the heart of America and many of us know and respect the warmth and generosity of the average citizen of the United States who is as appalled as we are when militarism or some kind of hegemonic purpose is used as a substitute for a humanistic foreign policy.</P>

      <P>As the man says, &ldquo;follow that&rdquo;.  It is rather difficult to follow Deputy Higgins on this issue.  He has given a magnificent philosophical dissertation on the role and need for student exchange and the benefits that flow from it.  Both Deputy Owen and Deputy Higgins have made a far better case for this Bill than the Minister has.  The Minister's speech was wanting, it was a lot of waffle <Col N="454" /> stitched up with extracts from the explanatory memorandum and had little or no information.  Deputy Owen outlined the background and the development of the idea of the Scholarship Exchange Board.</P>
      <P>I fully support the Bill and the benefits that will arise from the educational exchange programme.  I would agree with the point made by Deputy Higgins that it is absolutely crazy that scholarship exchange is still a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the Minister for Education has no hand, act or part in it and that she is probably not informed of the exchanges unless she goes out of her way to find out about them.  I do not know if there are procedures in place to involve the Department of Education. This programme is a fabulous development of education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support scholarship exchange which is a good scheme but like all good things, it is just set up and left there.  I would like to ask some questions about An Bord Scoláireachtaí Comhalairte which has a statutory duty to make an annual report.  It is my information that this board have not produced an annual report since 1983.  I have the 1982 annual report in front of me which gives the composition of the board.  The Irish members on the board are excellent &mdash; Professor Lee, Colm Ó hEocha, Professor Watts and Sarah Nagle.  There can be no doubt about their competence. Twelve awards in all were made by the board in 1982 &mdash; nine Irish citizens were selected for awards and three awards <Col N="455" /> were made to US citizens for research and lecturing in Irish universities.  Travel grants were also awarded.  The payments made to 31 March 1982 in respect of these awards, and the balance in respect of awards from a previous year, amounted to £12,900 for Irish citizens and £28,400 for US citizens, a total of approximately £40,000.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said the scholarship exchange fund was set up with a capital sum of £500,000 from the American Grant Counterpart Special Account.  There is no mention of Ireland having contributed a penny.  I take it that they must have been confined to using only the interest on this amount as they spent only £40,000 in 1982.  The Minister also said that on the winding up of the Scholarship Exchange Board, the moneys available will be transferred to the credit of the Ireland-United States Educational Fund.  What funds are available? Are we not entitled to be told how much of the £500,000 is left?  If the interest on this money was used over the years, the original £500,000 could still be intact.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also tell us why annual reports were not provided since 1983.  Did the Scholarship Exchange Board become defunct through lack of funds and die peacefully?  Why did the Minister not give us a full report on their work over the years on the winding up of the board?  Have there been financial reports by the board over the years? These are just a few questions that come to mind and I would like the Minister to reply to them.</P>
    <P>We are now setting up a new fund.  The US are providing $127,000 annually.  I cannot say off-hand how much that will come to in punts, perhaps around £80,000, which is not much greater in real terms than the £40,000 spent in 1982.  We have not seen a great increase in funding; however, there does not appear to be a penny provided by the Irish Government. Have the Irish Government given a penny since 1957 when the scholarship exchange scheme was set up?  Do they <Col N="456" /> intend to give any money now?  The Minister pointed out the great benefits of this scheme.  There are benefits for the Irish people who go abroad and the American scholars who carry out research in Ireland.  If there are such great advantages in this scheme, why do the Government not put money into the programme?  Any board will be as good as the amount of money provided to keep it going.  That is the bottom line.  If money is not provided and if people are constrained at every move, benefits will not accrue.</P>
    <P>I would like to have a lot more information from the Minister. Certainly on Committee Stage we would hope to be furnished with information in regard to funding, reporting, annual reports and on the whole issue I mentioned at the beginning, that of the correlation and interdependence between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Education in this matter.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to alter the existing arrangements governing interest rates.  The Central Bank of Ireland has <Col N="457" /> statutory responsibility for the management of Irish interest rates.  A similar position obtains in many other countries. This is based on the principle that interest rates should be determined by monetary policy considerations.  In carrying out its functions the bank must take into account a wide range of factors including the necessity to maintain a firm exchange rate within the EMS, the level of the external reserves and the flows of funds in and out of the country.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree with the general perception that he is now seen to be publicly at loggerheads with the Governor of the Central Bank, that he seems to be entirely ineffectual in giving effect to his point of view, which would appear to suggest that there ought be a greater reduction in interest rates than has been the case and that the public, mortgage holders and businessmen would tend to agree with that view? Can he explain to the House how it is that, since there are regular meetings between the Standing Committee of the banks and the Board of the Central Bank, when it is suggested by the latter that there should be a reduction of 0.25 per cent in the lending rate, subsequently we hear such comments from the commercial banks as that the increase should have been 0.50 per cent or greater?

      <P>I cannot accept what the Deputy says, that I am at loggerheads with members of the Board of the Central Bank or its Governor.  As I am sure the Deputy knows, section 6 of the Central Bank Act, 1942 sets out the bank's general function &mdash; to safeguard the integrity of the currency and to ensure, in what pertains to be control of credit, that the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole.  The fact that the Central Bank has statutory responsibility for monetary policy has served us well in the past.  I am not in favour of changing the position.  It is true <Col N="458" /> that on one occasion recently I felt it necessary to express disappointment that a reduction in deposit interest rates had been notified by a building society without a similar reduction in lending rates.  That position was quickly corrected by the building society in question. What was clear from that announcement was that the building society in question, one of the largest in the country, was intending to embark on a course of reducing deposit rates without effecting a corresponding reduction in lending rates.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister intend doing anything about the rate of outflow of funds from this economy which is contributing to the present high level of interest rates?  Would he comment on why it is that this country has the highest real interest rate within the EMS grouping? Having regard to our link with the German economy and the refusal of the German economy to tackle their interest rates, other than by monetary means, would he say whether we are likely to continue to experience this problem?</P>

      <P>There is a later question on the Order Paper from Deputy Noonan (<i>Limerick East</i>) in relation to whether we have the highest level of interest rates within the European Community. On the matter of the free flow of funds out of this country, as the House will be aware, we are moving to a position of free capital movements throughout the Twelve member states of the Community by 1992.  It is true that we experience outflows and inflows and that we shall continue to have such flows which may or may not accelerate in 1992.  It is a question of the overall economic management of our economy &mdash; and whether the requisite confidence obtains therein &mdash; where investors invest their money. At present we are enjoying a considerable flow of funds in our favour.  Nevertheless, from time to time, for commercial and business reasons, including the spread of portfolio risk, Irish pension fund managers and others have spread some of their funds in international equities, in Government stocks <Col N="459" /> or whatever.  That is a matter for them. That causes certain outflows at certain times when, for example, there is a wide differential between the Irish punt and sterling when some people buy forward in order to protect their profit and loss accounts.  All of those are commercial factors.  But the Central Bank take into account all the factors I have outlined here and will continue to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The new computerised customs clearance system, automated entry processing (AEP), was introduced from 31 March 1991 at all import and export points.  This new system, which is geared towards providing a modern efficient customs clearance service, provides for the computerised processing of customs entry documents and introduces revised and more flexible arrangements for the payment of customs duties and other import and export charges.  It will thus be of significant benefit to Irish importers and exporters in their preparations for the advent of the Single Market in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The AEP system itself and the managed network &mdash; operated by the Telecom Éireann/An Post subsidiary, the Irish National Electronic Trading Agency (INET) &mdash; which allows traders direct access to AEP are based on the most up-to-date open system standards <Col N="460" /> as recommended by both the EC and the UN.  As far as INET is concerned, AEP access is but the first of many trade related services which will be provided on their managed network and which I am confident will greatly assist the Irish trading community in their preparations for the completion of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>By way of background I should say that the number of consignments dealt with by customs has been increasing steadily for some years now due to the increased volume of trade and growth in the use of just-in-time (JIT) consignments and deliveries.  The introduction of the new system is in response to the many requests from trade representative bodies for implementation of such a system and the fact that similar systems are either in place or being developed in all other member states of the European Community. While it is correct to say that customs documentation will not be required for most intra-Community trade after 1993 the AEP system will have a continuing and very significant role in dealing with non-EC trade.  It is intended to further enhance and develop the system to deal with other customs and trade-related procedures.</P>
    <P>Under AEP, traders may have their goods cleared by inputting customs entry data electronically to the AEP system from their offices by a service known as direct trade input (DTI).  This gives them the full benefit of the new system and a better service than under the old arrangements. The alternative, but less desirable option, is for them to lodge entry documents for customs input (CI) to the AEP system.</P>
    <P>Traders experienced some delays at certain cross-Border customs stations during the first two weeks of the new system.  These delays were attributable to two factors: the failure of the majority of customs clearance agents operating at the Border to avail of the DTI service and inaccuracies in documentation presented to customs for customs input.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Border agents not to avail of the DTI service to date is one that I regret, particularly as the benefits of this service are already becoming <Col N="461" /> apparent to the increasing numbers of traders who are availing of it at various other entry points around the country and are getting a better customs clearance service as a result.  The initial low uptake of the DTI system has thrown an added burden on the customs staff in having to themselves input the data from relevant forms.  The Revenue Commissioners have taken action to alleviate this by allocating additional staff and computer terminals at Border import points.</P>
    <P>Generally the service to traders who have not yet participated in DTI who present correct documentation for customs input is comparable to what they received heretofore.  However, as I have intimated, over 50 per cent of all documents presented for customs input during the first week of the new system were rejected because of inaccurate or incomplete information.  This related mainly to the use of incorrect VAT numbers and the fact that many agents had not been authorised by importers to make an entry on their behalf under the new arrangements. The necessity for accurate documentation and timely authorisation of agents had been signalled to the trade well in advance by the customs authorities.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the standard of documentation is now improving.  This fact together with the increasing familiarity of users with the new system has contributed to a marked improvement in the situation at the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish you had advised the Minister of that, having regard to his long reply.  Can the Minister say why agents are refusing to use the system at the Border?  What was the capital cost of installing this system?  Is it true that the Institute of Freight Forwarders <Col N="462" /> of Ireland said that the system was unnecessary since they had their own system called ICARUS?  What is the running cost of the agency which is run jointly by Telecom and An Post and the cost of the 40 to 50 officials who have been working on the system to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will be able to answer all the questions as we go along.  The Deputy may have to repeat some of them.  It is a matter for decision by the customs clearance agents as to why they avail of this system.  To date at Dundalk all the customs clearance agents have not taken up the system.  The long delays which took place, although the position is improving, resulted from errors in documentation.  It is difficult to understand why there should be a 50 per cent error in documentation from people who are so experienced at this business over the years.  However, that is a fact of life and it caused considerable delays. When one contrasts that with, say, Dublin Airport &mdash; which is extremely busy &mdash; or the port of Waterford, one finds a totally different result.  It is a matter for decision by the people themselves whether they input into the system or not.  It is suggested that perhaps they held the view that this system might not be introduced until 1993, although it was signalled well in advance and had been requested and pursued strongly by the CII, by Irish exporters and many in the trade, in an effort to prepare Irish industry in a cost effective and efficient manner for the coming of the Single Market in 1992.  The cost to a particular agent to update his system to input into it can be a variable one: it could be as low as £4,000 or it could be as high as £25,000 or £30,000, depending on the state of development of computerisation in a particular customs clearance agent's position.  I visited them last Friday and met a number of the officials and we talked through the difficulties but it is still a matter of judgment for them.  It was interesting to note during our conversation that some of the companies had made considerable investment in computerisation only last year and they had to decide, in making that investment, <Col N="463" /> whether they would recover the cost by 1993.  That was their judgment and they still have a decision to make in relation to this system.  The system is good; it has many other ancillary services that can be developed from it and it is preparing Irish exporters and importers for the coming of the Single Market.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Irish interest rates are the highest real interest rates in the EC; the steps he intends taking to put fiscal policies in place which will enable the Central Bank to reduce interest rates.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Central Bank, that real interest rates in Ireland as measured by the prime lending rate deflated by consumer prices are not the highest in the EC.  For example, Irish prime lending rates, in inflation adjusted terms, are lower than those in Denmark and Belgium, and are approximately the same as those in Germany and the Netherlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards fiscal measures, the Deputy will be aware of the very considerable progress already made in reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement and the debt as a percentage of GNP.  This, together with the maintenance of a firm exchange rate policy within the EMS, has <Col N="464" /> allowed us to make considerable progress towards reducing the relative level of Irish interest rates.  To maintain this progress, the aim of fiscal policy will be, as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> to continue to reduce the national debt to GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993 and, as part of this, to achieve broad balance in the current budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would the Minister agree that he is using the statistics to bolster a weak case when he is quoting prime lending rates?  The overdraft rate in Ireland, which is the one that affects most people as the measure of interest rates, is the highest real interest rate in the Community.  May I ask the Minister, in the area over which he has some discretion, the differential between Irish rates and German rates? Can he explain why the differential in Holland is .50 per cent, why the differential in Belgium is .75 per cent and why the differential here is over 2 per cent in circumstances when the three currencies are aligned to the Deutsche Mark?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true to say that the differential is over 2 per cent here, it is about 1 per cent at the long end and a little more, perhaps 1½ per cent, at the short end.  I would remind the Deputy that in 1987 the differential was 9 per cent.  It has now been narrowed by the success of fiscal policies that have been implemented in the meantime to bring that differential down to what it is today, at about 1 per cent.  It is true to say that there is a smaller differential between Holland and Belgium with the German Deutsche Mark.  It is a matter for investors' confidence as to how they want to see the margin they believe they require.  It is a matter for investors to decide into which economy they wish to put their money.  The fact that borrowing has been reduced from between £2,150 million and £2,200 million in 1986-87 to about £460 million today is, indeed, responsible for the narrowing of the gap between our rate and the German rate, <Col N="465" /> from 9 per cent then to about 1 per cent now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would the Minister agree that very high interest rates in Ireland are driving the economy into recession and are making it virtually impossible for the Minister and the Government to achieve the growth rates predicted eight or nine weeks ago in his budget speech and has the carry on effect of reducing tax buoyancy revenue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy says about recession.  The Deputy knows the definition of recession just as well as I do.  The last two quarters show that no way is our economy in recession or heading for recession.  What we are feeling is the effect of the general downturn in trade and economic activity throughout the world because of recessions in the British economy, the American economy, the Australian economy, the Canadian economy, or wherever. This is because we are an exporting country and because we must export £2 out of every £3 we produce.  Inevitably, a downturn in foreign markets, or even in our nearest neighbour, the UK, where over 30 per cent of our exports still go, naturally will effect the Irish economy. The projection at budget time was for a 2¼ per cent growth in the economy.  That is very far away from recession.  It is hoped that the lack of confidence that existed in investment all over the world as a result of the Gulf War will now recede and that in the second half of the year we will be able to pick up again on activity where we left off before the Gulf War started.</P>

      <P>Following the reform of the Structural Funds undertaken in 1988, in the context of adoption of the Single European Act, the resources of the funds have been substantially increased.  I am satisfied that the enhanced role of the Structural Funds in the Community budget will continue, and I can assure the Deputy that the Government are vigorously pursuing Ireland's interests in this regard.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the Structural Funds after expiry of the present round of Community Support Frameworks in 1993 will be addressed in the review of the funds which is to be carried out this year.  The Government will use the opportunity of the review to stress the importance of Structural Fund aid for Ireland in the period after 1993.</P>
      <P>Ireland's wider interest in seeking to ensure that the objective of economic and social cohesion is given due prominence in a revised EC Treaty is, of course, being pursued within the context of the two inter-governmental conferences which are currently taking place within the Community.</P>

The question of the continuation of some type of funding, Structural Funds or enlarged Structural Funds from an enlarged budget and the question of social and economic cohesion for the Irish economy, will be discussed in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference which is now taking place.  The Deputy and the House will be aware that we submitted a paper to the Intergovernmental Conference on EMU last January.  At that <Col N="467" /> time we were alone in making the case and led the debate for social and economic cohesion, but since then Greece, Portugal and Spain have given strong support. The Commission who in the early stages said that cohesion was not a matter for discussion at the IGC has now changed its stance and is coming out in support also.

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite confident that the assessment and review of Structural Funds towards the end of this year will show that not alone Ireland but indeed other countries also will need continuous funding for some time into the future to bring the economies closer together and to help those areas on the periphery to develop further so that we can all share equally in the success of EMU towards the end of this decade. That is a view that is strongly held.  As I have said, the Deputy and the House can be assured that no opportunity will be lost, and no opportunity in the past was lost to get the maximum funds required for this economy.  This country is regarded in Community terms as a region and no opportunity will be lost to maximise the amount of funds necessary to upgrade our infrastructure and indeed to help us make the transition to stage three of EMU.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give the names of the 200 State companies referred to in the Taoiseach's reply to Parliamentary Question No. 8 of 27 November 1990; his views on whether all these companies are still necessary; and if the Government have any plans to close down, amalgamate or sell off some or any of these companies.</Quest>

      <P>In the reply to which the Deputy alludes the Taoiseach did not refer to 200 State companies but rather to 200 State boards.  The Deputy will appreciate that there is a difference.  I propose to circulate the names of these 200 State boards in the form of a tabular statement.</P>

      <Col N="471" /> With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, and having regard to the fact that we are talking about State boards rather than State companies, the position is that the need for the continued existence of each of these boards is kept under constant review by the Ministers under whose aegis they operate.</P>

      <P>A policy review in relation to every Department takes place in the middle of every year, as the Deputy may be aware, and the effectiveness and continuation or otherwise of State boards come under that type of review.  At budget time there is also a review in expenditure terms in relation to the effectiveness of those boards.  That is the procedure and I am sure the Deputy is very familiar with it.  Some of the companies are changing face.  Some semi-State companies are preparing for flotation on the market, to develop more fully and to remunerate the Exchequer as is happening with Greencore at the moment.  Hopefully Irish Life will follow later this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In Madrid in June 1989, the European Council asked the competent bodies of the Community to carry out preparatory work for the Inter-governmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union.  In response, the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks of the member states, which was one of the bodies concerned, prepared a draft statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank.  The draft statute addresses the situation in Stage III of Economic and Monetary Union when there will be a single monetary policy for the Community and when exchange rates between Community currencies will be irrevocably fixed as a prelude to the introduction of a single Community currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft statute, together with an introductory report and a commentary, was presented to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council in November 1990.  The initial response to it was quite <Col N="477" /> favourable, although it was recognised at the time that a more informed reaction would have to await the detailed analysis and negotiation by the Inter-governmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware, from information which I have given previously to this House, that the work of the ministerial conference is being prepared by a group of personal representatives drawn primarily from Finance ministries.  While this group have considered the most important aspects of the draft statute in their discussions on monetary policy and institutional matters, they have yet to complete their examination of the document as a whole.  Consideration by the ministerial conference of the issues is linked with this examination.</P>
    <P>I presume that the group of bank officials to which the Deputy refers are the Committee of Central Bank Governors, including the bank officials who report to them.  I can categorically assure him that there is no question of any undertakings being given in any such group which would commit this country to any part of the proposed statute.</P>
    <P>The final draft of the Treaty, of which the statute which is eventually agreed will constitute an integral part, will be the fruit of discussions within the Council of Ministers.  It will then be for the member states, acting in accordance with their own procedures, to ratify the revised text.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>My best judgment is that we are a long way from that because revisions, statutes and drafts are only being looked at.  There have been three meetings of Ministers at inter-governmental conference level and, therefore, we expect it will be much later in the year before we get to the discussion and detail to which the Deputy referred, if even then.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister indicating to the House that the likelihood of this House debating domestic legislation to give effect to the EMU draft treaty, and its ratification here, is as far away as perhaps 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to say. Discussions at a very long meeting of the monetary committee this week concentrated on trying to speed up the process of review of the existing treaty and its statutes.  It is very difficult to say what the timetable may be but certainly there was a view that a draft treaty would be available for inspection by the middle of this year.  However, that timetable will not be reached and it will be the end of the year before that is ready.  Of course, things can change and it is very difficult to put a date on it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Have the Government formed a view on the ratification process of the proposed agreements which will be reached in the course of the early nineties?  It seems, for example, that any international treaty which forms a European Central Bank will require to be put to the people by way of referendum.  Is it the Government's thinking that there will be a series of referenda dealing first with the Central Bank, subsequently with a common currency, political union and again on political union involving defence?  Is it the view of the Government that all things will be put in place and that the question will be put in one referendum to the people when the time comes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a totally different question from the one we are discussing and the Deputy is well aware of that.  He also knows that many of the questions he asked are matters for another Minister in relation to the IGC on political union and, consequently, he will have to put down a series of questions in that regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>There has been correspondence between the Commissioners of Public Works and the Dublin assistant chief fire officer.  I would stress to Deputies, as I did on the Adjournment debate on 12 February and 14 March 1991, that Government Buildings meets the standards of fire safety as set by the 1983 draft building regulations including those governing access for fire tenders.  Fire safety and security procedures are kept under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the fire officer stated, quite clearly, he considers it desirable that the entrance to the courtyard at Government Buildings should be capable of admitting a turntable ladder?  That is on the record of the city council of which the Minister is a member.  Is the city fire officer acting without just cause?  Is he expressing concern without just cause?  Is the Minister questioning the judgment of the chief fire officer?  Does the Minister know more about fire safety than the fire chief in Dublin city?  Is this not a case of low <Col N="480" /> standards in high places?  Will the Minister answer the specific question which the city fire officer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This was all discussed in the House and, indeed, on radio on previous occasions.  A letter was received from the assistant chief fire officer of Dublin Corporation, on 7 February last advising the chairman that a particular type of turntable ladder could not gain access to the courtyard.  Notwithstanding this, the building meets all the fire regulations, both mandatory and discretionary. The draft building regulations have no statutory authority but are followed very stringently by the Office of Public Works.  There is 100 per cent access to the external perimeter of the building and dry rises, which are an alternative to turntable ladders from a fire fighting point of view, are fitted at each floor level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not prepared to accept the advice of the fire officer of Dublin city?  Surely people should expect the highest possible standards from Government as, after all, they set the standards in many of these instances?  Why is the Minister so reluctant to meet this reasonable request?  Is it simply a refusal or a reluctance to having to admit to being wrong?  Why can the Minister not act on the advice of the chief fire officer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Gregory that there is no reluctance on the part of the Office of Public Works to meet any reasonable request provided it is absolutely necessary and does not in any way infringe on security.  As the Deputy know, there are different types of turntable ladders and only the very largest one cannot gain access to the courtyard although it can gain access to the perimeter of the buildings.  There are other, slightly smaller, turntable ladders which can and do gain access to the courtyard. Nevertheless, if security arrangements permit, I have already asked Office of Public Works officials to examine the possibility of looking at this whole area again.  If security permits, they will come back to me with a report with some alternatives as to how we can accommodate both points of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I intend to take Questions Nos. 9, 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that I am in receipt of a proposal from GOAL concerning the limiting of lottery pay-outs to £1 million and the directing of any excess to the developing world and I have noted their observations and comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the many deserving organisations and worthwhile activities that have obtained grants from lottery funds.  These include areas such as sport, the arts and community welfare projects.  To maintain the flow of funds to these socially desirable programmes <Col N="483" /> will require continued support from the public for the lotto.</P>
    <P>Occasionally large jackpots are popular with players.  They help to sustain public interest in the lotto and encourage additional players to participate.  They thus help to ensure its on-going success. Incidentally, I am informed that the size of the Irish lotto jackpots is modest by international standards.</P>
    <P>To put a &ldquo;cap&rdquo; on the size of lotto jackpots would, I feel, run the risk of undermining public interest in participation and could well jeopardise the long term success of the game.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to issue a direction to An Post National Lottery Company to change the prize structure of the lotto.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is directed more to the excess of winnings rather than the distribution of excess profits from the national lottery to various organisations.  Would the Minister agree that a payout in excess of £1 million is rather excessive?  Would he also agree that the fact that people are playing for £1 million should be enough of an incentive and that it would not discourage people from playing the lotto game?  Finally, will the Minister reconsider the use of excess funds?  There are very special causes at the moment, such as the Kurdish cause, that would benefit from excess lottery funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole question that is raised by Deputy Deenihan and others was referred to the lottery company for their observations.  It might be of interest to the House to hear their comments on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary what the company are saying is that to impose an upper limit on the jackpot would have a number of negative effects.  It would be an unnatural development of lotto.  Players would allege that the lottery was being manipulated in the question of the lotto game. The growth in the base of regular lotto players would be inhibited.  In future it will have to stand up even more so to <Col N="484" /> international competition and if the restricted jackpot were shared then players could receive relatively low prizes.  If they want smaller prizes they can play the instant games which offer the possibility to win from £2 to £250,000.</P>
    <P>From the company's point of view, that is, the company who have been charged with the responsibility to operate this game on behalf of the State, they have to offer a choice of products and players are free to participate in these games which offer the prize structures that the players want.  It might be of interest to the House to know that there were only ten individual winners, not syndicates, who have won prizes of over £1 million whereas the total numbers, say, of match four winners has amounted to 1,554,954. The commercial view of the company is that to impose an upper limit would take from the game and would consequently weaken the lotto, and we are all aware of attempts to try to sell competitors to the lotto in this country from outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread public distress about this Government's record on overseas development assistance, particularly in regard to the Third World, which has undermined the credibility of this country when it speaks at international fora about its concern for the plight of people in the Third World?  This proposal offers an interim resolution of, for instance, the Kurdish refugee problem and would restore our credibility.  Is the Minister aware of the widespread public concern within this country with the Kurdish problem?  Surely in view of that he does not believe that this proposal would undermine the popularity or success of the national lottery but would rather have the reverse effect and increase its attractiveness because people would see that there is a positive benefit.  Many people are concerned at the moment about the widespread political abuse of the lottery moneys.  The adoption of what is being suggested would be seen to restore to the national lottery some of the credibility that it has lost.</P>

      <P>The lottery funding has been used on two separate occasions to aid the aftermath of disasters, famine in Sudan and the Armenian earthquake. These payments were made under the auspices of welfare, a heading under the lottery.  This category has since been redefined to welfare within the State. These payments were actually criticised by some of the people the Deputy refers to at the time and by Church representatives on the basis that Third World disaster aid should properly be funded by the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Berne Convention on Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats which Ireland has ratified, the otter has been placed in the category which specifies that it be afforded, as an endangered animal in Europe, the highest protection possible. It was decided, therefore, not to issue hunting licences last year.  While a final decision has not been taken in the current year as no request for the granting of a licence to hunt was received until this week, it is likely that the ban will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am pleased at the Minister's reply may I ask him why can he not make an immediate decision on this application?  This application, which I am glad he admits has been made, has caused considerable disquiet and concern among groups such as the Irish Council Against Blood Sports.  Could the Minister not be decisive for once and say &ldquo;no, we do not want any otter hunting this year, next year or any other year&rdquo; so that these people will not be kept on a string for two or three weeks?  Can the Minister say when this application will be dealt with?  How many days will it take before it is turned down flat, which I hope it will be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted Deputy Garland is pleased with my response.  The decision not to issue licences was taken by the Government last year.  Therefore, the question of making any other decision did not arise until this new application came to hand.  That application only came to hand during the past week.  While it has not yet been considered as I have <Col N="491" /> already indicated, it is most unlikely that a licence will be granted.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his Department have costed the financial difference in cross-Border trade if custom and excise and taxes were equalised between (1) Ireland and the United Kingdom and (2) Ireland and other EC countries; the extra revenue which would accrue, if this were implemented by way of (a) extra employment, (b) reductions in social welfare payments and (c) extra VAT paid in this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should emphasise, at the outset, that it is not envisaged that the removal of fiscal controls at frontiers, a key element of the Community's Single Market programme, will necessitate the full equalisation of indirect tax rates across the Community.  What is required rather, is a sufficient approximation of rates to ensure that unacceptable distortions of trade and diversions of revenue do not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practical terms, of course, there will be only limited scope for differences between neighbouring member states with land frontiers.  The Government have recognised the need in our situation, especially given the lengthy land frontier <Col N="492" /> with Northern Ireland, to attain, in time for the advent of the single market, a close approximation of rates with those expected to obtain in the United Kingdom. Substantial progress was made in this regard in the 1990 and 1991 budgets, in relation to both VAT and excises, and the recent UK budget also helped.  The incentives to shop in Northern Ireland have thus been reduced very considerably or eliminated altogether for many items.</P>
    <P>The difference in the respective standard rates of VAT between the two parts of the island has been narrowed to 3.5 percentage points from ten percentage points in 1989.  This should have an impact across a wide range of consumer purchases such as household durables, TVs, videos and other electrical goods, toys and confectionary.  Price differences on excisable goods which have given rise to cross-Border shopping in the past have also been considerably reduced.  For example, the difference for a gallon of premium petrol which was about 60 pence in 1989 is now about 30 pence. Furthermore, there is now little or no difference in the price of a standard bottle of whiskey and a packet of 20 cigarettes between the two parts of the island compared with differences of about £1 for spirits and about 25 pence for cigarettes in favour of Northern Ireland in 1989. The tax based price difference for televisions and videos has been about halved over the past two years.</P>
    <P>At the same time, having regard to the severe budgetary costs involved, we have sought, in EC discussions, to ensure that the eventual agreement, in relation to both rates and structures, minimises both the direct cost to the Exchequer and the risk of diversion of expenditures.  For the reasons I gave above, an estimate of the cost of equalising <i>vis-à-vis</i> member states other than the UK would not be meaningful.</P>
    <P>Although it is purely hypothetical, the estimated gross cost to the Exchequer of equalising in full our excise duty and VAT rates with those currently applying in the United Kingdom would be £560 million annually.  I should say that this <Col N="493" /> figure of £560 million should not be compared with the figure of £600 million in use some time ago for the cost of indirect tax harmonisation.  The latter figure predated recent budgetary changes both in this country and in the UK, was net of related tax buoyancy and was based on the assumption that less than full equalisation would be necessary.</P>
    <P>From a technical standpoint, the stimulus which a large scale reduction in taxation of £560 million would give to consumer spending, and indirectly to employment, could be considerable. Conventional economic analysis would suggest that the net cost to the Exchequer would only be reduced by about one-quarter, even allowing for favourable diversion of cross-Border trade.  As I have consistently made clear, however, such a major loss of revenue would be unsustainable.  The offsetting budgetary measures that it would necessitate would largely neutralise the economic benefits of the hypothetical reduction in taxes.</P>

      <P>The board of the Central Bank are not appointed on a representative or sectional basis.  Nonetheless, the composition of the board, reflects a reasonable balance of persons drawn from different aspects of the commercial and financial life of the community. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Government have made important changes in the legal provisions governing the composition of the board in the Central Bank Act, 1989, by increasing the size of the board and by removing the statutory requirement that two of the directors must be directors of an associated bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with the Milton Friendman dictum that regulatory bodies set up to monitor private institutions end up being the captives of the very institutions they are supposed to be monitoring?  With regard to recent controversy concerning interest rates between the Minister and the Central Bank, has the Minister ever considered calling in his nominees to the board of the Central Bank to ask them to represent his point of view having regard to the fact that regrettably from the point of view of mortgage holders and business, he is so ineffectual in having his way with the Governor of the Central Bank?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to enjoy this assertion that I am not having any success.  I have no intention of accepting the Deputy's allegations calling into question the integrity of the members of the board of the Central Bank.  The members represent a point of view.  The fact that they come from the <Col N="495" /> private sector does not add up to the conclusion Deputy Rabbitte seems to come to, that they represent a narrow sectional view of the operations of their obligations under the Central Bank Act. I said on many occasions that Irish economic activity can be progressively advanced by the lowest possible inflation rates and the lowest possible interest rates that are appropriate and prudent as the Central Bank see fit.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy has in mind the NESC view, published in their report &ldquo;Strategy for the Nineties&rdquo; in October 1990, that tax expenditures might be integrated into the main public expenditure decision-making framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with the NESC that tax expenditures should be viewed in a similar light to equivalent Government spending, in so far as the essence of both is a budgetary outlay directed at a particular economic or social objective.  It is <Col N="498" /> also my position that, in reviewing any fiscal measure from the standpoint of Exchequer cost and effectiveness, due account must be taken of other relevant dimensions of public policy.</P>
    <P>It does not necessarily follow, of course, that the only way of achieving the result sought by the NESC is to assimilate the review of tax expenditures into the existing process of decision-making on public expenditure.  I am satisfied that an integrated approach to the policies applying in any particular field is equally achievable within the conventional framework.</P>
    <P>Tax allowances and reliefs are, as the Deputy will be aware, kept under review by my Department, in Conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, as part of the ongoing development of tax policy. Wider policy objectives and other measures in operation are, of course, taken into account in the formulation of the tax measures announced in the annual budget.  This is the mechanism through which the integration of taxation with direct expenditure policies takes place under the existing arrangements.  It also ensures that the cost of tax expenditures is considered in the totality of Exchequer resources.</P>

      <P>Following discussions at the Labour Court in October last year, there was agreement between my Department and the union involved that the Institute of Public Administration would be requested to evaluate the changes in the post of Oireachtas secretary taking account particularly of the duties, skills and responsibilities since 1980 to date and that their findings would be discussed at a reconvened conciliation conference in the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>The institute agreed to that request and reported to both sides in February this year.  Bilateral meetings have since been taking place between my Department and SIPTU at which the implications of those findings have been discussed and, if necessary, further discussions under the auspices of the Labour Court will be held.</P>

Will he join with me in condemning the fact that his Department have made no real attempt in the negotiations which have taken place to date to resolve this run of the mill dispute?

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister may feel constrained from commenting on the dispute but may I ask him if he would agree that part of the problem is that the scheme in question has no statutory basis and this has led to ambiguity and different interpretations of the various responsibilities?

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware everyone has agreed that this Bill is non-controversial but when I spoke earlier I raised some controversial issues, in particular the publication of reports by the existing Bord Scoláireachtaí Comhalairte, the Scholarship Exchange Board. The last report received by the Library of this House was the report for 1983.  I presume therefore that that was the last report issued by them.  I do not blame the academic staff in the Scholarship Exchange Board for this as they have done an excellent job.  However there has been a number of Ministers for Foreign Affairs since 1983 and I must pose the question of whether any of them inquired if the board ever issued a report or if they even cared.  Indeed, did they even care that this board existed because it seems that the board has been defunct for many years?  It is extraordinary that no Minister has asked why there has been no report for seven or eight years.  It is stated in this Bill that the board must report annually but who is going to care whether they will report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated earlier that as this is an educational matter and so should be the function of the Minister for Education.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs does not give a damn as to whether the board exists. However, the Minister for Education should be very concerned because of the benefits to be gained from an exchange of ideas which is of vital importance to the educational sector.  I do not know the reason the scheme is of importance to the Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; perhaps an element of goodwill is involved &mdash; but it appears that the earlier fund was set up as a tribute to Senator Fulbright.  It presented a useful way to Senators or those who wished to have themselves commemorated by way of a scholarship to stash away some American dollars tax free.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It might be an excellent idea <Col N="559" /> if the new commission tout around the United States asking people to avail of an opportunity to have themselves remembered for life or commemorated by way of a scholarship by giving them 100,000 dollars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;and give us $100,000 and you might bring in some money that way&rdquo;.  If they are set up by an American forum for a particular type of scholarship, naturally the Minister for Foreign Affairs will not have much interest in them and there will be nobody responsible for seeing whether they report and, if they report, whether they produce a financial report.  I got the 1982 report, which was excellent from an academic point of view, but there was no financial report for that year.  Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs have any interest in whether the new commission make a financial report or any report?  I raise these questions not to create controversy in relation to the Bill.  As I said, the idea is good and we are all in favour of it, but will it be just allowed to die away?</P>
      <P>The other question I raised was whether the Irish Government intend to put as little into the new body as they put into the last one which, apparently, was nil.  If they put anything into it I am sure the Minister would have told us so in his introductory speech.  If there has been some input we have not heard of perhaps the Minister will tell us in his concluding speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 provides that &ldquo;the Commission may import free of import charges necessary equipment for official use&rdquo;. I am sure the Department of Education, and our educational institutions &mdash; universities, institutions of technology, secondary and even primary schools &mdash; would love to have the advantage of being able to import free of import duty equipment necessary for official use.  How is such a concession given to one small commission of an educational nature who come under the Department of Foreign Affairs when all education levels, from <Col N="560" /> primary up to universities, are unable to avail of such imports free of import duty? I may be wrong and the Minister for Finance may have told us a few minutes before he left that such duty free imports are allowed to education establishments. I have not heard of them.  Why is that provided in this Bill?  Will it be brought into other education institutions and, possibly, the proposed education Act?  It would be very useful.</P>
    <P>Educational, cultural exchanges and scholarships of this nature, the exchange of ideas and all that is involved in this from various institutions in the US and here, are an excellent idea.  Have the Department considered establishing a similar commission to spread this idea or assist other countries on an international basis?  Why is there not one body in Ireland to promote and regulate educational exchanges between all countries, such as Ireland and the UK, Ireland and France, Ireland and Germany or whatever? There is a need for such a commission if one is being established to regulate exchanges between Ireland and the US.  How are the other exchanges operating with no commissions being in place?  Have we no educational exchange with any country other than the US?</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand this except on the basis that we are in the old begging bowl routine.  The US offers us $150,000 a year and we say we will set up a commission to run this for them.  They are putting up the money and we are assisting them in the operation, but we have no idea, purpose, aim or objective in promoting educational exchanges between conutries generally and other cultures.  Deputy Higgins in his speech set out a very broad policy and outlook on the whole idea of cultural and educational exchange.  Have we any such vision or idea in the Government or any such objective in mind?  If we have, should we set up a commission to promote and regulate educational exchanges with countries other than the US?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill warmly and compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House.  The Bill proposes to establish a commission for educational exchange between Ireland and the US.  In general terms it represents an important contribution to the cultural side of Ireland's external relationships and, in particular, it stresses the close ties that exist between our countries.  These ties have a long and honourable history and have been defined in a number of ways politically and economically. However, of equal or even more importance are those connections that derive from people.  Therefore, I welcome this Bill as a major step in the evolution of culture or what I might call people-centred diplomacy.  I know the Government have been active in this area in recent years and in this connection I commend the Minister on the very positive direction he has taken in increasing the number of bilateral cultural agreements and joint commissions.  Not only have we bilateral cultural agreements with European countries but with the cultural blocs of Asia and Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a continuation of this policy and will give the citizens of Ireland and America an opportunity to better understand their traditions and culture, especially in areas of education and research.  The proposed commission will replace the Scholarship Exchange Board which have operated since 1957.  In the intervening years this board and its <Col N="563" /> associated organisation, the Cultural Relations Committee, have worked very well.  In 1988 the Government confirmed the importance of their work by doubling their funding.  By establishing this commission the important work of educational research and cultural activities will be put on a sound and solid footing.</P>
    <P>It is important for any Government not to confine themselves exclusively to the relationship of politics and economics. It is important also to develop cultural diplomacy, not only for its own sake but for the benefit of the organisations and institutions which are doing excellent work in this area.  In the United States one of the leading institutions of this kind is the American Cultural Institute.  This organisation was founded in 1962 for the specific purpose of fostering an appreciation of Irish culture and traditions and to give Americans a better opportunity to understand the traditions and culture of our country.  For several years this organisation has been organising and sponsoring all types of Irish related cultural activities and research and organising the stocking of libraries with books on Irish history and culture.</P>
    <P>The awards given by the institute every year are well known but there are several other aspects to the institute's work such as the Irish Fortnight Programme, the Irish Luncheon Circle, Irish Books and Media and the Irish Perception Project. I want to highlight the Irish Way programme which is designed for American high school students and gives them an opportunity to visit this country to study our culture and history and to use our research and educational facilities.  Programmes like this also constitute an important part of the cultural relationship between Ireland and the United States.  I hope that people like Dr. Eoin McKiernan, the very much respected president of the institute, will not be ignored by the proposed commission when they draw up a specific agenda.</P>
    <P>A number of other organisations such as the Ireland Fund are well known and well funded and there are many more. While visiting America last year I met the <Col N="564" /> members of the Wexford Countymen's Association who not only operate as a social club but provide invaluable help to visitors and immigrants from Ireland. They are an important part of the people-based relationship between Ireland and America.  Obviously both countries derive a special closeness and uniqueness from this friendship.</P>
    <P>I know that the proposed commission will not involve themselves formally with these organisations but they are not mutually exclusive.  Just as these American societies and organisations provide opportunities in their way, so also will the commission.  The commission will stand as a clear signal from both Governments to these organisations that they recognise the worth-while work they are doing.  The establishment of the commission is also important in that it builds on and extends the commitment to a cultural relationship with the United States. This commitment was greatly enhanced by the visit of President Kennedy in 1963 when he addressed this House.  We in Wexford take special pride in President Kennedy's career.  The Irish people regard him not only as a symbol of Ireland's contribution to the development of America but as a symbol of how, in that unique society we call the United States, loyalty to the so-called new world, citizenship of the United States and a feeling for the traditions and culture of Ireland are not incompatible.  To me President Kennedy symbolises the traditional link and the traditional opportunity which this commission will foster, strengthen and open up to the citizens of our two countries.</P>
    <P>As a Wexford man I also take great pride in Commodore John Barry, the founder of the American Navy.  Michael Murphy, one of Wexford's famous sons, is a great authority on Barry and does not lose any opportunity to educate visitors about his career.  People like him are symbolic of the essence of the real strength of the Irish-American relationship. In places like Wexford where there is such a strong sense of history and where we are aware of local emigrants making good, perhaps the commission should <Col N="565" /> include within their remit local projects and local expertise designed to publicise and highlight men like Barry and Kennedy, both of whom are commemorated in Wexford.  Barry Day is one of the great events in the Wexford calendar.  I can proudly say that the Kennedy National Park is one of the best of its kind.  Wexford promotes these connections and these commemorations in the United States as part of our drive to attract more tourists.  Just as this proposed commission is part of a wider policy to strengthen our cultural links abroad, these links should not be put in a separate box.  They should not be separated from the approach of Bord Fáilte as they seek to attract tourists on theme holidays.</P>
    <P>This proposed commission will build on the great tradition established by the Fulbright Hays programme.  It will also build on a more personal view of the Irish-American relationship, particularly as symbolised by these American citizens of Irish descent who are at the heart of this relationship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It will read very well in the <i>Wexford Leader.</i> The measure before the House is a rather humble one but a good prototype which we could usefully emulate.  The idea of education exchange is something we have underplayed and undernurtured but it has tremendous scope and potential and could be invaluable in getting us away from the insularity by which we are sometimes sheltered.  I fail to understand why it has taken so long to formalise the commission within a legislative framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> I welcome the idea of educational exchange.  It is absolutely vital.  It increases our understanding and provides incentives for the emulation of excellence. Above all else it helps us let up the blinds in Irish society to let in the critical daylight and provide comparisons with other systems, schemes and cultures.  It provides also valuable insights into how others live and go about their business. I join with Deputy Michael Higgins in welcoming the cultural interplay which inevitably will take place if we foster and nurture this type of development.</P>
    <P>One of the disappointments with our membership of the EC which is singularly noticeable over the years is that at various meetings of the Council of Ministers, there has been very little emphasis on meetings between Ministers for Education within the Community. Within the Council of Europe there are certain informal meetings from time to time but if education is to be taken as the vital social, political and economic instrument it is for the development of society we need to move towards a greater cohesion in education.  As we are on the brink of 1992 we should make a special effort to try to foster exchange between the educational systems in other countries.  I come from a town in the west where we have developed the concept of town twinning.  We have developed links between towns in various parts of France but one notes that this is basically left to local initiative and there is very little encouragement or prompting from official agencies, particularly the Department of Education.  Twinning operations provide valuable exchange and insights but we seem to think of twinning our towns with towns in France to the exclusion of the vast majority of countries within the Community.  Recently I asked the Minister for Education the number of second level schools which provide two continental languages.  I believe that in the entire country somewhere in the region of 140 schools provide two continental languages.  The majority of schools emphasise the importance of French, 140 schools provide French and German, 40 schools provide Spanish and <Col N="567" /> 20 schools provide Italian.  The remaining EC languages are not provided for.  I also asked the Minister for Education how many of our second level schools have language laboratories but she was not in a position to tell me.  I am not sure whether the Minister was being evasive because I believe that somewhere within the Department there is official documentation on language laboratories since they are all grant aided by her Department.</P>
    <P>Cultural exchange in a country which has found it particularly difficult to come to terms with our dá theangacht, bilingualism in English and Irish, is particularly important in providing the necessary bridgehead between us and our EC partners.  Apart from the initiative launched for third level students there will have to be a definite policy at second level to encourage and provide greater liaison and interchange of students and teachers between Ireland and our EC partners.</P>

      <P>As a Kerryman I was most interested in Deputy Cullimore's address.  He stated that President Kennedy's ancestors came from Wexford.  As I come from the next parish in this country to America I feel as qualified as the Deputy to speak on US-Irish relations.  I would go one better than Deputy Cullimore and enshrine for all time the fact that a Kerryman with an inferiority complex is merely one who feels he is as good as everybody else.  Let me say that it has been wisely stated in Irish history that a Kerryman founded America &mdash; Saint Brendan, who left from Brandon Bay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intertwined history of Ireland and the United States can never be denied. The cultural and educational links and the identities of the two countries are extremely close.  This is the result of historical factors of emigration from the time of the Famine.  I am delighted to see an improvement in educational exchanges between this country and the United States.  It is a tribute not just to American education but in particular to our own very high standard of education of which we can be extremely proud.  It is fair to say that American students could travel to many countries in the world before they would hit learning and educational establishments as fine as exist in this country.  From universities to regional colleges across the length and breadth of this country we can be extremely proud of the standard of learning and achievement.  US citizens coming to Ireland can look forward to one of the finest educational environments in the entire world.  Down through the years <Col N="569" /> Irish people, whether of necessity or otherwise, have been extremely interested in education and our second level colleges, universities and regional colleges have produced some of the finest students in the world.  Equally in the United States specialties which are not available here but are available there can be availed of by scholars leaving this country under exchange programmes.  If I had to add a reservation it would be that the Bill confines itself to the cream of the Irish educational establishments and does not appear to address in any meaningful way the needs of those with lesser ability.  It would be desirable that the Government, in conjunction with the US Government, would seriously consider the possibility of extending the sphere of influence to those who would not be as highly academically qualified as those for whom this Bill is intended.  If one is to have a meaningful cultural or educational exchange programme one cannot confine it to what I would describe as an elitist group, however deserving the elitism may be.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that the experience and benefits gained from this type of journey and idea be spread across Irish society as opposed to being confined to the few.  It is my belief that the Bill before the House today will help to dispel a myth which has grown all too sadly in American and Irish society, that somehow there is within this country what might be described, within parentheses, as an anti-American bias.  That does not exist.  Even on the part of those politicians who at times have been most critical of the USA it would be fair to say they did so on philosophical grounds rather than on any ground of bias against the United States.  In this connection I must mention that some of those, for example, most critical of the circumstances in which President Bush became engaged in the Gulf War were the first to condemn him afterwards for not intervening in relation to the Kurds.  Such people were right on the second occasion but were certainly wrong on the first; history has proved that to be correct.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> Of course learning broadens one's horizons. I think it was Davis who said: educate that you may be free.  In addition I believe one's horizons must be broadened, and travel broadens the mind.  In this connection it is my sincere hope that those who benefit from the provisions of this Bill on this side of the Atlantic will return home and deliver our people the learning, experience and additional education they have gained.  I should like to see some provisions included in the Bill stipulating a requirement, or absolute condition, that there be some kind of retribution to Irish taxpayers by those who benefit from this extraordinarily good scheme.  It is entirely desirable that those who would benefit from the scheme would not participate merely as a means of advancing their personal careers but would do so in order to advance the cause of the people who educated them here at primary, secondary and third level.  I know that the scheme is US-financed and that it would be difficult to impose such conditions. Nonetheless it is desirable that such sentiments be expressed and that, with a view to assisting less-developed countries in the future, the United States Government would accept such a principle from Governments worldwide.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the provisions of the Bill can be extended to include a greater proportion of our academically qualified people and others because the pursuit of excellence in one of the noblest human aspirations and ideals.  It is my belief that this idea couild be extended, in the cultural and other fields into the American and Irish ways of life.  Many American citizens have their roots here, many are ethnic Irish prople.  It is natural that they would be interested in their roots, in the genealogy, archaeology and history of this country.  It is appropriate that we pursue that line as far as possible to the mutual benefit and advantage of our respective peoples.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange. The more contacts and communication <Col N="571" /> there are with the United States the better it will be for this country.  For example, on the industrial front at present there are in excess of 350 US companies here employing 47 per cent of the total workforce of foreign industrialists. We have very close ties with America not merely in the educational field but also within industry.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill will afford many of our top graduates an opportunity to gain further experience in the technological, cultural, literary and other fields.  That must be welcomed.  It will afford many of our graduates opportunities to attend colleges such as Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford, Yale, Princeton and others, which will enhance their future contribution to this country.</P>
      <P>Beyond this arrangement or scheme there is no shortage of offers to our graduates to travel to America, Japan and elsewhere, in that Irish graduates are much sought after and respected worldwide.  I happened to be in San José recently where I met a number of Irish graduates. They were doing very well in the Silicone Valley and now comprise some of the top scientists and executives there, widely respected and recognised for their expertise and educational backgrouind. What worries me is that large numbers of our graduates who go abroad will not return, being snapped up by multinational companies and others.  That is one aspect that worries me about this exchange.  While it is a very positive development, nonetheless it must be acknowledged that we will lose some of our top people if they go to the United States; that is happening already.  For example, of the total numbers of students who graduated from the Chemistry Faculty in UCD over the past five to ten years 20 per cent only returned here, 80 per cent remaining in the United States. Each year five of the 30 graduates from the Chemical Engineering Faculty in UCD go to America, many of whom will never return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met one individual who had participated in a FÁS course in Japan.  I am <Col N="572" /> sure there are several others like him.  He was snapped up by one of Japan's top companies, Ricoh, worldwide, and is now working with them in the Silicone Valley as a scientist and doing very well.  In addition, one of our &ldquo;Young Scientists of the Year&rdquo; was recently snapped up by a large American corporation.  Not only was he employed by them but was given his own laboratory to carry out whatever research he wanted there.  This brings me back to the question of: what support do we give our post-graduates here?  There is very little incentive given any of our post-graduates to remain and undertake research work here.  Indeed the amount of resources we provide for post-graduate work here is steadily decreasing.  One can now observe several laboratories in our universities being closed.  That is a serious indictment of our policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the future of our post-graduates, our general attitude to post-graduate work here.</P>
    <P>I must confess to being very pro-American. I feel we can only gain from the greater Ireland beyond, in that there are 40 million Americans who claim Irish descent.  There is enormous goodwill in America toward Ireland.  There is a vast resource out there ready and willing to be tapped if only we had the will to do so.  Some of the best people to do so are our graduates who have impressed American society in several fields already be it corporate, scientific, or whatever. Indeed they are some of our best ambassadors abroad.</P>
    <P>One of our best selling points at present is our educated workforce and the level of expertise of our graduates.  That is one of the strongest points you could make if you were facing any group of American businessmen at present.  The more people we can send to the United States on this kind of exchange basis the better.  On the other hand, it is important that they return to Ireland to give us the benefit of their expertise and the knowledge of technology they have learned in America, otherwise we could suffer, as it is called, a further brain drain.  We could lose many good people who would have remained in Ireland if they had not been offered an opportunity to go to America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> To sum up, in considering this Bill we should consider the amount of money we are putting into our post-graduates at home to encourage them to remain in Ireland to carry out research and further studies.  We should encourage the people who will go out on these courses to come back and make a contribution to this country because, basically, they are the people on whom the future of this country will depend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this very important debate and particularly for their general welcome for the Bill.  It can be said that all who spoke were pleased that the Bill would provide an opportunity for increased academic and other exchanges with the United States.  Some of the points raised were technical and we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to deal with them in depth.  However, I will try to answer, as far as possible, many of the other points that were made.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies felt this was a new position, rather it is an extension of a scheme that has been in operation for many years.  Deputy Jim Higgins asked why it took so long since the fifties to expand upon this scheme and as I have said, the scheme has been in operation and is now being expanded upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owens asked if the commission could seek funds from outside source.  I will give her a more definitive answer later on.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the commission from seeking funds from outside sources.  I do not see any problem about their seeking funds from outside sources.  A point was raised recently by Deputy Deenihan that perhaps more money should be made available to firms for research and keep some of our graduates at home.  Deputy Owens asked also why the original board had four members nominated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and three from the American side.  I am afraid I do not know: that is history.  The Minister will now nominate four persons and the <Col N="574" /> American representative will also nominate four.  The old board, as mentioned by Deputy Michael Higgins, was not under the direct control of the Department.</P>
    <P>The secretariat and the accommodation was supplied by the Department but the board made their own decisions.  These decisions, as will be the case with the new decisions, had to be approved by the US Board of Foreign Scholarships and other agencies.  Therefore, it was autonomous, not under the direct control of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Deputy Owens raised the question of the delay in the introduction of the Bill because, as both she and I said, the agreement was signed in October 1988.  However, I am certain the House will appreciate that this legislation gives effect to a detailed international agreement which required lengthy negotitaion with another country.  It was important, therefore, that the Bill should faithfully follow that very detailed agreement with the United States.  For that reason the time factor for the drafting of the Bill was reasonable.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to Deputy Mac Giolla who was very worried that the Department of Education were not involved, that we in the Department of Foreign Affairs do a very good job, a job which is as good as that which could be done by the Department of Education. Because this is an international agreement this Bill is being put forward by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The old board and the new board will work in conjunction with the Department. Deputy Owens inquired about something the late James Dillon said.  I can assure the Deputy that the graduates of agricultural sciences have featured regularly in the exchanges under the programme and, particularly, in recent years, Teagasc have sent out a number of qualified people.  Therefore, I am afraid the late Deputy Dillon was wrong on that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins asked whether all the universities would be treated equally regarding the opportunity to accept visiting scholars and the granting of awards <Col N="575" /> under the proposed new programme.  I can assure Deputy Higgins this is the case under the existing programme, as he rightly said, and it will continue under the new arrangement.  Deputy Higgins, in a very interesting and informed speech, which was backed by his own personal experience, said he had to move around a lot.  I am not sure what he meant by that but I will ask him afterwards.  He seemed to look for a tremendous number of guarantees from me in relation to many aspects of the working of the commission. As both he and Deputy Owens said, the commission will be autonomous. He complimented the old board on the manner in which they had operated.  I have no doubt that the new commission will perform their functions with the same expertise and fairness.  If they are to be autonomous it would be invidious for me to suggest what they should do or what academic, scientific, cultural or artistic forms they should assist.  I am quite certain the commission will not take a narrow view of who or what should be assisted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins queried the academic qualifications of the new commission, and rightly so, because this is very important. I would like to assure him that the present chairman of the board under the provisions of the Bill, will be the first chairman of the commission.  That should in its own way guarantee the continuity which is important and guarantee that the academic qualifications of the old board will be continued in the new commission. Both he and Deputy O'Donoghue spoke about the possibility of getting secondary and primary people involved.  He is probably aware that the spirit of Fulbright is third level.  In relation to the point he made about artists, it could be accepted that a level of excellence and experience would be equivalent to academic qualifications. That should take care of the worries he had on that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla was very worried about funding and a number of other items.  He was also worried, and rightly so &mdash; and I thank him for bringing it to <Col N="576" /> my notice &mdash; that the last copy of a report he had was for 1982.  I can assure the Deputy that reports are lodged with the Minister for Foreign Affairs every year. I will make arrangements to have copies of the recent annual reports laid before the House and, indeed, copies of the financial reports which have been audited.  I do not know why they were not laid before the House, but I can guarantee that that will be done.  The Deputy was very critical of me for my lack of information as to the history of the previous board.  I honestly felt that most Deputies knew about the previous board and their funding and that is why I did not go into detail on it.  In relation to funding, the original board were set up with a fund of £500,000.  The interest from that sum is approximately £50,000 and that is the amount of money that was expended plus, since 1984, $127,000 from the United States.  Ireland has contributed to the secretarial expenses, the interest, accommodation, equipment, light, telephones and the various expenses incurred in the functioning of such a board.</P>
    <P>As regards the question about section 16, that section is there because it is written into the agreement.  I will quote from the agreement which, as I have said, we will deal with on Committee Stage.  It states that as an organisation established for charitable purposes the commission will be exempt from income tax and capital gains tax in relation to income and-or gains applied for charitable purposes. Transfers and leases of land made for charitable purposes will be exempt from stamp duty.  Inheritances applied for public or charitable purposes will be exempt from inheritance tax.  The commission shall be entitled to import free of duty the necessary equipment for official use.  As I have said, it is to faithfully follow what is in the agreement that section 16 is in the Bill.  The financial reports will be laid before the House as well as the general reports.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cullimore's remark.  Both countries can learn from one another and indeed respect one another's cultures.  The benefits that have <Col N="577" /> accrued to Ireland as a result of these exchanges have been widespread.  This point was also made by Deputy Deenihan. He feared that people on these exchanges might not return.  It is fair to say that quite a number have returned and have made a very valuable contribution to the culture of Ireland, to Irish industry and indeed to academic life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla raised the question as to why we have not agreements like this with other countries.  We have many cultural agreements with other countries. However this is a very special agreement in that it is an agreement between the United States and 120 countries. It is not just an agreement between the United States and Ireland.  All of us welcome the extra funding and the extra opportunities. To benefit we have to abide by certain conditions as set out in the agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins said this scheme is a humble prototype.  The Deputy wondered if it could be applied to the Department of Education.  This is not just a humble prototype.  It is probably one of the greatest schemes in the world and we happen to be part of it.  The Deputy mentioned that education is being neglected in the Community.  I have very clear recollections of Deputy Mary O'Rourke, Minister for Education, fighting Ireland's interest at many meetings in the Community.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue spoke about the anti-American bias.  I do not think there is an anti-American bias.  He also quoted Davis &mdash; Education, that you may be free.  I agree with his sentiments &mdash; this point was also raised by Deputy Deenihan &mdash; that there is a possibility that many people may not come back to this country, but the experience has been that most of those who benefited from the exchange schemes have come back and, as I said earlier, have used their added experience and expertise to the benefit of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There has been a very favourable reaction to the Bill from all the Deputies who spoke.  As I have said, I will clear up <Col N="578" /> some of the other points when we come to Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious matter and I raise it to appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision not to provide a special grant to Cork Corporation to carry out very important and urgent repairs to Parliament Bridge in Cork.  Some weeks ago I put down a question to the Minister asking him if this money was forthcoming.  In reply he said that because the bridge is not on a primary route money for the repairs would have to be provided from our own resources. At that time Cork Corporation had not received their allocation from the Department for the roads programme in Cork city but have since received it.  They sought an allocation of £4.5 million but received only £4.85 million.  Obviously this means that Cork Coporation will not have sufficient resources to carry out the very necessary work on this bridge.</P>
      <P>While Parliament Bridge may not be a primary route in the strict sense of the word, for thousands of people it is a primary route into the city centre.  The bridge was built in 1806.  It is an historic, picturesque and beautiful bridge.  Cork Corporation have taken the necessary steps to assess the damage done to this bridge, particularly in the last 30 to 40 years when due to the one way system in Cork great volumes of traffic have been funnelled over this bridge into the city centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main shopping centre in Cork city is built on an island between two channels <Col N="579" /> of the Lee.  There are approximately 20 bridges spanning the Lee into the city centre.  If one of these bridges had to be taken out of commission at any time the result would be traffic chaos, but Cork Corporation have pinpointed a bridge which could be used, perhaps Johnston Bridge or a type of Bailey Bridge at Sullivans Quay, adjacent to Parliament Bridge, in the hope that the Minister would sanction the £500,000 which is needed to carry out these urgent repairs.</P>
    <P>It would be completely impossible for Cork Corporation to carry out this work from their own resources.  There is a programme of ring roads circling the city which would take the heavy traffic out of the city centre.  This plan has been in progress for a number of years and is nearing fruition.  I trust the Minister will shortly make the very important decision on the downstream river crossing which will dovetail the ring roads around Cork and complete the whole system.</P>
    <P>Until such time as the decision is made and until we have the correct traffic system, we will have to funnel most of our heavy traffic through our city centre streets.  Parliament Bridge is a key part of that traffic system at present.  Will the Minister look very carefully at this appeal which we have made on a number of occasions?  Over the last two or three years we have asked for a grant but we have been refused each time.  However, the time is rapidly approaching when something will have to be done by Cork Corporation or the Department of the Environment.  I ask the Minister to give some concession whereby the engineers in Cork Corporation, who are very concerned that the bridge will collapse, may make it safe.  I am not appealing for funds from the road allocation but for this grant which we have been seeking for a number of years.  Will the Minister sympathetically consider it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the case that Deputy O'Sullivan has made on the need for work on Parliament Bridge in Cork city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1988, proposals were <Col N="580" /> received in my Department for strengthening works on Parliament Bridge.  The corporation's proposals envisage the closing of the bridge for a period of up to four months while strengthening works are carried out.  The consequent disruption of traffic would be alleviated by relocating the Mabey Johnson Bridge, which is at present on Lavitt's Quay, to Sullivan's Quay.  This will provide an alternative route for Parliament Bridge.</P>
    <P>As Parliament Bridge does not form part of the network of national roads, primary responsibility for the proposed works rests with the local authority, Cork Corporation.  The cost of such work falls to be financed from local resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided annually by my Department. In the case of Cork Corporation, these grants in 1991, total £810,000.  The determination of priorities in the expenditure of these grants and local authority resources is a matter for the local authority.</P>
    <P>The financing of works such as those required for Parliament Bridge by the Department must be viewed in the context of the overall funds available for road grants.  In this context Cork Corporation have been treated very fairly.  The overall allocation I made to them in 1991 was £4,581,000.  The bulk of this was for work on the national roads network and it will allow the corporation to carry out their very considerable programme of works on the Southern Ring Road as well as some strengthening of existing roads, bridge strengthening and traffic management schemes.  I have allocated £3,741,000 to Cork Corporation, between improvement and maintenance, for national roads in their functional area.</P>
    <P>The Government's expenditure on improvements to national roads is set out in the Operational Programme of Peripherality which I published late last year.  This programme provides for roads investment of £616 million over the period 1989-1993 of which £416 million will be financed by the European Regional Development Fund.  The commitment to the programme will naturally <Col N="581" /> limit the funding available for non-national roads, yet I was able to provide £79.3 million for such roads in 1991.</P>
    <P>A limited amount of funding is available for special road grant assistance towards the cost of providing and improving non-national roads.  The allocation of these funds is determined having regard to the priority of eligible proposals throughout the country.  Having regard to the level of funds available to me and the priority of other projects requiring assistance, I do not propose to make special road grant assistance available for works at Parliament Bridge.</P>

As a result, the strains which these parents <Col N="582" />&mdash; many of them elderly &mdash; are being put under as a result are causing a disintegration of family life and, where there are younger children in the family, are making it impossible for the families to have any sort of normal existence.</P>
      <P>The Government's failure to recognise and meet the need in this area is a national scandal, it cannot be put in any other way.  In the south Dublin area there are in the region of 300 people on the waiting list for admittance to Cheeverstown House for residential care as adult mentally handicapped.  Families are living under continuous strain, unable to cope.  Some families are in fear of their lives; for example, I know a family with an autistic adult aged 19 who resided at home during childhood and whose mental state is such that the father and mother feel their lives are at risk if the person remains living in their home.  They can no longer cope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the first time I raised the issue in this House.  On 29 November I raised it and the scandal of Cheeverstown House which has 60 residential units which remain unfilled.  Those units could take 60 people off the waiting list of 300 and provide full-time residential care if the Government would allocate the resources to the Eastern Health Board to allow Cheeverstown House to have the current annual expenditure required for the additional staff necessary to provide care for 60 people.  In this House on 29 November, the Minister for Health assured us that the problems which existed in the past with regard to disputes between Cheeverstown House, the Eastern Health Board and the Department of Health, had been resolved.  I pressed him to indicate how many new places would be allocated during the early part of 1990 to people who required residential care. The Minister refused to do so and on that occasion he, by implication, made it clear that, in his view, additional places would be made available in 1991.  When I pressed him further on the matter I was thrown out of this House by the Ceann Comhairle because I insisted on asking the Minister to put on the record how many new places would be occupied in Cheeverstown House.  He refused to reply specifically; I expressed the <Col N="583" /> suspicion that the Minister was misleading the House.  It is now very clear that, on 29 November 1990, in addressing the issue of Cheeverstown House, the Minister for Health deliberately misled this House into believing that the residential units required by families for adult mentally handicapped would be made available.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter never ceases to amaze me because every <Col N="585" /> time he comes in here he tries to dramatise human situations.</P>
      <P>We all share the Deputy's concern that the vacant accommodation at Cheeverstown has not been brought into operation to meet the needs of people with mental handicap and their families.</P>
      <P>The new Cheeverstown House complex was developed in 1983 at a cost of £8.5 million from public funds.  It was planned to accommodate a total of 130 people on a residential basis and 184 on a day basis.  The centre currently caters for 60 residents and 134 adults and children attending day services.</P>
      <P>It was clear from the substantial funding of this devopment, that the Minister for Health and his Department expected that a satisfactory service would be maintained by Cheeverstown in close co-operation with the other mental handicap agencies and the Eastern Health Board which is statutorily obliged to provide services in their area.</P>
      <P>Cheeverstown was funded for revenue purposes directly by the Department in 1984 and 1985.  In 1986, the Eastern Health Board was made responsible for funding the centre.  The transfer of funding from the Department to the Eastern Health Board was designed to build up a closer relationship between the centre and the statutory authority.  Unfortunately, this did not work and relationships between the two bodies deteriorated to such a level that the Eastern Health Board felt constrained to threaten to withdraw funding.  After considerable direct negotiation with the Cheeverstown House Limited Board, the Minister for Health prevailed upon them to appoint a new interim management committee to manage the service. However, the Board of Cheeverstown House failed to honour the spirit of the agreement and refused to stand aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1990 representatives of the voluntary mental handicap movement launched an initiative with a view to resolving the difficulties between Cheeverstown House and the Eastern Health Board.  This initiative was persisted with and finally in October 1990 a formula was agreed for a positive working relationship between Cheeverstown House and the Eastern Health Board.  This agreement <Col N="586" /> facilitated the full participation of Cheeverstown House in the provision of services to people with mental handicap and their families.  It also opened the way for the commissioning of additional places in the centre.  I regret to say that difficulties have arisen in the implementation of this agreement.  Once again Cheeverstown, for reasons unknown, are reluctant to honour the spirit of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, has dealt patiently with this matter.  He has allowed the various initiatives ample time to be implemented without interference from him or the Department.  This initiative must also be allowed to run its course.  I would, however, like to assure this House that should it fail and on receipt of that advice from the representatives of the Eastern Health Board and the other voluntary organisations working in mental handicap, the Minister will propose to Government a course of action to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister and I are very aware of the need which exists for additional mental handicap services.  I would, however, like to point out that last year approximately £160 million was spent on the provision of services to people with mental handicap, of which about £44 million was spent on services in the eastern region.  Over 12,000 people are in receipt of a day or residential service; some 4,500 of these places are located in the eastern region.  This does not include services provided by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In 1990, an additional £2 million was allocated to meet the immediate priority needs identified by the mental handicap co-ordinating committees operating in each region.  This allocation enabled 149 new residential places, 442 new day places and 21 respite care places to be provided.  It was also possible to approve 25 extra staff for other supports.  Because of the particularly serious situation, which existed in the Dublin area, £1 million of the £2 million was allocated to provide an extra 78 residential places, up to 200 respite places per annum, 184 day places and an expanded family support service for 66 people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> This year a further £1 million is being allocated to build on last year's developments. Discussions are currently taking place with the Eastern Health Board on the additional places to be provided from this allocation.  In addition under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government are committed to the development of services for people with mental handicap to meet identified needs in the years 1991-97 in line with the recommendations of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services whose report will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>I must also point out that allocations to voluntary mental handicap agencies funded by the Department have been protected since 1986 in real terms in recognition of the vital service they provide. I feel, therefore, that this Government's record shows a commitment to mental handicap services, and an understanding that this area should be regarded as a high priority.</P>
    <P>I only wish that the Members of this House right across the board would play a positive role in trying to resolve local difficulties in places like Cheeverstown so that we can ensure that the proper service is available to the people who require it.</P>

      <P>I have five minutes to talk about what I believe to be the greatest scandal in our education system; it is in the Cherry Orchard area the last corporation estate built before the Minister for the Environment stopped all house building in Dublin.  It was about three-fifths built at the time and it was intended that, when completed, there would be a church, schools and shops in the estate.  Since it was not completed all it has is a church &mdash; no shops and no school.  The Minister for Education decided that the children in the area would have ample scope with places <Col N="588" /> available in other schools in the surrounding areas.  The Minister saved millions of pounds &mdash; I suppose about £5 million or £6 million &mdash; by not building that school for these children in Cherry Orchard.  She decided the children should bus to other schools but did not provide the money for this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Minister for Education who has responsibility for schooling for the children of Cherry Orchard.  She provided no school for them and decided that there were places available in other schools, that they should be bussed to other schools and that they would get no money for this because they are less than three miles away.  This rule was made for rural areas where schools are three miles away, and they get paid.  The result is that parents in this area, many of whom are on social welfare benefits, have to move 1,200 children to six different schools.  Some families are broken up into different schools, some one mile and some two and a half miles away.  Most of them are bussed but many cannot afford this and have to walk.  The cost per child at present is £1.75 to £3.50 per week, some families with three children are paying up to £10 per week.  In one or two cases there are more than three school going children and it is impossible for families in their circumstances to pay £10 a week.  Many of them find it difficult enough to provide a breakfast for their children before they go to school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that the cost of this school transport would be £2,000 per week and over the past five yearse these people have spent over £250,000 because the Minister for Education would not provide them with a school of their own for 1,200 children.  They are keeping six other schools viable, schools which would have closed down but for the fact that the people of Cherry Orchard are forced to make them viable by sending their children to schools all over the place, and having to pay for it as well.  Under the <Col N="589" /> Constitution the Minister is supposed to provide free primary education.  These families are unable to provide the money for the buses for their children.</P>
    <P>The position has been reached where today two of the O'Reilly coaches have refused to carry 400 children to the Dominican Convent or the De La Salle school unless their parents pay an extra 25p per week per child, increasing the amount from £2.50 to £2.75 per week per child. The parents have been told that their children will not be transported to school on Monday unless they pay this increase.</P>
    <P>This is a scandal.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> stated that particular attention would be paid to children suffering from educational or social disadvantage, etc.  This is one of the greatest areas of social disadvantage in Dublin.  The people there are crying out for education, extra gardai and community facilities.  Yet the Minister is putting an extra burden on the people who live in the area concerned a burden which the parents of the pupils in the other six schools do not have to suffer.  I am asking the Minister to provide free transport for these children or provide a school in the Cherry Orchard area for those 1,200 children, which is what should have been done at the start.  I ask the Minister to help the children in this area by paying for their school transport immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>My first statement relates to the plight of the 20,000 persons on local authority housing waiting lists.  We have heard much in recent days about the plight of the Kurds and it is only right that I refer this evening to the plight of the 20,000 families on housing lists, 1,600 of them live in Cork city.  Despite all the hype and public relations exercises carried out by the Minister in recent months this problem is getting worse.  We have a social cesspool at present.  Yet the only response we have got from the Minister is that one house was built in Cork city two years ago and in excess of 20 houses were built last year.  The Minister indicated yesterday that the local authority in Cork will receive enough money this year to build 50 houses.  Yet the local authority only received £350,000 for new starts in Cork city this year.  This amount was presented differently by the Minister but the bottom line is that it will only build about 10 houses.</P>
      <P>At present in Cork a man, his wife and three children are forced to live in a caravan on an itinerant halting site because they cannot get a house in Cork city.  I am sure similar situations obtain throughout the country.  People who cannot get houses are being subsidised by health boards to the tune of £50 per week for rented accommodation.  The self-help programme in the housing programme is a sick joke.  While much publicity was given to the self-help programme it will only have a marginal effect as over 75 per cent of the people on local authority housing waiting lists have to depend on social welfare.  There is no way these people can help themselves; they have to depend on the State.</P>

    <P>The Minister should set up a crash programme of house purchase or construction to deal with the appalling waiting lists for local authority housing. <Col N="593" /> These people do not have any hope of getting housing at present.  I ask the Minister to set up a realistic programme instead of the series of half baked ideas we heard from him in February.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital allocation to the housing authorities for the traditional local authority housing construction programme in 1991 totalled £45.6 million. This is an increase of £11.7 million or 35 per cent over the final allocation during 1990.  These allocations will finance the commencement of 1,500 houses and the completion of 1,300 houses in 1991, with a further 1,300 houses in progress at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Needs are not met only by the construction of new local authority houses. One must also take into account the vacancies which arise in the housing stock.  Casual vacancies provided new lettings for over 4,000 applicants in 1990 and will add substantially to the number of lettings again in 1991.</P>
      <P>This year, the traditional local authority housing construction programme will be complemented by the initiatives in the plan for social housing.  These include an innovative scheme of repairs to private houses owned and occupied by persons who are on local authority waiting lists and who would otherwise require housing from the housing authority.</P>
      <P>The plan is the most comprehensive response ever to social housing needs in this country.  It is recognised as such by many of the agencies who deal with social housing.  It significantly broadens the options available to local authorities in meeting housing needs, it allows for a very much increased role for voluntary housing agencies and, through shared ownership, the mortgage allowance for tenants and the scheme for the provision of subsidised sites will help marginal house purchasers on the waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new measures, when fully operational, will result in the provision of about 5,000 units per annum to complement the local authority housing programme. The measures are a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the provision of housing for <Col N="594" /> persons on the local authority housing lists.  Instead of indulging in criticism which is less than constructive, every Deputy should do this best to support and promote the imaginative and innovative approach set out in the Government's plans.  That is the way forward in the future and the Deputy and his colleagues know that and should support the plan rather than indulging in this useless negative attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>My statement is about the Minister's failure to instruct the local authorities about the provisions contained in the recent housing programme. I am not being pessimistic or negative in dealing with that programme but aside from the glossy brochure we got, and the hype and the television cameras&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will get his say later.  Apart from all that, we have heard very little and people are waiting to find out how they can benefit from the programme. Detailed provisions, as a result of many of the announcements made, have not been circulated to the local authorities. Up to last weekend local authorities had not received a circular letter advising them how to implement the provisions of the much hyped programme for housing, for example, in relation to people who want to surrender their local authority houses and who are expecting a grant.  There has been no word yet to the local authorities from the Minister in relation to the self-help schemes.  If the Minister is interested in getting people housed he should let the local authorities know his detailed thoughts and he should not just be blinded by the television camera lights and the hype.  On the ground, the programme is not being implemented because the details of the programme have not been passed on to the local authorities.  The Minister should not wait until the eve of the election before announcing these provisions <Col N="595" /> again.  The Minister should let the local authorities have them now to enable them to get on with the job as well as they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that Deputy Allen recognises how important the social housing programme is and that he is anxious to implement this as quickly as possible.  I support the Deputy's point of view there.</P>
      <P>The <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> is a document of the greatest significance in the social housing area and has been acknowledged as such in many quarters.  It is a policy document which contains new thinking on the approach to the provision of decent and suitable housing for households that are not in a position to provide it from their own resources.  It contains radical new measures to improve access to housing, to expand housing choice and to improve the position of both public and private tenants.  The appendices describe the various new schemes in considerable detail.</P>
      <P>On the day the plan was published copies were circulated to all local authorities. Subsequently, I explained the plan to local authority managers and their senior housing staff, and officials of my Department have made detailed presentations to them on the new measures. That is continuing.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the plan, the housing division of my Department have been working flat out on the implementation of the various initiatives indicated. Circulars have already issued on the new loan and income limits for housing loans, the new terms of the voluntary housing scheme and the scheme for communal facilities.</P>
      <P>The first scheme of houses under the rental subsidy scheme has already been approved and the circular giving the full operational details of this scheme is nearly ready for issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mortgage allowance is available to qualified tenants purchasing a house for themselves since 14 February and detailed procedures are being worked out with lending agencies.  That negotiation as the Deputy will understand could not <Col N="596" /> take place until after the publication of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The plan made it quite clear that there were some legal difficulties attaching to the immediate introduction of some of the new measures, notably, the shared ownership system and the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing.  In order to avoid all possible delay in bringing these important schemes into force, I have sought expert legal advice on how it might be possible to devise interim arrangements which would allow the schemes to proceed in advance of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The new Housing Bill which is needed to give full effect to some of the new schemes is being urgently prepared.</P>
    <P>The plan is to be welcomed in its scope and vision.  I can assure the House that I and my Department will spare no effort to ensure its early and successful implementation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to the delay in the commencement of the downstream crossing of the River Lee to the east of Cork city.  As the Minister knows, Cork Corporation and Cork County Council carried out a fairly extensive and expensive feasibility study some years ago.  That was followed by a public inquiry which came out in favour of a tunnel.  A number of years later, the Minister decided to reopen the inquiry.  That resulted in serious delays in the development of the downstream crossing.  According to a reply to a Dáil question which I received yesterday, the reopening of the inquiry cost £400,000.  The Minister has the report and the Taoiseach promised a decision by Easter, in my presence in Cork, at the opening of the extension to the terminal building in Cork Airport and subsequently at the Marina industrial site.  We still have not a decision and the Minister's reply to me in the Dáil yesterday was that he was studying the detailed complex issues and that he could not say when there would be a decision. I forecast here tonight that we will have <Col N="597" /> a decision from the Minister with great publicity just before the local elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister in relation to this.  The downstream crossing is the last piece in the jigsaw, the last part of a complex roads system around Cork city.  There are multi-million pound roads in Cork put there by the present Minister and previous Ministers, but they are leading nowhere.  We need the last link, the downstream crossing.  The development of Cork is being held up because of the Minister's indecision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that at last a member of the Opposition is putting on the record that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, is the greatest roads builder since the foundation of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I said present and previous Ministers.  The Minister is not getting all the credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy at least accepts that I have introduced major roads developments in this country, dealing with roads in a proper fashion and bringing them up to European standards.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen must appreciate that before work on a downstream crossing of the River Lee can commence, there are a number of statutory procedures which must be gone through.  These procedures include the holding of a local public inquiry and the consideration by me of the transcript of evidence taken at the inquiry, the report of the inspectors who held the inquiry and other relevant report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the local public inquiry held in October 1985, a number of submissions were received on the relative merits, including costs, of a tunnel and the lowmedium level bridge.  In addition, I <Col N="598" /> though it necessary to order the reopening of the inquiry to consider up to date information on harbour, road traffic and cost estimates.  The reopened inquiry also considered a possible option of a low to medium level open-span bridge.  After two days of hearings, on 24 and 25 July, the inquiry was adjourned and was reconvened for a further three days starting on 12 December 1990.</P>
    <P>The transcript of the evidence taken at the inquiry and the report of the inspectors who held the inquiry have now been submitted to me.  They constitute a very considerable volume of documentation.</P>
    <P>As I told the Deputy in response to a Dáil question yesterday, I am now considering the report but, because of the importance and complexity of the matters at issue, I am not in a position to say when precisely a decision will be made. I would only add that there has been no avoidable delay on my part at any stage in dealing with this project which is scheduled, in the operational programme on peripherality, to start in 1993.  It has been already stated when it is due to start.  I have to carry out certain responsibilities in law and I intend to take my time and do it properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the long waiting lists for ear, nose and throat surgery in the Southern Health Board region, in particular Cork city. Despite all the words spoken both inside and outside the House, the position is still very disturbing.  A public patient in Cork city will have to wait for between one and two years for a tonsillectomy or an operation to remove adenoids or to correct speech or hearing defects. However if one has the resources and can go private they can have this operation carried out within two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who are affected most by this?  The answer is those children aged between three and a half and seven during their formative years.  Their performances in school are being affected very badly and if their parents cannot afford to have the operation carried out privately they will find it impossible to have surgery carried out.  I am aware of the families who have been forced to go to credit unions, banks <Col N="599" /> and loan sharks because they needed to have operations carried out privately. That is a scandal.  It is also a scandal that a differentiation is made between the haves and have nots.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made to improve the position by appointing an ear, nose and throat surgeon at the South Infirmary in Cork city but that appointment was blocked either by the medical organisations or the Department.  I am not sure which of them was responsible but I would like to know the truth.  As a result some children will have to wait.  I appeal to the Minister of State to intervence in this case where the appointment of a competent and suitably qualified man was blocked for either political or medical reasons.  The House deserves a statement on that matter.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be full consultations between the Southern Health Board, the voluntary hospitals in the Cork area and the Minister's officials in an effort to bring about an improvement as it is the weakest and the poorest who are being affected most.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Waiting lists for certain modern medical elective procedures are an inevitable part of a sophisticated health care system like our own.  Although ear, nose and throat surgery falls into this category I would stress that improvements have been made during the past 18 months.  The Government recognised that a problem with waiting lists existed in the ENT area and we took specific steps to deal with this problem.  Extra resources were provided and the result has been a reduction in the waiting lists for ENT surgery for both adults and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> The latest information available shows that ENT waiting lists nationally decreased by almost 9 per cent between April 1990 and February of this year.  In general, the situation with regard to ENT services has improved throughout the country as a result of specific measures which the Minister for Health has taken on behalf of the Government.  In Temple Street Hospital, for example, the waiting list decreased by 64 per cent from November 1989 to March 1991.  At the South Infirmary Victoria Hospitals in Cork, which is the regional ENT centre for the Southern Health Board area, the waiting list has decreased by over 45 per cent since January of last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State give us the figures?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our objective to ensure that this improved level of service will be maintained.  Deputy Allen recognised in this contribution that we have made a trojan effort.  I do not have the specific information he requested pertaining to the proposed appointment in the Cork hospital but I will refer that matter to the Minister for Health who I am sure will be in touch with the Deputy about that matter.  I am certain, as somebody who was in the Department for almost two years, that we have made major progress in this area and I think the country and the Deputy recognise this.</P>

In some periods of very low flow there can be weed growth which is difficult to treat in stretches of this route.</P>

      <P>The structural stabilisation of Ross Castle has been a major and complex restoration project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The castle was built in the 16th century but was vastly altered in the intervening centuries.  These alterations, together with a general decline throughout a long period, led to a weakening of the structure. Particularly serious problems arose in the mid-1980's when it was found that <Col N="508" /> substantial cross-walls were structurally unsound.  This involved considerable extra work and the main part of the castle had to be held together with steel supports to prevent collapse.</P>
    <P>These major structural difficulties have now been overcome.  The pace of the work has been increased in recent years due to the application of additional resources which became available from the EC Structural Funds.  The large external shoring has been removed and this greatly improves the appearance of the castle.  The recently increased pace of work will be maintained and it is hoped that the building work and fitting-out will be completed to enable the castle to be opened to visitors for the 1993 tourist season.  The total estimated cost is £1.8 million.</P>

      <P>I have, as the Deputy knows, already indicated that it is my intention to introduce legislation on matters related to the remuneration and superannuation of members of the Oireachtas and related groups.  That legislation is intended to give effect to certain matters arising from the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.</P>
      <P>The drafting of that legislation is at an advanced stage and its extension to deal with the provision of secretarial assistants employed to provide services to nonoffice holding members of the Dáil and Seanad would significantly delay its introduction.</P>

      <P>The latest published figures were included in the 1989 report and showed the position at 31 May 1990.</P>
      <P>For the Deputy's convenience, relevant extracts from the 1989 report are provided in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the following improvements were put in place in the post amnesty period and provide a foundation for further advances:</P>
      <P>&mdash;intensive monitoring and, where necessary, pursuit of those larger payers accounting for the bulk of tax receipts</P>
      <P>&mdash;vigorous caseworking of entrenched arrears with resultant adjustment to estimated liabilities and, where warranted, enforcement action</P>
      <P>&mdash;self-assessment of income tax and corporation tax with resources moved to the non-compliant taxpayer</P>
      <P>&mdash;improved quality and timeliness in the material referred to the sheriffs</P>
      <P>&mdash;increasing vigour in the use and scale of the attachment operation</P>
      <P>&mdash;the annual return scheme for VAT and PAYE/PRSI has allowed Revenue to use their collection and enforcement resources more cost effectively.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that the balance outstanding in the case of each of the taxes are an amalgam of the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;liabilities under collection and enforcement action</P>
    <P>&mdash;liabilities under appeal or inquiry</P>
    <P>&mdash;liabilities likely to be subject of a claim for late appeal or revision upon submission of returns</P>
    <P>&mdash;amounts not likely to prove collectible.</P>
    <P>In essence, a substantial proportion of the difference between the balance on record and the amounts likely to be collected is attributable to the anticipated reduction of liabilities which, of necessity, had to be estimated.</P>

      <P>The expenditure analysis to which the Deputy refers was conducted by NESC on a consultancy basis, as part of their on-going work programme.  As the report acknowledged, it would be difficult to attempt to collect data on tax expenditure in surveys such as the household budget survey.  The benefits of tax expenditures and tax reliefs are, of course, kept under review by my Department, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, as part of the ongoing development of tax policy.  These reviews are taken into account in the formulation of the tax changes announced in the annual budget.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The legislation governing valuation for rating purposes consists of the core legislation passed in the 19th century and two modern statutes of 1986 and 1988.  Apart from the changes brought about by these two recent Acts, the law governing the valuation system remains essentially as it was laid down in the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852.</P>
      <P>It is against this background that I have asked the Commissioner of Valuation, in consultation with the Department of the Environment and my Department, to review the entire valuation code.  I expect to have the commissioner's report in mid-year and when I have examined it I will decide on whatever legislative or other measures are considered necessary.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my press statement which accompanied the issue of the end-quarter Exchequer returns on 3 April last.  I pointed out then that higher than anticipated numbers on the live register could give rise to an excess on the Social Welfare Vote for the year as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget estimate for the average numbers on the live register this year was 228,000.  The seasonally adjusted average <Col N="529" /> over the first three months is about 9,500 ahead of this annual figure.</P>
    <P>I would stress that the unfavourable trend in unemployment so far this year appears to be related in large measure to migration trends &mdash; influenced by the UK recession, in particular.  There is nothing to suggest that it points to any shortfall in our domestic employment projections. This view is borne out by both income tax and PRSI revenues to date, which are well in line with expectations.</P>
    <P>While any deterioration in the projected level of unemployment is obviously a matter of concern to the Government, the overall budgetary position should not be seriously affected. The Government will continue to monitor the various components of the budget very closely, and any necessary action will be taken in the light of developments as the year unfolds.</P>

    <P>To improve security at the premises the following measures were taken &mdash; a replacement security firm was engaged from April 1990, the more valuable items of furniture, which were obviously the target of the thieves, were collected into a specially secured compound within the stores, additional works recommended by the Office of Public Works fire and security section and the Garda Crime Prevention Unit were carried out and the <Col N="530" /> burglar alarm system was extended and modernised.</P>

The internal windows on the corridors are being replaced with new central doors serving each pair of rooms to facilitate circulation and to increase the wall space for picture hanging; the electrical and mechanical installations are being upgraded to art gallery standards.  Some humidity control is being provided also; the three wings &mdash; east, south and west &mdash; which form the area of the gallery are being redecorated consequential on the building works; the north wing which contains the great hall, chapel and master's quarters is not being touched nor is the second floor; rooms on the ground floor are being refurbished in keeping with the rooms elsewhere in the gallery; and a compacted gravel surface is being provided in the courtyard.

      <P>It is presumed that what the Deputy has in mind is the treatment of goods seized by customs on the grounds that they were imported irregularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of payment of import charges does not arise where uncustomed goods are seized.  However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the bulk of all seized goods are released on payment of a compromise sum in lieu of proceedings.  In fixing the level of that sum in any particular case, account is taken of several factors, one of which is the amount of import charges which would have been payable had the goods been properly declared at importation. In certain cases, the compromise <Col N="538" /> sum may be paid upon detection to secure immediate release of the seized goods or it may be paid some time after the seizure, either because the person concerned did not pay the amount on the spot or because the case was referred to the Revenue Commissioners for decision.  Payment of a compromise sum may also arise where goods are retained as a seizure or where their release is conditional on subsequent exportation.</P>
    <P>The total amounts of compromise sums in respect of the years in question are as follows: 1986, £1.03 million; 1987, £1.26 million; 1988, £2.04 million; 1989, £2.09 million and 1990 £2.40 million (provisional).</P>

      <P>Following endorsement by the EC Commission, the ECOFIN Council on 18 March 1991 confirmed their previous agreement of 17 December 1990 to Ireland's request for a derogation in relation to travellers' allowances as a replacement to the 48-hour rule restrictions.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements, travellers who have been out of the State for less than 24 hours, and who are not frontier workers, will be entitled to import, free of duty, the following quantities of goods (whether obtained duty-paid in another country or duty free): 150 cigarettes; ¾ litre of alcoholic drinks exceeding 22 per cent volume (e.g. whiskey, brandy, gin, rum, vodka) or 1½ litres of alcoholic drinks not exceeding 22 per cent volume (e.g. some liqueurs, champagne, port, sherry) plus 2½* litres of still wine.</P>
      <P>*2 litres if obtained duty free or outside the EC.</P>
      <P>In addition, such travellers will also be entitled to import, free of tax, other goods purchased tax paid in other countries of the EC to the value of £85, subject to no single item exceeding £65 in value and to a maximum of 12 litres of beer. The 12 litre beer limitation also applies to frontier workers.  The existing value limit of £34 per person for other dutiable goods purchased tax free in the EC or obtained outside the EC will continue to apply, subject to a maximum of 12 litres of beer.</P>
      <P>The existing normal entitlements will continue to apply to travellers who have been outside the State for more than 24 hours, subject to a maximum of 25 litres of beer.</P>
      <P>The existing normal entitlements will continue to apply to travellers who have been outside the State for more than 24 hours, subject to a maximum of 25 litres of beer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the further decision taken at the ECOFIN Council on 18 March 1991 in relation to travellers' allowances <Col N="540" /> generally throughout the Community, travellers who have been outside the State for more than 24 hours will be entitled, from 1 July next, to import goods, tax free, to a total value of £460, subject to no single item exceeding a value of £72.  The 25 litre beer limitation will continue to apply to such travellers.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the difficulties which had arisen for Ireland in the wake of the European Court's ruling on the 48-hour rule have been resolved satisfactorily.  In my view the new arrangements represent a fair balance between giving all travellers reasonable entitlements while continuing to offer a significant safeguard to the interests of the general taxpayer and of domestic producers and traders.</P>

      <P>Work permit applications are considered in accordance with the provisions of the Aliens Act, 1935, Aliens Orders, 1946 and 1975 and the European Communities (Aliens) Regulations, 1977.</P>
      <P>Policy in relation to the granting or refusal of a work permit is based on the need to ensure that employment opportunities arising here are reserved, as far as possible, for Irish and EC nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The granting of a work permit is not considered unless an employer can show that, despite all reasonable efforts, no suitably qualified Irish or European Community nationals are available for the <Col N="543" /> position in question or unless the application falls into one of the following categories: (a) the prospective employee is a key worker and a substantial amount of high quality employment for Irish-EC nationals will arise as a result of his-her employment; (b) the prospective employee is married to an Irish or EC national or a dependant or child aged under 21 of an Irish or EC national; (c) the person is coming as part of an officially recognised exchange programme; (d) the prospective employee is an officially recognised refugee.</P>
    <P>Because of the current high levels of unemployment, my Department who operate a restrictive work permit policy in relation to the employment of non-EC nationals, must be vigilant in ensuring that permits are issued only where it is clear that no suitably qualified Irish or EC national is available for the position on offer.</P>
    <P>Non-EC nationals in respect of whom work permits are issued must also satisfy immigration regulations.</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular application in question, a work permit would not ordinarily be granted.  The position was that of administrative assistant and the salary was given as £65 per week.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to receipt of the application, the employer was asked to advertise further to ensure that no Irish or EC national was available for the position. Also, inquiries had to be made to ensure that no State moneys were being used to fund the salary of the prospective employee as it appeared that all the other employees of the organisation in question were on a social employment programme.</P>
    <P>When my Department's inquiries were completed, it was decided that, as an exceptional measure, a work permit should issue and I decided that the usual fee should be waived.  If the applicant had not been a charitable organisation, the application would have been refused.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the reason for the reduction in the unemployment benefit paid to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; whether this person's entitlement to benefit should be assessed independent of his spouse's income from a British retirement pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare legislation on the assessment of means for unemployment assistance provides that all income which an applicant or his/her spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year be assessed, apart from certain specified exclusions. Among the exclusions are short term benefit or assistance payments under the Social Welfare Acts to a claimant's spouse.  Long-term assistance or benefit payments such as a pension would be assessed.  As all foreign welfare payments, whether they be long term or short term, received by spouses of applicants are not excluded, the British retirement pension received by the wife of the person concerned has to be assessed as means.</P>
      <P>His claim was reviewed in March 1990 and his means were assessed by a deciding officer at £71.90 per week with effect from 11 April 1990.  He appealed the decision and the appeals officer reduced the assessment to £68.10 per week from 11 April 1990.  Following this, he was paid at the weekly rate of £7.90 from 11 April 1990 increased to £14.90 in July.  He continued to be paid on this basis up to 4 December 1990 when he commenced work on a social employment scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the fact that his wife was in receipt of a British retirement pension equivalent to IR£55.60 a week he was not entitled to an adult dependant allowance in respect of her as she had an income greater than the limit of £50 per week (£55 per week from July 1990).  However, this was overlooked.  He should have been awarded the long term rate for a single person, less half of the means assessed against him.  Arising from this he is entitled to arrears of £5 per week from 11 April to 19 July and £3 from 20 July <Col N="545" /> to 4 December.  Payment of these arrears due will be made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The appropriate social employment scheme payment is a matter for FAS to determine in the light of his changed entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>Physiotherapists wishing to work in the public health service must satisfy certain minimum qualification requirements.  At present, a person seeking employment in the public health service as a physiotherapist is required to possess a degree qualification in physiotherapy from one of the country's two recognised schools of physiotherapy &mdash; at Trinity College, Dublin, or University College, Dublin &mdash; or to have a qualification at least equivalent thereto.  There is, therefore, no question of unqualified physiotherapists working in the public health service.</P>
      <P>There is no statutory system for regulating the practice of physiotherapy, although the feasibility of implementing such a measure in respect of a range of paramedical disciplines, including physiotherapy, is the subject of ongoing examination in my Department.  My Department have no proposals to implement a charter for physiotherapists. Accordingly, the practice of physiotherapy in a private capacity is not subject to regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individual members of the public should exercise normal caution and good sense by ensuring that the practitioner of their choice is fully and appropriately <Col N="551" /> qualified before undergoing treatment. My Department or the Irish Chartered Society of Physiotherapists can assist members of the public requiring guidance in this respect.</P>

      <P>There was a wholetime equivalent total of 52.43 social workers employed in the Southern Health Board area in December 1989.  The staff involved were employed by the Southern Health Board, voluntary hospitals and mental handicap agencies.  The December 1990 Health Service Personnel Census is currently being validated.</P>

    <P>Under the personnel policy which applies in the health services, it is a matter for the employing authorities to determine the appropriate staffing level <Col N="552" /> in each of their institutions and programmes within their approved employment ceiling and financial allocation. Within these overall constraints it would be open to the authorities to improve the social worker staffing levels if it were felt that this was justified.</P>
