      <P>All earnings from the operations of the gallery's bookshop are used in the gallery's publication programme.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the annual report on the implementation of the reform of the Structural Funds for 1989, published by the European Commission this year, which states that the doubling of assistance from the funds depends on the observance of the principle of additionality and that this means that member states must meet the increased Community effort by at least maintaining the level of public spending in real terms so that the volume of structural assistance corresponds with the increase, and that the plans submitted by member states do not afford sufficient guarantees as to the observance of this principle; if he has received a formal request from the EC for a response in regard to Ireland's compliance with this requirement; his views on whether Ireland has met in full the requirement set out by the EC Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland was the first member state to supply to the Commission the full additionality information of the type referred to in this question. While the Commission has sought some clarification on items of a technical nature, it has accepted in principle that Ireland's proposed expenditure on structural measures should fulfil the additionality requirement of the Structural Funds Co-ordination Regulations.</P>
      <P>I should add that expenditure under the Community Support Framework in 1989-90 was in line with forecast.  On the basis of the latest projections for 1991, we remain in line to meet the additionality target.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has arisen <Col N="739" /> in the Inter Governmental Conference on Political Union.  The Presidency has recently proposed that the new Treaty should say that the EC shall respect fundamental rights and freedoms as recognised in the constitutions and laws of the member states and in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  As was the case in 1983 and 1986 when a similar proposal came up before, the member states have not reached agreement on the issues which are highly complex and of fundamental importance. While we support the Presidency suggestion, in principle, we await consideration by the inter governmental conference of the specific proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We favour the proposal in principle.  It is doubtful as to whether or not any such proposals have any great value, apart from a theoretical value, because all the twelve member states individually signed and subscribe to the European Convention.  There is not much point in the Community further subscribing to the convention, but if that is the wish of most member states, we have no particular objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a difference in the jurisprudential status of the Treaty of Rome and any amendments to it, which are directly applicable in member states, and supersede the law of member states, and the Convention on Human Rights which is subsidiary to the legislation of member states and there is a political requirement on member states to introduce their own legislation to implement it?  Is the Taoiseach not aware that if the <Col N="740" /> European Convention on Human Rights was incorporated in the Treaty of Rome that would entirely change its status and make its provisions mandatory here, whereas its provisions are simply persuasive at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is completely misinterpreting the position. Another factor to be borne in mind is the fact that the European Court have indicated in a number of their judgments that the Community must guarantee that human rights are respected in the operation of the existing EC Treaties.  When we take all of those things into account, first that the European Court have decided that the Community must adhere to the provisions with regard to guarantees of human rights, and the fact that each of the twelve member states subscribe individually to the European Convention, I suggest, and this view is shared widely throughout the Community, that subscribing to the convention by the Community as such would be largely theoretical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that some applicant countries, including Turkey, are attempting to become members of the Community would the Taoiseach not consider that an incorporation by the Community in the Treaty of Rome of the European Convention on Human Rights, would set down a clear fundamental legal basis for citizens' standards and rights here and in the Community at large?  Does not the Taoiseach, therefore, see the need for incorporating in a revised Treaty of Rome, the European Convention on Human Rights?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We are not against the thing in principle but we find it difficult to see any practical as distinct from theoretical advantage.  The European Court have already decided in judgments handed down that the Community must respect the guarantees of human rights and freedom in its implementation of the Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that that only applies in respect of Community law whereas Treaty provisions of the European Community supersede national law?  By incorporating it in the Rome Treaty, we would widen the field of application and strengthen the effectiveness of the Convention on Human Rights in a way that is not presently possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying, and the Deputy consistently refuses to see the point, is that the European Court, the Community Court, in their judgments on the interpretation of the treaties of the Community, have decided that the Community must adhere to fundamental rights and freedoms in that matter.</P>

      <P>Tourism was the first economic sector to be examined by the Anglo-Irish Conference when Richard Needham M.P., Northern Ireland Minister for the Economy and I briefed the conference on cross-Border tourism co-operation last July.</P>
      <P>Mr. Needham and I have since discussed the potential for closer co-operation and we both agree that future co-operation should concentrate on jointly exploiting new markets based on common tourism strengths, to the mutual benefit of both economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of our discussions, Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board have since agreed and begun addressing the implementation of a series of initiatives focusing on the generation of incremental business through the promotion of special products and activities; a marketing drive in specific segments <Col N="749" /> of main overseas markets; joint market research; increased co-operation at industry level in the Ireland market and extended reciprocal customer services.</P>
    <P>These will build on previous ongoing arrangements between the two agencies in the area of joint marketing and on special projects which they are involved in under the aegis of the International Fund for Ireland, namely an all-Ireland Marketing Project, an all-Ireland Computerised Information and Reservation System, and an all-Ireland Genealogy Project.</P>
    <P>The chairmen and senior executives of both boards meet frequently to oversee progress on the full range of joint activities. In addition, staff at all levels meet to implement programmes at home and abroad, covering areas such as joint research, participation in workshops, reciprocal stocking of literature at tourist information offices in the Border areas and joint operation of the &ldquo;Ireland Desk&rdquo; in the British Travel Authority's Travel Centre in London.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that notwithstanding progress to date, I will continue to monitor closely the scope, range, and potential for cross-Border co-operation where such co-operation can clearly contribute to increasing tourism into Ireland, North and South.</P>

      <P>The Minister has outlined details of work and negotiations he has been involved in.  Will he inform the House what negotiations Bord Fáilte, the main tourism promotion company for this country, have been involved in with Northern Ireland?  Is he aware of a statement made by the chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board that he was very disappointed with the co-operation his board in Northern Ireland were receiving from Bord Fáilte?  It was very damaging at an international conference and I would like the Minister to comment on the issue.</P>

They are also involved on a day to day basis in implementing the International Fund for Ireland projects that are decided on. In that regard there are meetings every six weeks.  Some £38.5 million has already been allocated under the International Fund for Ireland and Bord Fáilte are involved in that process on a day to day basis.  I have already briefed the Deputy on the Anglo Irish Conference initiative which I took last July.  In regard to the statement from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, I have seen that statement. I do not agree with it.  Although I do not have the reference, I understand that the chairman backed off that criticism somewhat at a later venue.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>the reason Ireland did not ask for assistance from the EC for its rail network in view of the fact that Spain, Greece, Portugal and Northern Ireland did apply for assistance from funds.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 20 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has sought and secured EC financial assistance for the development of its national rail network from both the European Regional Development Fund and the Transport Infrastructure Fund. The rail network will receive the bulk of the European Regional Development Fund funding allocated to public transport in the Operational Programme on Peripherality.  The total amount of such aid in the period 1991 to 1993 will be about £18 million.  Listed projects include the extension of the existing rail freight link within Dublin Port, and the provision of new rail freight gantries at Cork, Dundalk, Limerick and Sligo.  In addition, funding has been set aside to provide a commuter rail link between Clondalkin and the city centre.  However, the availability of EC aid for the Clondalkin project has been made conditional on the outcome of a socio-economic cost benefit analysis of the proposed investment.  This analysis is under way at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated in previous replies, the Operational Programme on Peripherality provides for a detailed study of the costs and benefits of the proposed upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast rail link to be carried out jointly by my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment and the European Commission.  The purpose of this three-way study is to complete a full assessment of the project's potential contribution to the improvement of passenger and freight services within the island as a whole, with the possibilities for EC assistance for the project being examined in the light of the outcome of the study.  In that regard, and as a result of my efforts at meetings of the EC Committee of Transport Ministers, I have been able to secure a commitment for setting aside financial assistance for the improvement of the Dublin-Belfast link <Col N="756" /> under the EC's newly established Transport Infrastructure Fund.  Consultants have been engaged to carry out an assessment of the Dublin-Belfast line and it is expected that their report will be submitted shortly.</P>
    <P>The Dublin-Belfast line has also been discussed at meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference where it was agreed that the possibility of securing EC aid for the project would be pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that under the EC peripherality programme less than 5p in every £1 is being spent on railways?  Is he further aware that Northern Ireland railways are prepared to spend their share of the cost of upgrading the line and that there is a sense of outrage in Northern Ireland at the neglectful way this Government have not given a commitment to fund this vital cross-Border link?  Will he now give a commitment that the Government will fund this route when the report is completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have that 5p in the £1 figure and I thank the Deputy for that bit of research.  Secondly, I am not aware of outrage in Northern Ireland. The Government are fully committed, subject to this three-way study between the Commission, the Northern Ireland Department and my own Department, to the upgrading of the Belfast-Dublin line. We are talking about a £70 million project and we are proceeding here in a logical way to have it studied by the three of us including, I would emphasise, the Commission, to see whether we can arrange to have it funded with EC support.  I have pointed out in my reply that the transport infrastructure fund would be my main target for EC funding and I am confident we can make substantial progress there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from what the Minister has said that in the 1992 Public Capital Programme there will be Exchequer support for the minimum £40 million which is necessary on the Republic side for this route?  Can the Minister now give a commitment to the <Col N="757" /> House that the work on this project will commence next year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>On the basis of the limited amount of information supplied to us by the Minister &mdash; I appreciate that a tabular statement is being circulated &mdash; may I ask whether the amount of money to Bord Fáilte was increased by a few million pounds each year for five years as promised in the programme set out by this Government in 1987, we would now be in a position to say that tourist numbers this year would be increasing by a substantial number?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think you can say that if you spend proportionately more you will get an exactly proportionate increase in visitor numbers. The reciprocal question would be whether, if we did not have Bord Fáilte and did not have marketing we would not have visitors either.  Obviously, the answer to that question is that we would have some visitors.  The direct relationship between the pound spent by Bord Fáilte and the visitor numbers is not a clear line, it is a dotted line.</P>

      <P>I did not see the statement to which the Deputy refers but I agree that Japan is an exciting area from Ireland's point of view.  The difficulty is that the bulk of the Japanese come through London.  Much of Bord Fáilte's effort is geared towards trying to get them to come onwards once they have reached the UK.  Having said that, we have not by any means sufficient resources in Japan. I would like to see us correcting that position.  It is a matter I will discuss with Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>The Minister is no <Col N="760" /> doubt aware that the CSO today produced figures stating, for the first time, that continental tourism revenue was larger than North American tourism revenue. A number of months ago in the House the Minister said he was trying to get a major American air carrier back into this country.  From the marketing point of view that would be beneficial to the country and would also help to increase the number of tourists from North America.  Has any progress been made in that area?</P>

      <P>Regretfully not Deputy, other than the fact that I have visited most of the North American airline companies at senior level; at chairmanship and executive level.  They are all extremely nervous about the aviation industry at present and are reluctant to commit themselves to 1991 and to 1992. There is a very strong interest among USA airlines in flying direct to London and this is something to which Ireland will have to give serious attention: I am giving it much attention at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Telecom Éireann were granted, by law, the exclusive privilege of providing telecommunications services within the State and the reasons for granting this exclusive privilege are set out clearly in the legislation.  I accept that any monopoly position can be abused and indeed a relatively small number of allegations of abuse of privilege have been made.  These allegations have been investigated by the Department but most of them have not been substantiated.  A code of conduct has been drawn up to ensure that all Telecom staff are aware of their responsibilities in areas where abuses might arise.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy brings to my notice any case of abuse of their exclusive privilege by Telecom Éireann I will have the allegations looked into immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that over one in three of all complaints received by the Ombudsman relate to telephone accounts?  Would the Minister further accept that the manner <Col N="762" /> in which complaints are dealt with by Telecom Éireann in relation to telephone bills would not be tolerated in respect of any commercial concern in any country where such concern did not have a monopoly? In such circumstances the operation concerned would be out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure seems to be about right, Deputy.  A very large proportion of complaints to the Ombudsman are in fact about Telecom Éireann. That is why I have come to the conclusion that some more independent structure may now be required to speed up the process of dealing with those complaints. I am looking at a few options in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that Telecom Éireann use, in my view, unethical strong arm tactics to force people to pay accounts which may not be due?  The principal tactic is the threat of disconnection which they can issue with impunity because of their monopoly position but they also use other tactics which have been drawn to my attention by members of the legal profession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to the Minister's invitation in relation to the complaints I received from the member of the legal profession and I will submit the details to him.  It seems there is a need for a telephone arbitrator who would be able to bring Telecom Éireann to heel without the threat of disconnection hanging over the head of a person who wants a complaint properly investigated. Does the Minister accept the need for such an appointment and, if so, will he take steps to establish such a position forthwith?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the options I can consider.  I have come to the conclusion, given the large number <Col N="763" /> of complaints to the Ombudsman, that there is a need for some speedy and non-bureaucratic way of dealing with these complaints, possibly with some element of Telecom involved.  I will have to try to thrash that out as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister's commitment to consider the matter, he will agree that the general public are at the mercy of Telecom Éireann when it comes to querying bills. Will the Minister agree that the only way to reassure people who feel they have been overcharged on their phone bills is in the area of technology?  The technology is in the hands of Telecom Éireann and the ordinary lay-person has no way of knowing whether their bills are correct. Will the Minister ensure that Telecom Éireann install such equipment as is necessary to prove once and for all whether consumers are being overcharged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the spirit of what the Deputy said.  If Telecom Éireann have the technology and the customer complains, he has no way of proving his point of view.  There is a metering system available at the moment but it would be inordinately expensive for every household to avail of it.  It is in that area that I am trying to find a solution as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this issue comes up about this time every year when the Ombudsman's report is published but we then forget about it until the next year?  Bearing in mind the arrogant, cavalier fashion in which the consumer is being treated by Telecom, would the Minister consider calling in the chief executive of Telecom Éireann, and their senior officials, to have a face to face discussion with them on the issues affecting the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should keep this matter in proportion.  Many suggestions are being made here.  The vast majority of consumers are dealt with fairly by <Col N="764" /> Telecom.  In a minority of cases consumers feel vulnerable because they cannot argue the point and, as Deputy Byrne said, they have no independent technology or advice available to them.  I am seeking to resolve that matter by some non-bureaucratic, slimline, speedy structure that will allow complaints to be dealt with somewhat independently of Telecom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise with the Minister the fact that Telecom Éireann are misleading the customer when they talk about investigating their complaints.  They write to the customer a standard pro-forma letter, a copy of which I have received from a complainant, telling them that the matter is being fully investigated when, as has now been detailed by the Ombudsman, no such investigation takes place.  All they do is examine the fault record and then send out the standard response.  That is utterly irresponsible and misleading behaviour on the part of a semi-State body, or, indeed, any commercial organisation.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the answer given to a similar question on 5 July 1990, columns 447 to 449, volume <Col N="765" /> No. 401, No. 2 of the Official Report for that day.</P>
      <P>The total arrears outstanding as at 31 December 1990 are estimated to be £431,123.  At this stage 13 licensees are in arrears.  Of these, four companies owe less than £1,000 and a further five owe less than £5,000.  Most of the money outstanding is the subject of agreement with the individual companies concerned and there is no reason to believe that this part of the arrears will not be paid over the next few years.</P>
      <P>The Department initiated legal action against one particularly recalcitrant payer with the intention of using experience gained in this case against other such companies.  However, before the case was heard in court, the arrears were paid in full.  The Chief State Sollicitor has been asked to initiate legal action against another company.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to collect outstanding amounts through routine follow-up action of individual cases; legal action; refusal to consider applications for consent to increase charges unless outstanding licence fees are addressed in a satisfactory way and refusal to consent to the transfer of licences unless my Department are also satisfied with regard to outstanding licence fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there has been no great improvement in the position since 5 July, almost a year ago?  At that stage the amount outstanding was £500,000 and it is now £431,000 which is a modest improvement. Given the needs of RTE for funding they should not be satisfied with the method by which the funds are being collected.  Will the Minister do all in his power to guarantee that the remaining £431,000 is collected immediately as against payment being phased over two to three years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be confusing the matter.  We are talking about licence fees owed by television cable companies and not about television licence fees.  On this subject I would say to Deputy Byrne that 75 per cent of the £431,000 is owed by one company and we have now reached an agreement that the money will be paid over three years. My advice is that that is the best that can be achieved.</P>

We have narrowed the problem to one company in particular and an agreement has been reached on a professional basis with that company.  However, if the House feels the matter should be considered again I will certainly agree to do so, but my advice at this time is that that is the best deal that can be achieved.</P>

It is the consumer who is being given a raw deal.  As has been said, the Minister is giving an interest free subsidy to the company, and indeed the company should be named in the House.  Any interest due should be forthcoming.  Will the Minister agree that any interest which would have accrued on the money still outstanding will be made good by this company?</P>

    <P>One of the major objectives of my proposals will be to improve the levels and quality of bus services available to the general public and to introduce competition in the bus industry on a sensible <Col N="768" /> and orderly basis.

When does the Minister expect the legislation to be operative?

I have held it back on more than one occasion so that I could consult further with CIE, some trade union interests and other transport interests.  As a result of this, better legislation will be introduced.  I cannot give details because the Government have not yet fully considered it but its core and philosophy will be my intention to introduce competition to the bus business and to end the monopoly which one company have in the marketplace.</P>

      <P>I cannot tell the Deputy at this stage whether my Department or a licensing authority will issue licences.  The Deputy should wait until the legislation is published; I do not think he will be disappointed when he sees it. I have been seeking to establish transparency &mdash; the Deputy could probably make a list of uneconomic routes in his own county &mdash; and it is my intention to ensure, as this new system develops, that there will be full transparency so that there will not be cross-subsidisation or anything like that.</P>

      <P>An Post have informed me that work on this project commenced in July last year with the removal of the statues which had aged very badly and required major repairs. Following discussions between An Post and the Office of Public Works it has been decided to replace these statues with cast replicas.  The future of the original statues has yet to be resolved.  Works are currently in progress on the portico and the restoration of the north facade to O'Connell Street.  This work is scheduled to be completed shortly.  The next stage will be <Col N="771" /> commencement of work on the replacement of the arch stone to the south portico and the restoration of the south facade.</P>
      <P>The Government allocated £500,000 in 1990 and a further £1 million in 1991 from national lottery funds for the project.  As the completion of the full project will depend on the availability of additional financial resources, it is not possible at this stage to indicate when the whole project will be completed.</P>

      <P>It is not the first time there has been a question in this regard.  As the GPO is of such historical importance it should not be dependent on lottery funds to ensure that the restoration work is carried out expeditiously.  A sum of £500,000 was allocated last year and a sum of £1 million this year.  The Minister said that the completion of the full project will depend on the availability of additional financial resources to what should be, essentially, a national shrine.  It is an insult to the men who sacrificed their lives in declaring the Proclamation outside the GPO that we now depend on the national lottery to fund it; it is an absolute disgrace.</P>

      <P>Under a Commission of the European Community decision of 22 October 1987, Ireland qualified for 50 million ECUs, or £38.8 million under the STAR Programme &mdash; the Special Telecommunications Action for Regional Development.  In the period 1987 to date, £27.4 million has been drawn down, of which £5.2 million was drawn down in 1991; the balance remaining, £11.4 million, will be drawn down before the end of the programme in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approved projects under the STAR Programme will contribute substantially towards the provision of the national infrastructure required to make advanced telecommunications services available to business enterprises thereby enabling them to operate successfully from most parts of the country, and not only from Dublin.  When completed, the projects will also provide the structure for integration of the national digital <Col N="773" /> transmission network into the new advanced networks being set up across Europe and enable Irish enterprise to compete on an equal footing with their counterparts from countries in the highly industrialised core regions of the Community.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the provisions of the Radio and Television Act, 1988 are adequate to provide for the establishment of community radio stations; if, in view of the fact that no such stations have yet been established, he will consider amending the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Section 4 of the Radio and Television Act, 1988 specifies that it shall be a function of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to arrange for the provision of sound broadcasting services, including a national sound broadcasting service additional to the broadcasting services provided by Radio Telefís Éireann.  It is not my intention to amend the Act at this stage.</P>
      <P>My function as regards issuing the licences to the commission will not arise until the commission is in a position to enter into contracts for the provision of community services.  It is clearly and statutorily a function of the Commission to bring the matter to that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there are at least ten groups in Dublin who are keen to provide local radio services and that it is unsatisfactory that the IRTC should have said to them that they had to investigate the way the <Col N="774" /> system operates in Europe?  Is it the Minister's intention to allow local radio stations in the Dublin area to be licensed as it has been consistently pointed out that they would pose no threat to the commercial stations which have already been established?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the proposed community radio stations.  I am sympathetic towards local groups who wish to press ahead and provide such services as soon as possible but the Deputy is conscious of the fact that it is a matter for the IRTC to decide on the timing and pace at which that development should proceed.  They have informed me that they are studying the way the system works in other countries and are somewhat concerned about the effect community radio services would have on the existing commercial stations many of whom &mdash; without putting a tooth in it &mdash; are having a difficult time.  I will draw the Deputy's comments to the attention of the IRTC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response is disturbing.  I did not think when the legislation was introduced that it would all depend on whether the commercial stations would be successful.  To my knowledge, no licence has been granted by the commission to date.  Does the Minister not think that it is high time he informed the chairman of the commission to go about the job entrusted to him and issue some licences?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>I discussed this matter with the IRTC as recently as yesterday and I understand that their studies, which have taken them to the United Kingdom and other parts of the Community, are nearing a conclusion and that within a matter of weeks they should be in a position to study the results and make a decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

Would he not accept that <Col N="775" /> they would provide entirely different services and operate in entirely different ways, that there is no connection?  Would the Minister not agree that it appears that the commission are thinking along the lines that there is a connection and that the matter should be clarified in the interests of those community groups who have been seeking licences to provide community radio services for some considerable time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands me.  I said I am sympathetic towards those groups who wish to establish community radio services. I think the IRTC are behaving very sensibly in studying the way the system operates in other countries.

      <P>On Thursday last, with 15 minutes notice, the House gave the Minister for the Environment 25 minutes to wind up a debate by way of a motion which had not previously been provided for.  Therefore, it is not open to the Taoiseach to suggest that this is not a matter for him.  If the Whips and this House agrees, we can order our business accordingly. There is nothing to stop the Government Whip signalling agreement now to take this debate at 7 p.m. this evening, with the kind permission of the Labour Party who will make the time available.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, on this side of the House all we wish to do is have the issues resolved.  New issues arose yesterday evening &mdash; I am coming to the point of order now.  The Chair is quite correct in saying that matters relating to this company have been debated previously.  I do not disagree with the Chair saying that.  The point is, and I do not know whether the Chair saw the programme last evening, new issues containing major allegations arose.  It is in the interests of democracy in this House that those matters that are being discussed throughout the length and breadth of this country and in Europe be debated in this House.  To muzzle this House is to bring it into disrepute.  I know that is not the Chair's intention and I am not suggesting it is.  I am merely suggesting the Chair may not appreciate the urgency of the motion under Standing Order 30, if the Chair did not have the opportunity of seeing the programme.</P>

      <P>I understand the programme ranged over EC matters, customs matters, financial matters and various other matters, so I believe it would be only commonsense that the Government would have time to prepare as full as possible a brief on these matters for the House.  My suggestion is that the Government would be prepared to make a limited amount of Government time available tomorrow which, if necessary, could be added to Private Members' time, and the Whips could meet to see how best that can be arranged.</P>

In view of the number of amendments that are before us, in view of the lost time and in view of the time that will be taken out of our time tomorrow, I would ask the Government Whip whether he would withdraw the motion and allow it to be discussed again by the Whips?  I put it sincerely to the Taoiseach, and the Government Chief Whip, that this Bill will be the better if we have a chance to debate the 300 amendments before the House.</P>

      <P>We will be resisting this motion strongly.  We think it is grossly wrong that the Government should seek at such short notice to put through a Bill which provides the Minister for the Environment with so much power and which he, and the Minister for Energy, clearly have misread, so much so that they have to concede some small number of amendments to put right what they said was in the Bill in the first place and which was not.  The precedent being followed here is a dangerous one.  It is built on the fact that by agreement from time to time Standing Orders are ignored and things are done notwithstanding Standing Orders.  Sir, never should you tolerate motions which ignore Standing Orders and which have the support of only one side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, it helps to focus on them.  My first amendment is related to the very last one.  It is significant that there are almost 300 amendments to this legislation.  Last week Members on the Opposition benches said it was imperative to put the Bill under close scrutiny.  Most of us have done that to the best of our ability, given the time constraints imposed by the guillotine motions passed here, and have endeavoured to discuss this matter with outside interests and with those who have a general regard to local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be thought that this amendment is not of great moment or substance but it is important to underscore that, while the Bill purports to reform local government, in fact it gives a whole range <Col N="912" /> of powers to enable the Minister to bring about changes in local government which should be recognised in the provisions of the Bill.  That is why I seek to insert in the name of the Bill that the Bill is regarded as the Local Government (Enabling Provisions) Bill, 1991 and, therefore, that the Title of the Bill, in accordance with amendment No. 298 would read: &ldquo;a Bill to amend and extend the law relating to local government and to enable the Minister for the Environment to effect certain reforms&rdquo;, because that is what it does.  This Bill is not, of its nature, reforming although it purports to be.  Those of us who read it last Thursday week felt, at first glance, that it did not go far enough but the more opportunity I had to look at it the clearer it became to me that what in essence is attempting to be done in this Bill is to devolve not to local authorities but directly to the Minister himself a whole range of powers which, in many ways, delimits the powers of local government.</P>
    <P>In many ways the Minister has asked us to make an act of faith in him that the powers he is taking upon himself will, at some future date, be devolved downwards. However, that is not in the Bill. We have been asked in the Bill &mdash; and we will deal with issue by issue as they arise &mdash; to vest new and sometimes worrying powers in the Minister.  At the outset, it should be recognised that the Bill simply enables the Minister to take to himself new powers which should be recognised in the Title and description of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Howlin has gone far enough in his comments. I do not have a problem in supporting his amendment but he is far too kind to the Minister in saying that he is taking enabling powers.  The reality is that the Minister is taking extensive powers and any one of us who have been in Government will know that those powers are almost certain to be used.  They come under several different headings.  The Bill starts with the definitions section which defines the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo;, which <Col N="913" /> means prescribed by the Minister for the Environment.  The word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; appears many times throughout the Bill. There are regulations, the vast majority of which will never come before this or the other House; there are orders, the vast majority of which will never come before this or the other House, regardless of whether we on this side of the House table a motion within 21 sitting days to reject them.  The Government order the business of the House and can prevent, as they have done in the past, motions to reject regulations or orders being debated in the House within 21 sitting days.  In addition to prescriptions, regulations and orders, reference is also made in the Bill to directions.  This is a recipe for clogging up local government even more.  The Minister wants the power to make regulations in relation to twinning, the expenses of chairmen and civic honours for which provision has been made in statutes dating back over 100 years.  He wants to intervene and have the power to direct, prescribe, regulate or order but this is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>There is one fundamental defect in the proposals before the House.  They do not address how local authorities should be funded.  We are all aware of the Minister's record in this respect.  We are aware that he has cut the amount available to the local authorities during his four years in office.  We are also aware that it is he who decides, not the local councils who are answerable to local people, which projects should receive national lottery funding, even if only a small grant is to be paid to a small project.  That will continue to be the position under this Bill.  Indeed, he will now have the power to give directions and prescriptions and make orders and regulations in relation to a far greater number of matters than heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a local government reform Bill at all; it is a centralisation of power Bill because there is no way in which the Minister will be able to delegate, in a meaningful way, extra functions or roles to the local authorities unless he delegates a role or gives discretion to local authorities in relation to funding.  We <Col N="914" /> should be clear in discussing the first amendment to the Bill &mdash; which seeks to change the title of the Bill from the Local Government Bill to the Local Government (Enabling Provisions) Bill &mdash; that the only person who will be enabled to do anything is the Minister for the Environment. He will be enabled to dictate, control, stifle or clog up local government even more.  No vigour will be returned to the local authorities under this Bill as urged by the Minister's own expert committee and many others.  There will be stagnation.  What we need is the liberation of the local authorities from the Minister's dead hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer at the outset of this two day Committee Stage debate to the fact that 300 amendments have been submitted.  At a rough calculation, we will have, on average, three minutes to discuss each amendment. This means in all probability that the bulk of the amendments and most of the section and Parts of the Bill will not be debated.  That is extremely serious because, as has been said, not only will the Bill transfer to the Minister for the Environment the powers of the local authorities, it will also transfer the powers of this House in relation to local government.  What the Bill is saying to the Minister, effectively, is: here is the legislation, reorganise local government.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill the Minister will be able to make regulations to establish regional authorities, to decide on the membership of those authorities, and how they should relate to other bodies.  He will also be able to decide when the sub-county structures will be established and when, if ever, there will be elections to those sub-county structures having regard to the fact that he will have the power to postpone indefinitely urban council and town commissioner elections.  No date has been set for elections to those bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will transfer to the Minister the power to decide what functions, if any, should be given or devolved to local authorities.  Where new functions for local authorities are proposed they are circumscribed by a qualification that the <Col N="915" /> Minister for the Environment will be able to make regulations.  It is our experience where legislation which enables the Minister to make regulations has been passed, it might be many a long day before the regulations see the light of day.  Where, for example, are the building control regulations which were supposed to be made under the Building Control Act which passed through the House over a year ago?  We are still waiting for them.</P>
    <P>It takes Ministers, and this Minister in particular, a very long time to produce regulations on anything.  Therefore this Bill, which will allow the Minister to make regulations to reform local government, leaves me in a state of despair as to when, if ever, regulations dealing with the sub-county structures and boundaries the establishment of regional authorities, and so on, will ever see the light of day. What is even worse, it will prevent us from debating these matters in the House again.  Regulations are not brought before the House.  Indeed, we cannot even ask on the Order of Business when regulations will be published and brought before the House.  Not only will this Bill undermine local government and transfer the powers of local authorities to the Minister for the Environment, it will also transfer to him the rights of this House to decide on the structure of local government in the future.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with the amendment to the Title although if I had a choice there are many Titles we could use &mdash; the Centralisation of Government Bill, the Central Government Bill, the Undermining of Local Government Bill &mdash; other than the one proposed by Deputy Howlin, but his proposal certainly describes the Bill more accurately than the Minister's.  While I can agree with an amendment which seeks to change the Title of the Bill, I am fundamentally opposed to a Bill which will enable the Minister to reform local government.</P>
    <P>The question of the establishment of structures and the reform of local government are matters that should be debated in this House.  I refer to the situation in Dublin, in particular.  The Bill proposes <Col N="916" /> the estabishment of three area committees corresponding to the existing district committees of Dublin County Council.  In a throwaway remark in the course of his Second Stage speech, the Minister referred to the possible boundaries of the area committees, if they were ever constituted, as county councils in their own right.  I do not think this is a matter which should be left to the discretion of the Minister for the Environment, whoever he might be.  The matter should be debated in this House so that the elected Members have an opportunity of discussing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I interrupt in order to be helpful.  The Deputy has indicated that time is not as plentiful as the House would wish.  I think we would all be the better if we would confine ourselves to what is specifically relevant to the amendments.  Deputy Gilmore is moving towards a Second Stage contribution rather than confining himself to the matter under discussion. There are many sections where different matters will be dealt with and if we make appropriate contributions on each amendment and on each section, the end product will be the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was moving to the conclusions of my remarks.  One newspaper commentator in the course of the weekend referred to the Minister's superior knowledge.  I think it is worth putting on record:</P>
      <P>The Opposition devoted lengthy criticism to apparent flaws which the Minister, with his superior knowledge and expert advisers, easily countered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what the Minister did &mdash; by and large he ignored what the expert advisers had to say.  I suppose the quality newspapers use the phrase &ldquo;superior knowledge&rdquo; as a way of saying &ldquo;the Minister knows best&rdquo;.  It is an apt enough phrase because, effectively, the Minister is asking us to leave it up to him, the Minister knows best and the Minister, with his superior knowledge will decide on the future structures of local government.  I <Col N="917" /> do not think that is the way we should deal with the question of local government reform.  It should be debated in detail in this House but, unfortunately, we are not going to be given the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree fundamentally with the previous speakers.  I am convinced that the Minister is introducing a process of real reform of local government. I have some experience of a county council that is too big and I am sure Deputy Gilmore shares my view that it is unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time three new councils were promised and I would have been a member of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council.  The Minister is introducing a Bill which will initiate this process. It has taken years to reform local government in other countries and people should remember that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>If we do not make a start some time, we will never see any real reform.  The Bill has come through expert committees, Cabinet sub-committees and there is a broad framework for reform.  Quite frankly, I cannot see any other way of dealing with this issue except that you begin by setting up structures, systems and functions and, quite rightly, the funding will fit into the structures in due course.  In 1985 we were all re-elected, those of us who were on Dublin County Council, to councils of Fingal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Belgard, but nothing happened.  The system is grinding to a halt.  The Bill provides us with real opportunities.  There is provision for three new statutory committees and Dublin County Council will be <Col N="918" /> required to delegate functions to area councils and each area will have an area manager.  The area managers will consult the area committees and then they will bring forward a joint report on the establishment of new councils.  The Minister is putting the whole system together and it deals with the transfer of assets and staff. There is an innuendo that there is something wrong with this.  There will be consultations with the trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> The Government are involved in consultations with the social partners.  I can only presume that this type of consultation will continue.  We are living in an era of consultation with the social partners and surely when the processes are established, the Bill will fit quite comfortably within that structure.</P>
      <P>I believe games are being played at this early stage.  Something in the order of 298 amendments have been tabled and we should move on to some of the more substantial elements of this legislation.</P>

      <P>Unlike Deputies Gilmore and Kitt I did not have the opportunity of making a Second Stage speech and I do not intend to do so now. I will confine my remarks to the amendment under discussion.  The amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;enabling provisions&rdquo; into the Title.  I have no quibble with that.  We might as well call a spade a spade.  This Bill will enable the Minister to do what he likes.  I do not agree that the Minister should be allowed to do what he likes but the Title of the Bill should reflect the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not be allowed do what he likes; once bitten twice shy.  I would not like to give the Minister a free hand in local government.  The Bill proposes to transfer the power from the Oireachtas to the Minister and we must realise that.  If this Bill is passed, the Minister, or future Minister, will have the enabling power to reform local <Col N="919" /> government.  That is not the way it should be.  As soon as the local elections are over and members of the Minister's party have overcome the shock of meeting the electorate will rates on houses be brought back or will we have a property tax or a tax by a name that the Minister proposes to give it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill enables the Minister to do that and I would not have much confidence in him.  The Minister will not do anything to upset people before 27 June but I have great fears of what might happen after that.  We might as well call it the &ldquo;enabling provisions&rdquo; Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kitt has said that games are being played but if games are being played, they are being played by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that people who were expected to give an informed opinion on the Bill received the explanatory memorandum on the day the Bill was presented.  It was intentional that information be delayed so that the Minister would be able to slip through proposals without us being properly informed of them until it was too late.</P>
      <P>This provision will strangle local authorities. From his performance up to now, the Minister cannot be trusted with extra powers.  What he has done with national lottery funds is disgraceful.  He has failed to give local authorities the flexibility to spent their block grants as they see fit. Letters about the use of national lottery funds are like confetti, they are all over the place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The inclusion of the words proposed in Deputy Howlin's amendment in the Long and Short Titles of the Bill is unnecessary.  I agree with Deputy Howlin that the amendment is not of great substance.  This is a Local Government Bill and there have been more than 20 Local Government Acts.  The Title &ldquo;An Act to amend and extend the law relating to Local Government&rdquo; describes exactly what the Bill will do.  I hope the Deputy does not intend to press his amendment which, as he rightly said, is not a substantive amendment.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains provisions which are not enabling provisions and have effect directly from the legislation.  It is important to remember that.  I want to give a few examples of these provisions &mdash; the postponement of elections, the change in regard to section 4 motions, the disqualification of Ministers from local authority membership and the continuation in office of certain members of harbour boards and VECs.  The Short Title is meant to be short and introducing the words &ldquo;enabling provisions&rdquo; would be a misnomer.  This, of course, begs the question why other descriptions of the Bill should not be included in the Title. This would lead us well away from the idea of the Short Title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Deputy Mitchell raised some other points which are not properly before us at this time, he did make the point about clogging-up local government by regulations.  I found that an extraordinary opening remark from Deputy Mitchell; although maybe not so extraordinary when one considers his lack of understanding of some of the fundamentals of this legislation.  I want to point out to Deputy Mitchell that Deputy <Col N="921" /> Howlin proposes in amendment No. 13 that every regulation must be laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas.  I ask the Deputy, who wants to clog up the system?  The proposal in Deputy Howlin's amendment will do exactly what Deputy Mitchell spoke about &mdash; it will clog up the system.</P>

If the Minister feels he is entitled to make a passing reference to something which has already been mentioned, I could not deny him that right.  I hope that once we have dealt with this amendment no Deputy will give anyone else the opportunity to be out of order.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to detain the House too long on this amendment, but as the Deputies referred to the regulations, I felt I should point out that under section 3 (4) the regulations will, of course, be laid before each House and any Deputy can challenge any regulation in this House.  How many Deputies ever attempted to challenge regulations in this <Col N="922" /> House during the past couple of years?  I cannot remember.  How many of them can cite even one example of an improper use of the power to make a regulation? It cannot be done.  Why are the Deputies talking about things which have no substance and are inaccurate?</P>
      <P>This is real reforming legislation and the Opposition in a strange, convoluted way accept this.  In fact, Deputy Gilmore went so far as to tell me to reform local government, which is precisely what I am attempting to do.</P>

      <P>While I said that this amendment was not of great substance &mdash; it deals with the Title to the Bill and I want to get on to more meaty points quickly &mdash; it is important that book is given an accurate title, the name of a book should reflect what is in it.  This Bill purports to be reforming legislation but it is clearly not that, and I think the Minister has begun to realise this over the past few days.  I want the reality of the Bill to be reflected in its Short and Long Titles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has teased us to respond to a number of extraneous matters and apart from making one important comment I shall do my best to restrain myself. During my first term as a Member of the Oireachtas I served on the committee which dealt with legislation and which <Col N="923" /> took as one of its duties the duty to monitor and look at Statutory Instruments. The committee was abolished together with many other committees.  It is very important that there would be a monitoring committee of this House who would look at the huge volume of legislation which is enforced by <i>fiat</i>, direct order of the Minister, and which is not subject to public scrutiny.  There is grave cause for concern among the electorate and the elected Members of this House in relation to more and more powers being given to Ministers to act outside the scope of this House and to put into legislation important measures by way of Statutory Instruments.  I hope we can have a monitoring procedure in regard to such issues. I believe the amendment is important enough to be put to the House.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (10), line 6, after &ldquo;days&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(being a day or days not later than twelve months from the date of its enactment)&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment also deals with the framework of the Bill.  It is important to know when the provisions of the Bill will come into effect.  Under section 1 (10) the Minister gives himself the power to fix the day or days on which this Bill will become law &ldquo;either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different provisions and for the repeal and revocation effected by <i>section 4</i> of different enactments&rdquo;.  I have acknowledged on national radio that, even though they are few and far between, there are welcome provisions in the Bill, unfortunately in many cases prescribed by the Minister, but I hope we can improve on that as we debate the Bill.  The Labour Party believe that whatever is to be done should be done within a reasonable time frame.  My amendment seeks to include in subsection (10) the words &ldquo;being a day or <Col N="924" /> days not later than twelve months from the date of its enactment&rdquo; so that the Minister will have the responsibility to act on the measures he has lauded over the last ten days.  There are many provisions in this Bill which may never see the light of day.  Deputy Kitt already referred to the creation of three independent county councils for the county of Dublin.  These county councils have existed since the last local elections as committees.  The provisions of this Bill will maintain them as committees.  They are not being made into statutory county councils on enactment of this legislation. It is possible that they will be long-fingered forever.  That is one of the many issues in this Bill that will not automatically come into force when this Bill is enacted.  Many of the parts will come into operation at the discretion of the Minister and they may never see the light of day.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party want to add to the number of Bills and enactments that are annulled by this provision.  We want to know that if the provision to impose domestic charges is carried in this House, it will come into effect within a reasonable time.  In relation to the monitoring of enabling powers, the democratic assembly must have control over when and how these provisions become applicable as the law of the land.  That should not be left to the discretion of one individual. We can all instance laws which are ignored although theoretically they are binding, but it would be far worse to have provisions enacted here and left to gather dust on the shelf.  There is no reasonable argument against the provisions of this Bill coming into effect within a period of 12 months which is surely enough time for the Government and the Minister to bring into effect the modest contents of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment deals with the question of times.  I support the amendment although I have mixed feelings in two respects.  There are aspects of this Bill that I would like never to come into effect, much less have brought into effect within 12 months.  On the other <Col N="925" /> hand there are some aspects of the Bill I would like to see brought into effect immediately, for example, amendments proposed to section 4 in relation to material contravention procedures.  Will the Minister indicate when he proposes to bring these changes into effect.  If it was to take a year, within the space of a year I could see Fianna Fáil members of Dublin County Council rezoning on average 30 or 40 material contraventions. The record over the last six years shows that provision for about 4,000 houses was rezoned since the last local elections. Deputy Kitt, who is now advising the Minister will be able to inform him about that.  I would not like there to be a delay between the enactment of these measures and their being brought into effect because the practice in Dublin County Council has been that when there is a deadline, local elections or whatever, there is a big push to rush through material contraventions.  I would hate a similar situation to develop if there was a delay in the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister commit himself as to when we will see the sub-county structures? How much longer will the people of the towns of this country be denied a vote?  They already have urban councils and town commissioners which are in place for six years and which are now proposed to be continued indefinitely. When does the Minister propose to have the sub-county structures put in place? Can the Minister give us some indication of the timescale in relation to regional authorities, in relation to the proposals for Dublin and in relation to the devolution of any powers from central Government. It would help the rest of the debate if the Minister gave us some indication as to the timescale he envisages for these provisions coming into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment in the name of Deputy Howlin is like the curate's egg, good in parts but bad in parts and I will not support it.  There are several orders, regulations and directions permitted by the section which relates to his amendment, which I do not want to see brought in.  I do not want to force the <Col N="926" /> Minister to do something within the next 12 months which I do not want him to do at all.  That would be the effect of Deputy Howlin's amendment.</P>
      <P>When we come to the subsection I will strongly oppose it because it gives the Minister extraordinary extensive powers. It says:</P>
      <P>This Act shall come into operation on such day or days, as by order or orders...either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different provisions and for the repeal or revocation effected by section 4 of different enactments. </P>
      <P>This subsection gives the Minister extraordinary powers even to change legislation enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Deputy Gilmore made a case in relation to section 4s.  The provisions of this Bill should have effect from the date of the publication of the Bill and any motion tabled after that date should be subject to the provisions of this Bill.  I am as committed as anyone else to getting rid of abuses under section 4.  At the same time I am concerned because we are further eroding the power of councils, and thus the power of local people, to influence events around them.  There is an implication that the only people capable of wrongdoing or capable of being wrongly influenced are elected representatives. We know that it is officials both at central and local level who have a much greater role and much more power in relation to planning matters.  Only a fool would believe that officials are above making wrongful decisions or being wrongfully influenced.  The general view of the House is that we have to do something about abuses under section 4. The effect of what is proposed will restrict councillors in planning matters but it could very well facilitate greater bureaucratic abuse.  That is not something which the House wants to achieve.  For those reasons I will not support the amendment of Deputy Howlin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what the <Col N="927" /> Fine Gael spokesperson said on this section.  It allows the Minister to fix a day when the Bill will become law.  It is essential that that date be spelt out.  I do not want to see several parts of the Bill passed into law, but the good parts of it have to be taken with the bad parts.  If the Bill is to be passed into law, as it will be, that date should be named.  The provision allows the Minister to fix the date.  I would not have great confidence in allowing the Minister to become involved in the fixing of dates, but if he has to fix the date then that should be when the Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>The Bill make provisions concerning local charges.  Can the Minister also fix dates when changes in local charges will come into force?</P>
      <P>It is essential that the proposed, or supposed, reform of section 4 motions should come into force immediately rather than leaving a valley period which could result in people being tempted to use such motions more than necessary.  In his Second Stage speech my constituency colleague, Deputy Molloy, the Minister for Energy, made great play of the part played by the Progressive Democrats in that matter.  He claimed credit for any reform of section 4 motions for his party.  He made a very hypocritical speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>He was the only person to introduce a section 4 motion at corporation level in Galway.  He supported and used many of them at Galway County Council level.  The Deputy spent half an hour lecturing our spokesperson, and everybody else, on what be described as our hypocrisy in relation to the Bill, yet his speech was the most hypocritical I have ever heard in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Energy said his party would have gone further and would not have allowed Deputies to stand for local authorities.  However, he, as a Minister, has stayed for two years as a member of <Col N="928" /> not only one local authority but two local authorities in my county, Galway Corporation and Galway County Council. He is also a member of several sub-committes of those local authorities.  Despite my valiant efforts to get that Minister to see the light of day and resign from those local authorities, he had the audacity to come into the Chamber on Second Stage and say that the Progressive Democrats would have gone further than the Minister and would not have allowed Deputies to stand for local authorities.  Deputy Molloy, still has 28 days or so to resign from the local authorities.  He should not come into the House to try to fool the people.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have digressed from the amendment being discussed.  I got a little carried away on the issue although I did not mean to.  The dates should be set quickly.  The House should not allow a long period to elapse because that would be a very dangerous procedure.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of what my colleague, the Minister for Energy, did when he was Minister for Local Government at the time of the 1973 election and when it was obvious that his party were losing power and that there would be a new Government. That was before the time of section 4 motions and the setting up of the planning appeals system.  He dealt with numerous planning applications in the three weeks from the time the Dáil fell and the new Government were elected. How can he talk about the hypocrisy of this side of the House in our contributions to this debate?  I wish I had an opportunity to speak about that on Second Stage, because I do not want to abuse Committee Stage by putting those matters on the record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I applaud my colleague, Deputy McCormack, but I shall not stray as far as he did.  I too, have serious reservations about the way in which the section is framed.  I do not entirely agree with Deputy Howlin's amendment but I <Col N="929" /> can understand why he feels concerned. I can think of a number of precedents elsewhere in legislation, not the least of them being the Criminal Justice Act, 1985.  That Act contained a number of parts that came into operation at different times under conditions that had been specified in the Act.  The Bill before the House is exactly the same kind of legislation, in that it is composed of a series of different parts that provide for a number of different measures in relation to local authorities, some of which clearly cannot be carried out immediately because much preparatory work has to be done.</P>
      <P>The Bill could quite reasonably provide in some or all of those parts that when a certain number of measures have been accomplished that part would come into operation.  It would be much wiser to proceed in that way than to give the Minister the very general power he has in the section.  I am convinced further in that view by considering the number of provisions in the Bill that propose to give the Minister a series of different powers. With the exception of Part I, which is purely procedural, no part of the Bill does not give the Minister power to make provisions by order or by regulation. Those provisions are excessive, and I shall return to that matter when section 3 is being considered.  All of that simply reinforces the case for a much more systematic approach to the implementation of the provisions of the Bill and changing section 1 (10).</P>
      <P>I do not entirely agree with the amendment proposed by Deputy Howlin; I agree with my colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, on that matter.  Consideration should be given to bringing more certainty, more predictability, and more conditionality into the implementation of the different parts of the Bill.  I urge the Minister, who has already shown a small degree of openness, in one respect at least, to consider the matter between now and Report Stage and introduce more clarity and predictability into the Bill by amending section 1 (10).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to say that I am pleased that many Deputies welcome certain provisions of the Bill and that they have been generous enough to express their views at the start of Committee Stage.  The amendment is unnecessary and would have undesirable consequences, and I should like to try to convince Members about that.</P>
      <P>If a provision we would want to commence, and that everybody would agree was necessary and desirable, had not commenced within the specified period then it could not be commenced but would, in effect, lapse as it would not then be possible to commence it.  That would defeat the whole purpose of a good measure.  I intend to commence as much as possible of the Bill immediately or as soon as possible following its enactment. That would obviously be the case with electoral matters listed out in Part III.</P>
      <P>As many as possible of the new general powers will be brought into operation on the commencement of the term of office of the new councils in July.  That is what I hope for.  I shall deal with the Dublin reorganisation, contained in Part IV, and the section 4 procedures, which have been referred to later.  In other cases it will be necessary that orders or regulations be prepared.  Deputy Dukes recognised that.  They will have to be prepared, and that sometimes takes time. For example, the issues of committees and boundary alterations would, of course, take some time.  The issue of expenses for members might take even longer to resolve than the time talked about by Deputy Howlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appropriate consultations will have to be carried out in other cases, which might not enable me to pursue the matter as quickly as I might otherwise wish to.  A study group is to look at the question of changes in the reserved functions in section 41.  I have explained that at a previous time.  I would like to give that study group ample opportunity to discuss that and to go into the existing situation of reserved functions as against executive functions of the managerial acts so that whatever recommendations they could come up with would not be just rushed at <Col N="931" /> the Minister or anybody else who would seek to implement changes in that area of the reserved functions being given to elected members.</P>
    <P>A boundary committee must be appointed before the other sections can commence.  In the circumstances the amendment could not be accepted as it would simply have the effect of cancelling provisions in the Bill which, despite our best efforts, might have to be delayed in coming into operation.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Howlin would like to have it both ways.  He criticised the use of regulations to get changes made.  He wants to do it a different way.  This is not his first time articulating his attitude in this regard; he has done it in respect of several other pieces of legislation.  At least he is consistent.  He wants to criticise the use of these regulations to get changes made. Yet he criticises the fact that the Bill does not allow regulations to take the Dublin reorganisation right through to finality. Which way does he want it?  He should spell it out.  I take the view that we should certainly use regulations to make as much progress as possible in the next year to bring about the reorganisation of Dublin. I would like to pursue that matter by regulation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, dealing substantially with the setting up of three new county councils will need new legislation and it would be wrong to do that by regulation.  New legislation should and will be produced to deal effectively with that matter.  That is the clear example of my attitude in framing this.  The example I would like to suggest is that we should discriminate between matters proper to regulation and those which are proper to legislation.  This is an example of where we have got it right and I ask the Deputy to accept that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the question of section 4 motions and how quickly he would like to see this matter dealt with.  In effect that could be brought into operation immediately after the Bill becomes law.  It does not necessarily have to go beyond this June or July or any other June or July.  It could be happening <Col N="932" /> right away and it allows for that to happen.  I have already stated that I will seek to pursue that issue as quickly as possible.  I am not saying I will do it the first day but I am proposing it as an issue that we want to see brought on.  It would not be in the Bill otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell spoke about the influence of officials in planning matters. That is the reason the Minister does not want to do away with section 4 motions in their entirety.  I have always believed that we have to have a certain amount of balance between what the expert input is in planning matters and the democratic view of what is right and necessary.  I take his point about section 1 (10).  I have to say it is purely a standard matter.  I will not pursue the matter of 4,000 houses that were built because it would not be proper at this time, but I am sure there are 4,000 families who are very pleased to have their homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I would both agree that there is a need for the construction of homes, for accommodation for people.  I would dearly like to see county councils generally getting on with the review of their development plans and not persisting in seeking my support for having extensions given to them on a continuous basis.  I do not like doing that.  In the case of every application for an extension that comes before me I really sit down and consider it because I want county councils to review their development plans in the first instance. they set themselves in the first instance. Then we might not have half the material contraventions that we continually talk about in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the teasing out of this issue which, is important. At least we have drawn the Minister some way to giving commitments on the record in relation to the implementation of this Bill section by section.  It is bland to say that this is a standard provision that is slotted in, in other words, that it is left <Col N="933" /> to the discretion of the Minister.  I am opposed in principle to this being a provision blandly slotted in.  That is why I raise it here.  I am very much in agreement with the view expressed by Deputy Dukes in relation to the need for clarity and predictability.  There is also a very strong case for the phasing in of the provisions in this Bill for practical and obvious reasons.  However, they should be time scaled into the Bill.  We should know about them in advance and they should not be subject to the whim of an individual Minister without proper legislative control.  Quite frankly, I do not think it is a good argument to say in this House that they might not be done at all or that if we set 12 months and they are not done in 12 months they might fall off the table altogether so let us not put pressure on ourselves.  It is time we did put pressure on ourselves, and it is time the Custom House and the Minister put pressure on themselves to enact the provisions before us here.</P>
      <P>Some other Opposition spokespersons spoke of rejecting the amendment on the basis that there is a number of matters in the Bill they would not agree with.  I, obviously, started on that premise too. We will deal with those, and hopefully we will change the Minister's mind on them.  The ground rules should be that whatever comes to it &mdash; and we hope that it will be a better Bill when it is finished &mdash; there will be a predictable time scale that will be mapped out in a way that allows local government which is outside this House now, but looking in, to plan for itself and know where it is going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in the Minister's declaration now about the actual structures for Dublin, which were being lauded a few minutes ago by Deputy Kitt when he said that this Minister had grasped the nettle.  However, the Minister has just told us that, basically, he has not advanced one whit on the position of one of his predecessors, Deputy Liam Kavanagh.  He is setting up those three committees and the establishment of those three county councils will require a further Act.  When will we see that? <Col N="934" /> When will we see the sub-county structures? What shape will they have or are they all kicked forward another six years until the next local elections come around, now that we go through this ritual when local elections are looming? I said &mdash; and I do not want my views distorted on it &mdash; that I have a suspicion of the volume of real legislation that is enacted by way of statutory instrument. More and more legislation going through this House contains enabling provisions for the Minister and his officials to bring in important changes by way of regulation. We do not even have a monitoring committee in this House now &mdash; we used to have the old committee on legislation &mdash; to routinely bring before the elected Members what is being brought in by statutory instruments.  I am not arguing that the Minister should bring in more by way of statutory instrument or by way of regulation.  What I am arguing, lest the Minister missed the point, is that his intentions in this regard be spelled out clearly in legislation.  What does the Minister intend to do with Dublin?  He has said we need a new Bill.  Let him publish the Bill and let us have the totality of discussions in a complete framework and not hints at one thing and promises of things to come.</P>
    <P>We have a lot of work to get through so I do not want to labour this much further, but before we put the question perhaps there are other Deputies who wish to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be sure that I understood the Minister correctly.  I understood him to say a few moments ago that he envisaged further legislation for the purpose of establishing the three proposed councils in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is correct, Sir, I am very happy to have that on the record of the House.  I would also like to say, however, that so far as this Bill is concerned, if you will allow me just a little latitude, that will mean when we come, if we ever do, to dealing with that part of <Col N="935" /> the Bill that covers this, that is, Part IV, the Minister will have to think again and that we will need substantial amendments to that part.</P>
      <P>Sections 23 and 24 in particular deal in some detail with the arrangements to be made there.  If, contrary to what we have understood and in accordance with what the Minister has just said, there is to be legislation to set up these three new councils, it seems to me that most of the matters dealt with in those two sections in particular and in that Part in general should be remitted to legislation.  It is far better for this House to pass legislation to deal with these things than to have it done in the way proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to refer to the comment the Minister made about his intention to introduce further legislation to provide for the establishment of new sub-counties in Dublin.  That flatly contradicts sections 24 and 25 of the Bill as it stands which allow for the establishment of the new sub-counties by regulation, the Minister having received a report from the respective managers.  I would prefer to see the reorganisation of local government in Dublin dealt with by way of legislation.  I had hoped it would be dealt with in this legislation and one of the criticisms I had of the Bill before us is that it does not reform local government at all.  Effectively it provides for the re-establishment &mdash; renaming really &mdash; of the existing district committees of Dublin County Council as area committees and for the assignment of a separate manager for them.  The Minister himself when speaking here last year on the postponement of the local elections described that formula for Dublin as a half-baked proposal for reorganising local government in Dublin and I must say I agreed with him on that.  I think the establishment of three sub counties in Dublin in 1985 was a half-baked idea and I do not think it has improved anything in the six intervening years; in fact, the six intervening years have confirmed how half-baked and unworkable it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should explain further <Col N="936" /> what he has in mind by way of further legislation because the situation that will arise in Dublin after the local elections is that members will be elected to precisely the same authorities on 27 June as they were elected to in 1985.  The Bill before us will not change that except in a few minor respects.  The one area where there might have been some possible change is that of Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council devolving some of their powers to the area committees, but I cannot see Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council now agreeing to devolve any of their powers to area committees, given that the Minister has just announced there may be further legislation to provide for the establishment of separate counties.  The Minister's announcement about further legislation in relation to Dublin not only confirms what I have always believed, that there was no reform in this Bill in relation to Dublin, it has now put the cat among the pigeons in Dublin post-27 June.  The situation will be totally confused with people elected to the same bodies as have existed since 1985, provision in the Bill for some kind of loose devolution of power, a promise of further legislation along the way, and sections 24 and 25 of this Bill which in the meantime give the Minister power by regulation to establish bodies and decide what functions they may perform and so forth.  The situation in Dublin has been chaotic for a very long time and the Minister's announcement now, while in its own way welcome, is compounding that chaos.  He should clarify what exactly the local government situation may be after 27 June.  Half-baked it may have been in 1985 but I think the cake is in danger of getting burned.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore should read section 24 again.  It provides for regulations in relation to preparations for establishment of proposed councils.  I feel the Minister had no option but to adopt this approach.  It is a process.  It is going to be difficult to achieve for three new councils.  There is a manager.  There is a principal officer in charge of, say, the Parks Department and we have an excellent park on the south side, Marley Park.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>That comment about the unemployed is not relevant to this.  We are involved in establishing something important, significant and historic and I cannot see how the Minister could handle it in any other way.  As I understand it, the area managers will be consulting with their new committees which will have a new significance.  There is an interim period.  You must channel the committees into new, fully fledged councils. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  They will be involved in consultation and will be required to submit a joint report on preparation for the new councils.  The section Deputy Gilmore referred to relates to regulations governing preparation.  The Minister will be involved in an evolving process.  After the <Col N="938" /> elections the new committees will take on a new significance, a new meaning. There will be a gradual devolution and evolution of power within those committees. It is a very sensible way to approach it, not just for the elected members but also for the managers.  That is one area we must monitor.  Some of the principal officers in the various departments have tremendous expertise and experience on a county basis and each of the new councils will be head hunting for principal officers to be the managers of the various sections of the councils within the new area.  It has to be done this way.  You must evolve the system.  What happened the last time was a total sham.  The newly elected members felt they were getting involved in something new within the three new committees and nothing happened.  Still the agenda clogs up on a monthly basis; it is too big.  I feel this Bill is the correct approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to expand a little on what my colleague Deputy Kitt referred to.  I recommend section 24 to the Deputies who raised the question about further legislation because it is set out clearly there.  The side heading is &ldquo;Regulations in relation to preparations for establishment of proposed councils&rdquo;. That spells it out rather starkly.  The Deputies suggested the Bill provides for nothing new in Dublin as compared with the provisions of the 1985 reorganisation Act.  That is wide of the mark.  Let me state precisely what is intended here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only common factor between this legislation and the 1985 reorganisation Act is that the existing electoral counties are being used for practical convenience but with provisions for future adjustments if necessary.  The Government accept it is necessary to take definite steps now to get the process under way rather than repeat the half-hearted measures provided for in the 1985 Act.  Accordingly, as I indicated in my Second Stage speech in some detail, and it is worth reiterating, as a first step in the process of the transition to the three new county councils three statutory committees of <Col N="939" /> the new elected county council corresponding to the new county council areas will be established under the Bill after the elections, one for each of the proposed county areas and composed of the members elected to those areas. Dublin County Council will be required to delegate functions and to operate as far as possible through those committees and each will have their own area manager to be appointed through the Local Appointments Commission.  Pending this, three existing assistant managers will be assigned responsibility for the area committees, each exercising delegated functions appropriate to the area.  I stated this in my Second Stage contribution but it is worth putting it on the record again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Over a period the role of the committees will be progressively widened and the area managers after necessary consultations with their area committees are required by the Bill to submit a joint report on the preparations for the establishment of the new county councils for their three areas.  In the light of that report, the Minister will make regulations in preparation for the establishment of the three county councils, the dissolution of the present authorities and the transfer of staff, assets, liabilities and property to the new bodies.</P>
      <P>While further legislation will be required formally to abolish Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation and to establish the three new county councils, I would like to emphasise again that unlike the arrangements made in 1985, the provisions in Part IV of the Bill in relation to Dublin will not cease to have effect after the holding of the local elections.  In fact, the provisions to which I have referred will ensure that all the necessary preparatory steps connected with the structural reorganisation in Dublin can be worked out and given effect in anticipation of further legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, what the Deputy wished to happen so far as the three new county <Col N="940" /> councils are concerned is being catered for in the legislation.  I think the statutory instruments committee on which Deputy Howlin served was a Seanad Committee.</P>

I have a motion down on the agenda of the Dublin County Council &mdash; and you, a Chathaoirligh, will empathise with this &mdash; for one and a half years. It relates to the announcement by the same Minister of the setting up of the national roads authority.  I put down a motion to Dublin County Council asking what the implications were for our work on Dublin County Council.</P>

      <P>That motion is still there two years later and it is as relevant as ever because the legislation is not passed. I suppose in one way it is as well it was not taken because I would have got a nonsense of an answer.  The intent of this amendment and what is being said here must highlight for the Minister the urgency and the need to have the next piece of legislation in the House when the Dáil resumes in October so that as members of the council &mdash; I may be preempting the electorate at this stage &mdash; we do not have to give bad representation to our constituents because the structures disallow us from giving better representation.</P>

      <P>The amendment I tabled in relation to the coming into effect of this Act has certainly engendered a broad ranging and good debate.  I perceive that the restructuring of Dublin is somewhat more vague now than it was at the beginning of this debate.  It would have been helpful &mdash; I do not say it would have been impossible &mdash; if the Minister had published the other legislative provisions in relation to the restructuring of Dublin and the other sub-counties, and they could have been debated in tandem with this Bill.  If they had been published we could refer to them in the course of this debate.  Section 24 seems to put a process in place; the side note to section 24 looks like something the poor pressured Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would come up with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are hedged in so many tiers, proposals to discuss proposals. I would like to see the reality of that in clear legislative terms.  Perhaps the Minister in his final comments on this amendment would tell us when he intends <Col N="943" /> to publish the statutory enactment for the new Dublin councils and at the same time answer the other questions.  When will we see his proposals in relation to the sub-county tiers because that hinges very directly on my amendment.  If we knew the legislative proposals would be published within a reasonable time, I would withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>The debate has been much too wide ranging and has gone into the Dublin issue.  That issue is not addressed in the amendment or in the sections to which it refers, except in so far as there are provisions in the sections dealing with the Dublin reorganisation which allows the Minister, by regulation and by order to make certain changes. The sections dealing with Dublin are those with which I have least objection because something has to be done about Dublin.  I do not happen to be enamoured with the idea of three county councils, I think we have to go much further than that in Dublin to bring the local authorities nearer to the people while streamlining and co-ordinating their functions.  I wonder that my colleagues in the other parties are surprised that new legislation is required because the Minister already said that.</P>

      <P>As I understand it after 27 June members in Dublin will be elected to the same bodies as in 1985. The existing district committees will be called area committees.  The managers of those committees will prepare a report and the only function the members will have is that they will be consulted.  The report will go to the Minister who may then look for further report.  He may then make regulations about whatever preparations might be made and some time after that he will introduce legislation. It seems that that is a long way from the reorganisation of local government in Dublin that we were promised. It seems that Deputy Kitt, Deputy Owen and myself, if we are still members of Dublin County Council, will be grappling with long agenda and section 4 motions in a 78-member authority for a very long time to come.  Deputy Owen's motion and indeed my own motions, one of which has been on the agenda of Dublin County Council for a lot longer than that of Deputy Owen, will be still sitting there waiting to be attended to.  The bottom line is that this Bill does not reorganise local government in Dublin.  After 27 June there will be the same chaotic, unworkable position as has existed since 1985, and that is an absolute disgrace. Local government in Dublin has been crying out for reorganisation for a very <Col N="945" /> long time and the Minister has failed to reorganise it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `local community' means all persons normally resident in the functional area of a local authority;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This is the interpretation section of the Bill and I wish to add two new definitions to two phrases which recur repeatedly throughout the Bill but which have not been defined.  It is important that we define these two phrases in particular. Not only do they recur throughout the Bill but local government reform should revolve around the needs of the community and the persons of the local community. Before we can progress we should acknowledge that fact and try to put into the Bill a definition of each of those phrases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seek to include a definition of &ldquo;local community&rdquo; to mean all persons normally resident in the functional area of a local authority.  It seems to be an omission from the Bill that that term is not defined. The other amendment to be discussed in conjunction with this one, amendment No. 5, seeks to insert a definition of &ldquo;represents the interests of the local community&rdquo;, another phrase that recurs in the Bill.  The definition I seek to insert is worthy of teasing out.  I suggest to the Minister that &ldquo;represents the interests of the local community&rdquo; would mean &ldquo;to ascertain in a democratic manner, to reflect and to carry out the wishes of the <Col N="947" /> local community to the maximum extent feasible, subject to the rights of every citizen (including minority rights) being fully protected&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When we see the phrase &ldquo;represents the interests of the local community&rdquo; it is legitimate to ask what the Minister means by that.  There are many statements that I described on Second Stage as banal, statements that look fine, and this is one of them.  In legislation we have a responsibility to be a little more accurate than that.  This is an important focus for the Bill.  The local community should be the heart of all our considerations and therefore the two definitions are necessary.  If the Minister wishes to take issue with either one of the definitions or amend them in any way I will certainly look favourably on any suggestions he, or any other Member of the House, wishes to make.  The local community should be at the heart of this Bill and therefore they should be defined in the interpretation section of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments. There are a number of amendments tabled which make specific reference to involving the local community, particularly community organisations, in the work of local government. We have to see local government in a wider sense than simply the elected members of councils and the administrative and other staff apparatus of local authorities.  We have to arrive at a point where the consumer of local services and community organisations, whether they be residents' associations, tenants' organisations or voluntary groups, are involved in a participative way in the system of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give two examples.  Since the present Government abolished the right of NATO to negotiate a national rents scheme for local authority tenants, those tenants no longer have any say in the way in which the rents schemes for their dwellings are formulated.  We need to build into this legislation, as of right, a consultative role for bodies such as tenants' organisations.  Similarly, we need to <Col N="948" /> build in a consultative role for residents' associations where a local authority propose to carry out works in their area.  The definitions proposed by Deputy Howlin emphasise the need to steer this legislation in the direction of giving the community greater involvement and participation in local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 seeks to describe a local community as meaning all persons resident in the functional area of a local community.  In relation to the largest county &mdash; Cork &mdash; if this amendment is accepted would it mean that people in Castletownbere would be considered part of the local community in relation to an issue affecting Fermoy or Macroom, 100 miles away?  A certain amount of common sense must be applied; my understanding of local community is that it is a different thing in different places.</P>
      <P>While I welcome an attempt to define local community we will need to elaborate and to be more precise in this regard on Report Stage.  I take local community to mean the local community directly affected by an issue.  As I have repeatedly said in my comments on the Bill and in discussions on local government reform, the Fine Gael policy is to seek to return power and influence in regard to local matters and environment to local people. Let us take the proposed electoral county of South Dublin; is the area amenity order on the Liffey Valley in Lucan-Palmerstown something in relation to which people in that area should have the same say as those on the other side of the electoral county in Rathfarnham who are not interested in it?  I share Deputy Howlin's intention to involve local people in local power and influence and, to that extent, I support the spirit of the amendment which, it must be said, is in defiance of the whole spirit of the Bill, which is to remove power and influence even further from local communities when we should be seeking to do the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the principle of the amendments because at present local communities do not have the input <Col N="949" /> they should have in regard to decisions affecting their everyday life.  We have structures and sub-committees and some local authorities have community development committees which involve community and residents' associations but it is up to individual councils to decide the extent of their willingness to allow local people to become involved.</P>
      <P>One area in which there is a need for a greater input from local people in issues which affect them &mdash; and I ask the Minister to bear it in mind &mdash; is the role of the local community associations in major projects affecting their area.  For example, when an environmental impact study is done on a major project affecting an area, the local community have maybe just one month to respond to sometimes very technical and detailed issues.  Often the time was up before the community can get their technical and legal advisers together tp put forward their views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not want to go into specifics but the most recent was the Blackpool flyover in Cork.  The environmental impact study was published and the local people were given one month to make a submission.  They looked for an extension but did not get it.  We have a duty to ensure that people have the right to make a detailed informed submission on something which will affect their everyday life.  There is a defect in the system and, for that reason, I support the amendment.  I agree with Deputy Jim Mitchell that it needs to be flushed out on Report Stage but I agree with the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I also agree with Deputy Howlin's sentiments.  Perhaps his amendment could have been a little more carefully worded because I could see a difficulty arising in a local authority which covers a very wide ranging geographical spread.  However, the principle of trying to get the local community involved in what is happening at local authority level is a very good one.  Arising from any <Col N="950" /> changes which we bring about in local authority legislation, I hope that rather than taking away from the local community their monitoring and involved role we would increase it.  I raise such issues as the persistent need &mdash; certainly in relation to the local authority of which I am a member &mdash; to keep raising the price of the weekly planning list.  That is one way in which local communities can be involved in what is going on in their areas; first they were given out free to all the registerd residents' associations, they then cost £30 and now cost £50.  The same applies to the continuous raising of charges for local communities to make an appeal to get information on planning files.  I understand that if you ask for a copy of literature from a planning file you are sometimes asked for as much as £25 for a letter.  That kind of system is building up by stealth, it is just creeping in and eroding communities.  We all know of residents' associations, etc., who cannot get planning lists because they cannot afford the charges.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 states &ldquo;represents the interests of the local community&rdquo;.  I do not know whether Deputy Howlin has in mind something on the lines of the Swiss canton system where if a local authority decide to utilise an area as a graveyard and want to know if the local people agree, they carry out a referendum.  I am not thinking of going that far, that individual matters like that should be the subject of a referendum, but I should like to see some further extension of the system which exists in our council.  We have a system called &ldquo;deputation&rdquo; where, once a month, community groups can write to the council and ask to be received in deputation.  They may submit five items on the agenda, the relevant officials sit in on the council and the councillors from the area can be present.  We have a kind of three-way discussion on problems relating to local areas.  There is the germ of a very good policy and system there which I should like to see being used more effectively throughout the country to allow communities to feel they are a part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Deputy Howlin's amendment I <Col N="951" /> should also like to see a system whereby these community groups could be properly registered with their local authority and properly elected from their own communities. There is a case to be made for better accountability by some of the community groups.  Very often residents' associations are elected at meetings where there might be only ten or 15 residents represented and perhaps those committees do not properly represent the views of the people.  If we assisted community groups to be properly structured, then they would be allowed to have a real and relevant input to policy decisions.  In some instances the councillors could have a real input in their organisations because very often you run foul of one group who say that another group do not properly represent their community and there is a fight between them.  Local authorities should help in setting up structures so that these groups can be properly registered.</P>
    <P>As I said, I agree with the sentiments of the amendment but I am not sure it fully gets to grips with bringing together local involved communities.  The whole Bill needs to be changed to do that.</P>

      <P>When I spoke on the Bill last week I dealt with its pros and cons. I agree with it but there are limits beyond which we should be careful not to go.  I <Col N="952" /> have no hesitation in saying that it is essential we try to achieve the highest possible standards in public office and maintain them.  Reference is made in the explanatory memorandum to the various interests that a Member might register such as the ownership of land, company directorships and so on but I note in Part II that details of savings or investment accounts should be registered with the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad.  I should like to sound a warning that one can go too far down that road and dissuade people, who may have a worthwhile contribution to make to public life, from serving the public as a matter of principle.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a number of provisions which would protect the interests of the Members of the Houses of the Oireachas in the event of allegations being made.  That is what the Bill should do and I agree with that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to compliment the Labour Party, and Deputy Howlin in particular, for bringing forward this worthwhile and timely Bill. Internationally, we are very much out of step in that we do not have a code of conduct or a yardstick with which to measure the performance of those who hold public office.  In debating the Bill we should be mindful of the great deal of apathy and cynicism towards politicians and the political process.  A Bill which sets standards for public representatives by which the public can gauge their performance, is necessary in that it would go a long way towards restoring the confidence of the public in the political process and integrity to political life.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, democracy is a delicate flower which needs constant nurturing and attention lest it be replaced by something far less palatable.  Our democracy is being undermined by the cynicism and apathy towards the political process and politicians.  Those involved in the political process are acutely aware of this malaise. I make no bones about the fact that I have firmly held opinions on who is responsible for that attitude.  The politics of promises and the politics of broken promises subsequently, has a lot to answer for but a</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> Bill such as this would go a long way towards, addressing the problem.  What is unfortunate is that the public no longer distinguish between those of us who behave ourselves and act in a manner which benefits the office we hold and those who do not.  It is a plague on all our houses and it needs to be tackled immediately if we are to protect the democratic process itself.  Not only is the Bill necessary to protect the interests of those who participate in the democratic process at election time but it is also necessary to protect the interests of politicians.</P>
    <P>I can say in all honesty that the vast majority of those who hold public office, be they county councillors, urban councillors or Members of the Dáil or Seanad, are well motivated, well intentioned, honest and hard working but we have reached a point where the actions of a few have had a demoralising effect on the public who no longer distinguish between those of us who set standards for ourselves and those who do not.  The democratic process has not seen fit to date to lay down a yardstick by which the public can adjudicate on our performance.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Labour Party on bringing forward this timely Bill which should, if enacted, go a long way towards restoring confidence in the political process. However, I disagree with a number of sections.  I have no objection to Part I of the Bill which deals with gifts made to office holders valued in excess of £200. There is a danger that gifts will be given to office holders in the expectation that the favour will be returned at a later stage.  In an effort to allay people's fears, there is a duty on us to remove that possible stigma.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the Taoiseach when he was given the dagger inlaid with jewels was expected to return the favour and if he was I am sure he would not have done so.  The important point is that in passing this legislation we will be removing the possibility that a person who wishes to make a donation to individual politicians will have a legitimate expectation of receiving favours in return.  While the figure of £200 is somewhat arbitrary we <Col N="954" /> could tease out the worthy principle on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have no objection in principle to Part II of the Bill which deals with the registration of the interests of Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. However, I can see no reason why the spouse or children of a Member of this House should have to declare their interests.  That would amount to an invasion of the privacy of individuals who have no direct connection with this House.  I do not see any reason why those interests should be published.  If we had an ethics commission, consisting of a High Court judge, the Ombudsman and the Comptroller and Auditor General, they could in a suspected case of conflict of interest adjudicate.  I see no reason why the public at large should have access to private information on any Member of the House except in a suspected case of conflict of interest.  I certainly see no need to invade the private life of a spouse or of a child of an elected representative.</P>
    <P>I know that time is against me but I would like to deal with Part III of the Bill which deals with the funding of political parties, and the register of income and expenditure.  I feel extremely strongly about this.  In the absence of standards set down by this House, there is a grave danger that the political system is wide open to abuse by virtue of donations to political parties which could be given in the reasonable expectation of favourable consideration in decision making by Government Ministers.  That avenue has to be closed off in the very immediate future.</P>
    <P>We need State investment in the democratic process.  We need State funding for political parties.  The present system is wide open to abuse by unscrupulous people.  In the past week we have had evidence of business people attempting to influence decisions which are solely vested in the Taoiseach.  The crass arrogance of people who would assume unto themselves the capacity to influence decisions of that nature is hardly worthy of comment but it is a serious undermining of the democratic process.</P>
    <P>Hand in hand with State funding for <Col N="955" /> political parties we need legislation to limit the amount of money that parties or individual candidates can spend at election time.  The moneys available to political parties or candidates at election time go a long way to diluting the strength of individual votes in the sense that the more money a candidate has to launch an effective campaign the more he can undermine the impact of his competitors to compete for the votes of the electorate in any constituency.  In that sense there is a serious need for the elimination of that avenue of abuse.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there are numerous people involved in political parties whose abilities and energies are being absorbed by fund raising and, therefore, their capacity to put their ideas and energies into the political process is limited by the need to raise funds to compete in the present environment.  The amount of money spent by both parties and candidates at election time is immoral and there is a need for legislation to tackle this as well, although this is not raised in any great detail in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I support the principle of the Bill and we could tease it out further on Committee Stage if it were to get to that Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated last week, the Government will not be supporting this Bill in principle because we are not satisfied that it addresses the issues contained in it in an appropriate manner.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, the Bill is in three Parts.  First, it proposes to lay down rules for the acceptance of gifts by members of the Government, the Attorney General and Ministers of State; secondly, it provides for the registration of the financial and other interests of Members of the Dáil and Seanad; and finally, it proposes the publication of the income and expenditure of political parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may, I would like to deal first with the proposal to compel Deputies and Senators to declare their financial and other interests.  There is a strong argument which suggests that it would be <Col N="956" /> more appropriate to deal with this issue as a matter of House rules and procedure, rather than by way of legislation.  The exclusive right of each House of the Oireachtas to determine its own rules and procedures, and to regulate for its Members, is enshrined in Article 15.10 of the Constitution.  While some matters pertaining to Members &mdash; such as Members' allowances and expenses &mdash; are regulated by statute, these are matters for which legislation is explicitly prescribed elsewhere in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that questions concerning Members' private financial interests fall within the ambit of Article 15.10 &mdash; in which case it would be preferable to introduce a scheme for the registration of those interests by way of amending the Standing Orders or House rules rather than legislating.</P>
    <P>This view is reinforced by the fact that the Bill provides a mechanism for suspending a Member from the service of the House for not disclosing fully his interests.  Article 15.10 provides that each House shall make its own rules and Standing Orders, with power to attach penalties for their infringement.  Surely, the suspension of a Member would fall into this category.</P>
    <P>Another unsatisfactory aspect of proceeding by way of legislation is that this House is being asked to approve a Bill which will have implications not only for its own Members but also for Members of the other House.  The process will, of course, be repeated, in reverse, should the Bill go before the Seanad.  Again, this could be construed as being contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of Article 15.10.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges have already been asked to look at the question of establishing a register of interests, although no recommendations have been made.  That committee referred the matter to the parliamentary parties for discussion in the first instance, for the reason that it would be better to proceed with this proposal on the basis of all-party agreement.  I still feel that the best way to make progress might be through the <Col N="957" /> Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The Government propose to request that committee to undertake a detailed examination of all the issues involved and to bring forward proposals, which the parties could then consider.</P>
    <P>Although Deputy Gay Mitchell indicated that his party will be supporting the Bill in principle, he too has suggested that the issue might best be addressed through the rules and regulations of the House.  He has already proposed that, as a first step, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might be asked to prepare draft regulations.  This would, of course, be in line with the Government's thinking in the matter.  The fact that Deputy Mitchell also suggested a different format for ascertaining Members' interests involving the establishment of a parliamentary ethics commission, to whom disclosures would in the normal course be made on a confidential basis, indicates to me that there is more than one way to approach this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin, in opening this debate, has already indicated that his party would welcome proposals and ideas from the other parties which would establish the same principles as those being sought in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Prior to introducing their register of interests, the British House of Commons had a well established rule which required an MP who had a direct pecuniary interest in a matter before the House to declare it when taking part in the debate and to abstain from voting in connection with it.  In order to operate as a disqualification, the interest had to be immediate and personal and not merely of a general or remote character.</P>
    <P>Obviously, in our situation, it would not be possible to allow Deputies to abstain from voting on such grounds. However, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might wish to consider whether a simple requirement that a Member indicate his interest in any matter under discussion should be introduced. I am sure that such a requirement would be respected and adhered to by Members.  In this regard, it should be remembered that while even the present <Col N="958" /> British system cannot compel a Member to declare his interests, only one MP has refused to do so since the register was introduced 16 years ago and that was on grounds of principle.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree, therefore, that there are a number of alternatives which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could look at with a view to recommending the one which would best suit the particular needs of this House and its Members.</P>
    <P>While there has been some criticism of the fact that the Dáil does not have a register of Members' interests, I would like to point out &mdash; and this is sometimes overlooked &mdash; that Ministers and Ministers of State already subscribe to a code of practice, the underlying principle of which is that he or she should not engage in any activities whatsoever that could reasonably be regarded as interfering with, or being incompatible with, the full and proper discharge of his or her office. Ministers or Minister of State are not permitted to hold company directorships carrying remuneration.  Even if remuneration is not paid, it would be regarded as undesirable that a Minister or Minister of State should hold a directorship.  A resigning director can, however, enter into an agreement with a company under which the company would agree to his reappointment as director on the termination of public office.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Ministers or Ministers of State are not permitted to carry on a professional practice while holding office, although there would be no objection to making arrangements for the maintenance of a practice while holding public office and for return to the practice on ceasing to hold office.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that these principles, which all Ministers and Minister of State are made aware of on appointment, go considerably further than what is being proposed in the Bill before us.  I am not suggesting that back-bench TDs and Senators should also be compelled to adhere to this code of practice. I merely point it out as it is often overlooked by those who criticise our existing practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> The Bill also proposes that political parties be obliged to register for publication their income and expenditure, including the identity of donors, of over £1,000 in any one year.  The Clerk of the Dáil would be the registrar and twice a year would lay the details reported by the parties before the House.  In effect, this would mean publication.  Deputy Creed has already given his views in regard to the publication of the names of such parties.</P>
    <P>The financial resources of political parties is a sensitive issue, which has regularly stimulated discussion not only in this country but in various other parliamentary democracies.  In Ireland, there have always been very strict guidelines for political parties, particularly those in Government, to ensure that any information about donations is distanced entirely from the main thrust of the political machine.  In Government, Ministers will not ordinarily be aware of details about business contributions, nor do they have any wish to know them in the context of the decision-making process. While it is true that political parties in Ireland enjoy greater freedom from official control regarding their finances than most of their European counterparts, it is generally accepted that this position has not been abused.  I think that Deputy Howlin as much as acknowledged this fact when he indicated that the Bill is not so much designed to stop any existing corrupt practices but to ensure that the parties are above suspicion in this regard.</P>
    <P>As other contributors to this debate have already pointed out, it is somewhat disappointing that the Bill confines itself solely to the question of the public disclosure of political contributions and ignores the broader issue of the funding of political parties generally.  If we are to examine the question of party funding, we should perhaps examine the issue from all its different perspectives and then legislate accordingly, if that is considered necessary.  As my colleague the Minister for Finance said in the House last week, there is not much point in <Col N="960" /> legislating on one single aspect when there may be a case for taking a broader look at this whole issue.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have raised specifically the question as to whether the political parties should be funded mainly by the State or whether they should continue to rely on private subscriptions and national collections.  If the parties were to be State-funded exclusively, it would, of course, effectively remove any suspicions of political favouritism and would also negate the need for the type of register proposed in this Bill.  On the other hand, any move in this direction might most likely be met with a great deal of scepticism from the general public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who might have other priorities in relation to the spending of Exchequer funds.  I do not intend in this debate to go into the arguments for and against State funding of the political parties because, as I have said, the Bill does not deal with this broader issue but confines itself solely to the question of the public disclosure of funds received.  I repeat, nevertheless, that this is an omission from the Bill.</P>
      <P>To deal with the specific proposals in the Bill, I feel that there must be some doubt as to the enduring benefit of the availability of the type of information proposed.  The question of donations to political parties is frequently used as an emotive issue in party political discussions. If this Bill is passed, it could, in the future, lead to divisive and unhelpful debate over the Government's motives in relation to certain policies and decisions. This, in the long term, would not serve the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, details of contributions made to the political parties are kept quite distinct from the decision-making process and have no relevance whatsoever in relation to it.  However, if these details were to be made public, as proposed in the Bill, it could, perversely, become a factor in the process.  Almost every decision or policy position adopted <Col N="961" /> by the Government would most likely be viewed against the backdrop of whether a party contributor would stand to benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Ministers who at present can reach decisions based solely on the merits of a particular case might find themselves having to take into account also whether their decisions will leave them open to unfounded and unfair allegations of political favouritism.  Public reaction to even the most cogent arguments are bound to be coloured to some degree by this factor.</P>
    <P>It should also be remembered that while the wording of the Bill tends to give the impression that it is only the political parties who are being made accountable, the proposed legislation would have implications for the individuals and companies who make contributions.  Inevitably, it would lead to embarrassing comparisons between various donations received.  The purpose of the proposed legislation to allay public fears that contributions to political parties lead to unethical behaviour.  While it is reasonable that the parties should be accountable for their behaviour, I do not believe that it is fair to legislate for private individuals on this issue.</P>
    <P>The third proposal in the Bill deals with gifts made to certain office holders. Any gift worth more than £200 given to a member of the Government, the Attorney General or a Minister of State, by reason of his or her office, would become the property of the State.  The Bill proposes mechanisms for reporting the receipt of gifts; for determining their value and whether they were made in a private or official capacity; and for the purchase by office holders of gifts received by paying the amount in excess of £200.</P>
    <P>The procedure envisaged in the Bill is very unwieldy and bureaucratic and would be difficult to implement in practice. In particular, the clause defining the difference between a gift made to an office holder by virtue of his or her office and a gift made in a personal capacity or for purely personal reasons could lead to unseemly argument and dispute.  This <Col N="962" /> would be embarrassing not only for Ministers but for the person who presented the gift under dispute.</P>
    <P>I also think that there may be a case for treating gifts presented during State visits differently from those presented on domestic occasions.  I propose to give my reasons for this in a moment.</P>
    <P>In relation to gifts presented on domestic occasions, while there are no formal guidelines on the subject, the longstanding practice, adhered to by successive Governments, has been for Ministers and Ministers of State to accept relatively inexpensive gifts to mark occasions such as offical openings, etc. As I said, this is the same practice which has applied and been followed by successive Administrations over many years and it appears to have worked well up to now.  I believe that in 1983 the then Government examined the practice relating to gifts and decided that it did not need to be changed.  This is somewhat at variance with what is now being espoused by former members of that Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance rightly pointed out in his contribution to the debate last week that the vast majority of gifts received by Ministers at offical openings, etc., are relatively inexpensive. In addition, a considerable number of them would be personally engraved and, therefore, would be of no intrinsic value to anyone other than the recipient.  When a gift is presented to a Minister at an official opening, it is generally accepted that it is made as a small token of thanks to him or her personally for taking the time and trouble to perform the opening.  Those who make the presentation merely wish to follow the established protocol in this regard and certainly would have no wish to become embroiled in political controversy.</P>
    <P>I believe also that the setting of an upper limit on the value of gifts could be a potential source of embarrassment to those who wish to make this type of presentation to a Minister.  It could be argued that the setting of such a limit &mdash; £200 is the figure quoted in the Bill &mdash; might lead to the setting of a standard to which these people might feel obliged to conform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> Certainly Ministers do not expect to receive gifts of anything like the value of £200 when they agree to perform an official opening or whatever.</P>
    <P>As I said already, the situation is somewhat different in relation to gifts exchanged during State visits.  These visits are carried out in the context of internationally accepted practices and, in this regard, different countries have different standards in relation to the giving and receiving of gifts.</P>
    <P>When Ireland is the host, it behoves us to avoid prurience, to respect the customs and privacy of our guests and to reciprocate as appropriate.  I am satisfied that our existing practice in this matter is in keeping with long standing international practice.</P>
    <P>On a general point, there is a tendency to constantly compare our procedures and practices with those in other countries. This can sometimes be misleading. For example, in the United States, where the system of lobbying has been developed almost to the status of an industry, it is quite valid to expect public representatives to be accountable for any income received from such sources.  In Ireland, however, because of the tradition of following the party whip in all votes, the same necessity for public representatives to declare their sources of income simply does not arise.  Deputies almost always vote in accordance with party policy and only defy the Whip on matters of principle or personal conscience, where financial considerations are not involved.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Government will not support this Bill.  The procedures in relation to the receipt of gifts by office holders, as proposed in the Bill, are impractical and, most likely, unworkable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the disclosure of financial and other interests of Members, the Government feel that this matter should be pursued through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who could be asked to bring forward suitable recommendations for consideration by all parties in the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> Finally, we feel that the question of the finances of the political parties might best be looked at in its broader context rather than in the narrow manner proposed in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance in his speech last week sought to avoid the main issues we were putting forward and to introduce a number of red herrings.  The Minister made the point a number of times that the issues which are being raised could be appropriately dealt with by the rules of this House rather than through changes in legislation.  Our Bill raises three fundamental issues.  The first deals with valuable gifts made to public office holders.  The second deals with financial interests of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and the third with the funding of political parties.</P>
      <P>The first two issues could be dealt with through the rules of this House.  We attempted to deal with the issues of Members' financial interests through changes in Standing Orders.  About two years ago we submitted a detailed set of amendments to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  If they had been accepted we would have created a non-statutory register similar to the one outlined in this Bill.  The only decision made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was to refer our proposed amendments to the other parties, especially Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, for consideration and consultation.  Two years later I am reliably informed that neither parliamentary party has ever considered or discussed those amendments.  The net effect of referring the proposals to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael was to enable the large parties to sit on them.  It was only because it was apparent to us that the larger parties were never going to allow these issues to be debated seriously, that we drew up our Bill in the first place.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might say it is rubbish but it is a fact.  In view of what the Minister of State Deputy Brady said tonight and what the Minister for Finance said, on behalf of the Labour Party I have been authorised to make a proposal this evening.  We are prepared to withdraw our Private Members' Bill and not push it to a vote if there is general agreement in the House to the following proposition: that the issue of gifts to senior office holders together with the issue of Members' financial interests be referred for consideration to a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges; that that subcommittee shall be representative of every party in the House; that it shall meet in public session like any other <i>ad hoc</i> or informal subcommittee of the House and that the Minister for Finance agree to commence immediately discussions with representatives of other political parties on the issues of funding of political parties with a view to drawing up guidelines which ultimately would be included in legislative form.  That is a fair set of conditions which Deputy Brady should have no difficulty in accepting, judging by his contribution tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not in our Bill or in any of our contributions to this debate refer to the desirability of State funding as a panacea in relation to funding political parties. The matter of State funding was raised by the Minister for Finance.  He might have intended it as a serious item for discussion, or he might have intended it as a red herring to divert attention from the substantial issues in the Labour Party Bill.  However, the Labour Party feel that State funding of political parties would be desirable in the context of enhancing our concept of parliamentary democracy, but State funding in this sense does not mean a State handout.  If we are only to debate this issue in the context of how much more we can squeeze from the Department of Finance, this debate is a waste of time.  There is no support in the community, nor should there be, for <Col N="966" /> giving public money to anybody who does not have to account for the wise use of that money.  Therefore, the issue of State funding and any discussions that take place on that issue must include on the agenda the issue of disclosure of private sector contributions and the issue of limiting expenditure by political parties for political purposes.  State funding cannot and should not be used by political parties to top up money raised privately.  Neither should political parties forever be allowed to spend whatever they like to buy votes, on flashy gimmicks and on public relations stunts.  During the last election in Cork North Central we saw the buying of votes, bordering on the obscene.  Fortunately for many of us it did not succeed.  We want to see political parties being encouraged to compete on the basis of well researched policies and initiatives where they have the resources to communicate those ideas effectively to the public and where they operate on a level playing pitch where resources are concerned.  It is in that context that we see the discussion on State funding taking place.  Most countries in the European Community allow state funding. Belgium, Germany, Spain, France and other countries in Europe provide substantial state funding coupled with strict requirements on disclosure and strict limits on electoral spending.</P>
    <P>In relation to this Bill the house should note that it is aimed not only at ensuring ethics in our public life but at convincing the general public that politics is informed by those ethics.  We did not introduce this Bill in a holier than thou spirit.  We do not believe we have a monopoly on integrity in this House.  In my experience, short as it is, I have found that the vast majority of Members of the House can count integrity among their better qualities.  I have to admit that this is not the way this House is seen by the public at large.  If we are to be honest with ourselves we have to face the fact that the people we represent have become cynical and disenchanted with politics and with politicians.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread view in Ireland <Col N="967" /> today that Deputies are here primarily to feather their own nests and to look after their friends.  As I said, that is not a view that my experience would confirm. However, I have to accept that the perception of politics is very often every bit as important as the reality.  I believe that the vast majority of the Members of this House are people of high integrity.  I do not believe that they have anything to hide.  In fact, I would argue strongly that is in the interests of every Member of the House that financial interests and gifts received should be matters of public record.  To put it at its mildest, it is bound to puzzle a great many people that when we have nothing to hide we should spend so much time and effort in trying to hide it.</P>
    <P>There have also been several incidents and events in the past year or so that have contributed in no small measure to the cynicism I mentioned.  Some of those instances are small and some are rather fundamental.  I shall take one example. Within the past week I have read newspaper reports about an incident in which a journalist was escorted from a Fianna Fáil fundraising dinner, the excuse given being that the people attending would not like to be identified as Fianna Fáil supporters.  Stories such as that give substance to the common perception that there are well-heeled people in back rooms who consider their contributions to political parties as being investments from which a return is expected in due course.</P>
    <P>To take another small, or not so small, example, referred to already by Deputy Creed, there has been a great deal of publicity in recent days about the fund established to promote the ministerial ambitions and career of one of my Cork colleagues, Deputy Dennehy.  If Deputy Dennehy were appointed a Minister tomorrow morning I should be the first to congratulate him.  I want to have a Minister from Cork during the lifetime of this Government.  It is a scandal that the second city of the Republic is without representation at the Cabinet table.  But if a Deputy from Cork is appointed to the <Col N="968" /> Cabinet, I want to be absolutely satisfied that his first loyalty will be to his seal of office and to whatever brief he is given, and that in respect of his dealings with the people of Cork his loyalty will be to all and not to one segment of those people.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is some shadowy group of businessmen waiting and hoping to call in IOUs from a person they would consider to be &ldquo;their&rdquo; Minister. I know from all of my dealings with Deputy Dennehy that he is an honourable, hard-working, and efficient Deputy.  That is why I am amazed that he could think it is in his interests for anyone to have the perception that he would be beholden for financial favours to secure his own advancement.</P>
    <P>There have been much more serious incidents of a kind likely to add to the cynicism about politics.  I do not intend to refer in detail to the Goodman affair since that is likely to be debated in the House tomorrow.  But, lest anyone is in any doubt about it, I assure the House that there is a widespread view in the community that Mr. Goodman owes a large portion of his very substantial wealth to his political connections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly bow to your direction.  Apart from that affair, in the past couple of years there has been the fiasco about broadcasting, in which there was all the appearance that RTE were being squeezed at the behest of <Col N="969" /> private commercial interests &mdash; private interests that were not particularly successful in their own field of commercial radio.  There are still major unanswered questions about the motivation for the legislation that was pushed through the Dáil at that time.</P>
      <P>Then there was the case of another builder, whizz kid, and banker, who was jailed in Northern Ireland for wrongdoing connected with the collapse of his business.  Despite the fact that the implications and ramifications of the collapse of that business were much more considerable in the Republic of Ireland, the same man faced no charge here, giving rise to questions that have never been answered.</P>
      <P>For months, if not years, a cloud has been hanging over the whole planning process in Ireland as a result of allegations, innuendoes, and rumour, of corruption, bribery, and political connections.  That cloud of suspicion has been made worse, of course, by the cavalier attitude of many councillors, especially Fianna Fáil councillors, about the need to preserve green spaces and amenity areas in our cities and towns. In Dublin alone, for example, rezoning proposals large enough to build a city the size of Limerick have been rammed through council meetings with the minimum of public debate and discussion.</P>
      <P>Within the very recent past there have been arguments in the House about the background of the Government decision to publish Carysfort College without any independent valuation having been carried out on the property.  What we know for certain in that that was a very hasty decision that presented a large property to UCD as a gift &mdash; even though UCD did not particularly want it &mdash; and, at the same time, gave another very large present to a wellknown Fianna Fáil supporter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of those issues put together add up to the background against which the Bill is being discussed.  We would be deluding ourselves if we were to believe that our standing as politicians in the community is so high that we do not need the kind <Col N="970" /> of code of conduct that would remove any taint of suspicion from our activities.</P>
    <P>It is because I believe in the integrity of our political system that I urge the Government to accept the proposal being put forward this evening.  In the event that the Government decide not to accept even the prospect of self regulation of our affairs, the Bill will be put to a vote. If the Government majority votes against the Bill, it is the political system and all of the people who believe in it that will lose in the end.</P>
    <P>Contributions made by Deputies in the debate would indicate that some have not even read the Bill or its explanatory memorandum.  It would appear that even though there is a very limited time available to discuss Private Members' Bills or motions, there is a programme from Government benches to just reject them straight away.  Deputies have said that the Bill refers only to Government Members. That claim is ridiculous.  The Bill refers to all elected Members in the House.  Not only those in the Chamber tonight, let me add.</P>
    <P>In conclusion a great deal of work has gone into the Bill.  It is frustrating that the Bill is before the House tonight, in that no progress has been made.  Again I put forward the offer I made to the Government Members at the outset of my speech: if a subcommittee is formed from the Committee of Procedure and Privileges to discuss the proposals I have laid before Members this Bill will be withdrawn and no vote need take place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The wellknown scandal of coal distributors donating large sums of money to the major parties was a matter of great public disquiet in the Dublin area.  When there was a serious smog problem in the city the major parties were receiving money from the main sellers of smog causing coal, and successive Governments were dragging their feet on the issue.  The funding of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="971" /> party by the Goodman Group is a matter we may hear more about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  This is something that we may hear more of in the next few days.  He who pays the piper calls the tune.  The coal distributors and the Goodman Group incidents are just two examples of a rot which we suspect goes deep into the core of the Irish political system.  The fact that the major parties are unwilling to disclose the source of their financial power suggests that they have something to hide.  The makers of various industrial poisons and dangerous chemicals and the operators of highly polluting industries have been involved in political corruption and scandals in countless incidences around the globe. This begs the question whether the same scandals are yet to be discovered here.</P>
      <P>In many incidences we are mystified by planning decisions taken in this country, especially by means of section 4 motions, as they are clearly not in the public interest or in the interest of good planning. We can only wonder what is behind them.  We wonder to what extent the party who are renowned for their support of the building industry are supported by the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is amazing that there is no register of the interests of members of the Oireachtas.  Members of local authorities have to register their financial interests and I see no reason a different rule should apply to national legislators.  Most parliaments throughout the world have this stipulation and it is an extremely important one.  Most of the political parties in the State represent financially powerful interest groups whether big business or organised labour and, accordingly, have a source of ready funding.  The Greens are here to represent the interests of the planet but do not unfortunately provide us with money other than donations from members and sympathisers.  The interests which are destroying the planet are those <Col N="973" /> which are funding the major political parties, thereby ensuring their vested interests are looked after.</P>
    <P>Regarding election funding we feel that in order to ensure that elections are decided by persuasion and political thought rather than saturation advertising, there should be a limit on the amount of money an election candidate can spend in trying to be elected.  It is more and more my impression that money has at least as much influence as votes.</P>
    <P>The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, in the last general election and in the European elections, spent less than £10,000 but got £80,000 votes.  That works out at 12p per vote.  It would be reasonable if political parties were to receive this level of funding from public finance. There is, however, one aspect of this which gives me cause for concern, and that is section 20 (1) which provides that every registered political party shall report to the register the name of its leader and the address of the party headquarters. This is a particular problem for us because we have no leader and we have no headquarters.  There are no leaders in the Green Party and it continually amazes me that the other parties think that the centralised and authoritatorian way in which they operate and in which they govern when in power are the only possible forms of organisation.</P>
    <P>To conclude, this Bill is somewhat limited in scope.  There is nothing of substance in it with which anyone could find fault.  It is, therefore, a shame that the Government parties are opposing it and one has to ask why.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan says it is pointless coming in here with motions or legislation during Private Members' time because everything is rejected by the Government speakers.  I would reject <Col N="974" /> that view.  It is obvious from the Minister's contribution tonight that progress will be made as a result of this debate.  I would also point out that there was a debate here not so long ago, in which I participated on a Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Gay Mitchell in regard to equal rights for women being provided for in the Constitution.  That was an excellent debate and I believe that the Women's Rights Committee of which I am a member will take up some of the recommendations.  Debating such Bills in Private Members' time can be very productive.</P>
      <P>I want to comment on some aspects of the Bill.  Deputy Creed referred to the cynicisms of politicians.  I agree with him, and it is something I find hard to deal with because it is everywhere.  This cynicism is caused by many things.  We ourselves are part of the problem.  We do not help our cause by the manner in which we sometimes behave here.  At the same time I believe the introduction of this Bill will lead to progress.</P>
      <P>Part I of the Bill refers to the gifts to holders of certain public offices, gifts to members of Government, to the Attorney General and to Ministers of State.  This section would be unworkable. The provision relates to gifts exceeding a value of £200.  I feel that what is behind this section is the question of expensive gifts given in the past, but the Minister for Finance outlined clearly that on many occasions inexpensive gifts are given, especially at EC level where Ministers build up good personal relationships with their counterparts.  This is where problems would be created when Ministers would have to report back to the Secretary of the Government gifts valued in excess of £200.  It would be quite complicated if we had Ministers coming back from Europe queuing up to pay duty on anything valued in excess of £200.  I know Deputy Howlin is a generous man, but I think this is a little meanminded.  There are traditions in certain countries of giving gifts.  I feel that this section is not the way to approach this matter.  Perhaps it could be dealt with at the Committee of Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> The other aspects of the Bill warrant more attention than the previous section. That brings us to Part II of the Bill.  The question then is whether legislation is required.  I heard the contributions of Deputy Gay Mitchell and others who seem to think that it would be possible to do this within the Houses of the Oireachtas because there is a non-statutory scheme covering the same ground in relation to members' interests in Westminster.  There is a similar situation in the United States and the House of Commons has power to take action in relation to any member who does not register or who furnishes false or misleading information.  This House should follow that example.  Under our Constitution it would be more appropriate that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges deal with this issue.  Local authority members have to declare an interest.  I was interested in a remark the Minister of State made tonight that a Minister, Deputy or Member might declare his interests in a particular matter under discussion.  That applies in local authorities.  That is a very pragmatic, appropriate manner of dealing with this issue.  We find ourselves in a dilemma. Do we legislate for something we can deal with within our own rules and regulations in this House and in the Seanad? We should use the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to deal with this model.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the past this issue was referred to the parliamentary parties I suppose Deputy Garland would have a problem referring it to his parliamentary party &mdash; but I feel we should do that and take action.  The Minister has responded positively tonight to the debate on this aspect and Opposition Members should accept that.</P>
    <P>Political parties registering income and expenditure has been a matter of public concern.  My attitude on this would be in line with that of my colleagues on this side of the House who stated that we have missed an opportunity here of looking at financing political parties on an all party <Col N="976" /> basis.  State involvement in funding political parties in proportion to their size and strength happens in other countries and we should look at that aspect.  The most appropriate way would be partial funding from the State; there should always be the option for private funding.</P>
    <P>National collections have always been part and parcel of our traditional means of raising funds.  However, I accept the view expressed here tonight that a system that allows people with money to buy power is bad.  People have put that criticism to me, and I think it is legitimate. We should consider this matter on an all party basis.  I would not advocate total State funding, but partial state funding would help tackle this problem.  Every citizen has the right and should be given an opportunity to contest an election.</P>
    <P>This leads me to TDs' salaries.  This was referred to in the debate last week. The salary increases we give ourselves are continually criticised, and here we are our own worst enemies in that we do not stand up for and respect ourselves on these issues.  The public hear the same old story &mdash; that politicians are this and that, have a very comfortable existence, etc.  That is not the case.  Deputies last week gave very detailed accounts of expenses a politician has to face.  I am not complaining but when it comes to this type of debate it might be restated that if we want to respect democracy and give everybody an opportunity, we should consider the whole question of state funding. There is a role for the State in the political process in relation to the size and strength of the parties.  I do not wish to go on at great length about this.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a Bill of this nature will lead to some progress.  The Minister has given a positive response to one aspect of the Bill.  Deputy O'Sullivan and his party should see that progress has been made.  He introduced a proposal here tonight and we on this side of the House will consider it.  The Minister of State has responded positively, and I feel we can make progress particularly on Part II of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have been in this House <Col N="977" /> 26 years and I have seen many Members come and go.  Sometimes I think the &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; Members last the shortest time in the House.  It is a fact that every Deputy who ever proposed an increase in pay for Members of this House lost his seat at the next election. People are not fooled by hypocrisy.  I say that to underline what I consider was a grossly hypocritical cynical speech by Deputy Garland, which was to be expected.</P>
      <P>These anti-pollution people think nothing of polluting the air of this House with the lowest allegations against companies or people either against whom charges are not proved or who are not here to defend themselves.  There is no mistaking the intent of those remarks.  I will say no more on that, but the electorate have their own way of levelling that field and I have no doubt it will be levelled again.  I do not like to predict the political demise of any person because it can happen to oneself, but the public are very quick to see through hypocrisy.</P>
      <P>Labour and Fine Gael were in office for nine years between 1973 and 1987 and they did not think it necessary to introduce such a Bill.</P>

      <P>This again is an attempt to catch the imagination of the public because people might write a letter here and there objecting to something or other.  I think the people have been served very well by their politicians.  We are among the lowest paid politicians in any country.  In most countries politicians are not expected to pay the overheads of running their constituencies out of their incomes, as happens here.  It would be a good idea if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges got together and appointed a subcommittee of responsible people &mdash; not that anyone on that committee is not responsible &mdash; to consider what they see <Col N="978" /> is lacking.  If any Member has a vested interest, let such Member declare it.  As the Minister said, because we have very narrow margins under the PR system, a Government may have, as we have, a majority of one.  If one of our Members was excluded from voting it could become very difficult.  People have to declare their interest.  I am one of that rare species, a full time politician.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are probably becoming more numerous.</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Bill outlines registrable interests which are to be included in the statement provided to the Clerk. Certain prescribed details relating to the listed interests must also be included. Section 14 (1) (f) refers to liabilities exceeding £1,000 in value.  Does that mean I would have to disclose my overdraft which is far in excess of £1,000 to the Clerk of the Dáil?  Is there to be no privacy whatsoever for people in public life?  Are people to be deterred from coming into public life because once you become a Member of the Dáil you have no right to any privacy whatsoever? Would you have to declare your liabilities in the bank to the Clerk of the Dáil?  If they are to be kept in a secret list, as it were, what is the point of that?  They would soon become public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a politician is bent, he will be bent no matter what the system.  If politicians' are taking backhanders, it does not matter how much you pay them or what laws you have, they would still be involved in this practice.  A person is either honest or dishonest.  We should be very careful that we do not create a climate of cynicism.  Sometimes such a climate is generated in here rather than outside among the people.  There is a certain cynicism that when you go on visits abroad you are junketing.  Here, again, I have found among my own constituents that there is nothing like the begrudgery which the news media claims exists.  Most times when people are abroad in the interests of this country they are selling Ireland abroad and doing <Col N="979" /> a good job promoting our country of which we can be very proud.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the restrictions on public representatives and what they can do because of the uncertainty of tenure of membership of the Dáil and certainly the uncertainty of tenure of a Minister in office.  It is right that the Minister in office does not practise his profession, whether he is a lawyer or in the wholesale, retail or manufacturing business.  While he is a Minister he must be full-time and as the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy V. Brady, stated clearly there are already procedures in place to ensure that Ministers, on taking up office, do not remain directors of their own companies.  There is no doubt in my mind that there would be all-party agreement for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to take over this matter and come up with a solution that would satisfy those people who are worried.</P>
    <P>When elections come along they cost us all a lot of money.  I am very grateful to the people who give me contributions towards my election fund.  Because they happen to think I am a good public representative and the kind of person they would like to see continue in public life, I think it would be wrong that those people would be embarrassed in any way into making public that they decided to contribute to my election fund.  I owe a big &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to many people over the years who have contributed to my election campaign.  I am most grateful to them and I hope they will continue to contribute.  I do not see why any Bill should require them to make public what they give to me.</P>

      <P>The Bill states that a return of receipts and expenses must set out the name of each person who contributed in excess of £1,000.  I will accept a contribution from the Deputy at any time.  It is ridiculous that the names of those people should be published on a <Col N="980" /> list.  For example, I would like to know how The Workers' Party can afford to mount such huge campaigns, they are a party whose support ranges from 2 per cent to 4 per cent in the polls, yet they have more posters and more newspapers than anybody else.  It would be very interesting to hear from where they get their money; perhaps they have a magic printing press we do not know about.  It would be very interesting to compare that with the expenditure of the Labour Party which is a far bigger organisation &mdash; or the Fine Gael Party or the Fianna Fáil Party.  I never hear queries as to how The Workers' Party can mount such a huge campaign at election time with only between 2 per cent and 4 per cent of the public supporting them.  I note from what Deputy O'Sullivan said that it seems the Labour Party would be happy to withdraw the Bill and bring it to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>There are certain things with which we do agree.  One matter which would be interesting to discuss would be financing of political parties at election time by the State but that is something which the people might object to.  The taxpayer might say: &ldquo;No, I do not want to finance you&rdquo;.  That could lead to a bigger argument because in what proportion do you give funding to the parties of the House?  Is it to be based on the number of votes somebody got at a previous election?  There could be all sorts of complications in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not look for funding for political parties; that is the Minister's suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply saying there is a suggestion there and it has been picked up by one or two other people that this might be done.  The small parties would find the idea more attractive than a bigger party because of our broader support from the people.  To a certain extent it is something that might be <Col N="981" /> regarded as a boost to the smaller parties and that, in itself, might create a problem among the people.  At least, when people give you a contribution it is because they want to give it.  Frequently people who support other parties will give you a contribution on a personal basis because you represent a view with which they agree.</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom there is a system which has worked very well over the years where people declare their interests and where it is not compulsory. As the Minister stated in his speech, where these rules applied there was only one person over the years who refused to divulge his private interests.  It is left to the electorate, when the next election comes along, to decide whether they want that person.  I have always said that if every person in this country had to be elected to their job on the basis of the work performed by them every few years, they would work better and we would be regarded as another Switzerland.  It is on the basis of our performance our integrity and the trust the people place in us that we are here.  No one is quicker to see through a fake than the Irish electorate and they will find out sooner or later.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise this point and I will finish with it: the holier-than-thou merchants I have seen from time to time in this House have not survived too many elections because the people were quick to see through them.  This Bill is unnecessary and it tried to cast aspersions on Members of this House which are not deserved.  This House is capable of policing itself.  We have a Committee on Procedure and Privileges on which I have served in the past.  I am aware of the effectiveness of this committee.  We may argue with each other across the Floor of this House but when we are in committee together we are one team of people upholding what is in the best interests of the reputation and the integrity of this House and the image the public have of us.  All of us can say we regard that highly. I am glad I had an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  In the few minutes left somebody else may wish to contribute who would not otherwise have had the opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  It is important that we have standards laid down by which the political process can be gauged.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to discuss the lack of standards and the way politicians are judged.  We have the strongest judgment of all in the electorate, a judgment which in recent years has come all too frequently. There is no substitute for the interview board which politicians have to face every three and a half to four years in discerning the record of service they have given to their constituents and their country.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill to the House is very timely.  All of us know there is tremendous cynicism about the public esteem in which politicians are held, and that is regrettable.  An ethics commission as proposed by my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, under the guidance of the Houses of the Oireachtas would go some way towards adjudicating on matters where conflicts of interest arise.  It would be a channel by which these matters could be resolved outside the present system.  There is an impression abroad that politicians seek public office just to feather their own nests.  There is an impression that there is a wealthy group of people in a club called Leinster House. A great educational and information process is required in order to inform the public more fully about the workings of the Houses of the Oireachtas, how the parliamentary process operates and about the lives of serving Members of the Oireachtas.  From time to time I welcome visitors to this House, particularly school groups.  Even though they may look on these visits as a reason to put aside their studies, nevertheless it is an important feature of the parliamentary process that we continue to allow as many groups as possible, particularly young people, to visit the Houses of the Oireachtas where they can see for themselves the workings of the Oireachtas and are further informed as to what happens here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various speakers referred to the fact that Ministers cannot continue to be directors of companies after they take <Col N="983" /> office, that a conflict of interest would arise in these cases.  There have been several examples in recent years of the thin line between the holding of office of a particular Minister and the various business interests of that Minister outside the House.</P>

I will not give examples tonight &mdash; they are too numerous to mention &mdash; of how various Ministers, through no fault of their own in many cases, become embroiled in public controversy.  This arises as a result of a lack of rules and guidelines in this area.</P>

      <P>I think self-expulsion is the word that could be used.  The funding of political parties has been treated with suspicion not only by people outside the House but also by people inside it.  The Progressive Democrats talked very vehemently about involvement of politicians in businesses outside this House and said we should consider the matter of political funding from the Exchequer. I have been astounded in recent times to see in the media suggestions from an ex-Member of this House, who fares rather well from business interests outside of it, that bankrupt parties should not be looking for help from the State.  That <Col N="984" /> person accused Fine Gael of having bankrupt ideas.  I find this astonishing from an ex-Member of the House who knows that is far from the case.  Members of the legal profession, probably more so than any other profession, have learned to exploit the resources of this House and to be Members of the House on a part-time basis.  They facilitate their business interests elsewhere in the city of Dublin while this House is sitting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the ex-Member of the House to whom I referred has lost interest in the funding of political parties in recent times because two or three of his colleagues occupy ministerial posts at present.  Perhaps he finds it more convenient to gain funding from oil companies and industrialists rather than from the Exchequer.  I find it very strange that a person who has experience within the House, and seems to be running the country from outside it, misunderstands the proposal for Exchequer funding for political parties.  It disappoints me that a person with experience of the workings of the Oireachtas finds himself in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have great difficulty at election time in coming to terms with the spending of political parties on posters and so on.  Were it not for the contributions received not only by individual Deputies but by political parties it would not be possible for many people to stand for election.  Many of the contributions are far too small.  Without support from the Exchequer, which is practically nonexistent at the moment, there is no way <Col N="985" /> that democracy can function properly. Maybe there is some underground source that I am not aware of in a particular political party &mdash; certainly from the point of view of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Local Government Bill, 1991: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>In page 6, subsection (1), between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following definition:</P>
    <P>&ldquo; `local community' means all persons normally resident in the functional area of a local authority;&rdquo;. </P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting Deputy Howlin's amendment, I believe that communities should be the basic unit of local government.  This would require full scale legal recognition of the informal structures which have evolved over the past 20 years.  A generally accepted definition of &ldquo;community&rdquo; has to be formed which would take into account the identifiable character of an area, its geographic boundaries and the size of its population.</P>
      <P>The power of a community council should relate to the maintenance of standards in the community, whether in relation to litter, noise and traffic control or the general standards of well being. It should be the remit of a community council to make regulations regarding parking and traffic flow; it should be the responsibility of a community council to erect litter bins, road signs and road markings. The responsibility of overseeing recreation areas and children's playgrounds should be that of the community councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community councils should have a central role in working with municipal or <Col N="987" /> county councils in the drafting of local development plans.  This power should be extended by giving community councils the right to deny or approve certain types of planning applications.  In bringing the ideas of local democracy further, it should also be the responsibility of the community councils to elect area representatives to represent roads and other housing groups at community council level; the whole question of open public meetings should also be a priority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen talked about the value of receiving delegations by local authorities but, while this is very useful, it by no means goes far enough.  What is needed is local plebiscites or referenda at all levels of local government.  There is already provision for these on, for example, the question of a possible change in street names; plebiscites should be used on local planning issues and it seems a total negation of democracy for local authorities to ride roughshod over the local community in such an issue as Howth House.  Major industries should not be sited in areas if there is local opposition. Emotive situations can arise as was the case in the proposed Merrell Dow factory in east Cork where local opposition succeeded in stopping this crazy project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a crazy project in spite of what Deputy Sherlock thinks. Sooner or later people will be seriously injured &mdash; or killed &mdash; in these confrontations. Indeed, on the Castlebar ring road issue people were injured and the use of local referenda would avoid these frightening situations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> Recognition of these added responsibilities for community councils should be reflected in the employment in each area of people to undertake the clerical administrative responsibilities as well as general workers for the other work of the council. The principle should be that people are transferred from the present top heavy levels of central bureaucracy.  Redistribution of present local authority funding would mean that each community council would have their own budget.  In addition, community councils should also have the power to levy fines in areas such as litter, traffic and noise control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the general thrust of this amendment.  There should be more local community involvement in local authorities; indeed, I have promoted this idea for some time and, where possible, I try to encourage it within the existing framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several local development associations, chambers of commerce, rotary clubs and so on who would be willing to participate in some form of local authority administration.  There should be a forum for these people to express their views and ideas on what is right for their own community.  There are several individuals within communities who would be prepared to help the local authorities in various ways; for example, I have seen cases where local farmers have come together in co-operation with the council to remove fences, bends on roads and so on, which was a great saving. This type of work could be expanded and result in a great saving for local authorities; a lot more work could be done. In other areas clean-ups were organised between local community development associations and local authorities.  As this has been successful in the past there is no reason for not having an expansion of the role and co-operation between local authorities and community associations. For the revival and regeneration of local communities, it is important that people feel they have an important role to play; the dynamism of future regeneration of our countryside will come from local <Col N="989" /> communities but, unless they are confident that they have a role to play and feel they are being listened to their present enthusiasm will wane in time.</P>
    <P>At present there is great enthusiasm as people are prepared to help local authorities but, in time, they will become frustrated because of bureaucracy, because the local area engineer may not co-operate with them or because the local councillors may be afraid of them because of publicity.  The great movement sweeping through many communities at present and the energy and interest created within communities must be harnessed.  Unfortunately, unless the Minister acts it will not take place as a result of this Bill.  Unless we concentrate on small communities and get them together for the betterment of the overall community, rural Ireland is doomed.  I do not want to repeat myself but we must find structures where local development associations, local tourist organisations, chambers of commerce, rotary clubs and so on can have a say and influence local government policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>While co-operation between local communities and the statutory bodies is certainly desirable, there are some areas where that has already taken place.  That should be encouraged because it is much easier for the local authority to govern when they have the co-operation and support of the community. Great pains should be taken to ensure that the two are not at loggerheads or poles apart because, if that is the case, the community at large suffers.  In relation to the performance of statutory functions, only elected members of local authorities should be given that role. There would be no sense in having elected public representatives if other supplementary bodies are given more than an advisory role.</P>

    <P>With regard to the planning process, it would be undesirable to encourage or incorporate changes in the planning acts which would result in planning decisions being made by way of public acclamation for the simple reason that there would be vast variations in the decisions made.  For <Col N="990" /> example, a decision taken on a planning application in one community could be diametrically opposite to the decision taken on a similar application in another location.  There is a grave danger that the planning process could be brought into disrepute as a result.  It would not be a good idea to make such a change for the simple reason that when people are elected to public office, be it to this House, the other House or local authorities it is a matter for them to assess the will of the public and try to respond as best they can.  They should not become hostages of the public.  They should try to ensure that the various acts are applied and that everyone in their jurisdiction receives fair treatment under the law as administered by the local authorities.</P>

      <P>At the outset of this discussion we talked about the definition of &ldquo;local community&rdquo;.  We considered this matter at some length and thought about a definition along the lines suggested by Deputy Howlin in his amendment. However, after due consideration we thought on balance that it would not be wise to consider the matter any further and decided against accepting the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Howlin's definition limits the &ldquo;local community&rdquo; to those persons who would normally be resident in the functional area of the local authority.  We find this term in section 6 which deals with the general competence of local authorities. There is a problem with the term &ldquo;residents&rdquo;. An authority's actions should not be strictly confined to their residents.  The residents of the hinterland surrounding a town are every bit a part of the local community as are the town residents.  If <Col N="991" /> the town authority are to provide facilities for the local community they will and should be availed of by those who work in, travel in or pursue recreation in the town but they need not necessarily be residents of the town.  Therefore, the local community often cross county boundaries at boundary towns and one county should be able to take action to benefit what in normal terms is the local community, those living in the local area.</P>
    <P>I would like the term &ldquo;local community&rdquo; to take its everyday ordinary meaning, what people would understand that term to mean.  It would be unnecessary and, indeed, wrong to define the term in legislation.  Deputy Mitchell supports that view, perhaps not fully but he supports the principle I am trying to establish. For this reason I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment because it would be restrictive.  We should not include anything which would be restrictive if we are trying to help local communities. We can rely on the local authorities to deal in a common sense way with what would be regarded as the best interests of the local community be they the residents of the town or those who live in its environs or some distance away, in providing services.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 5, I do not think there is any need to include a definition of &ldquo;represents the interests of the local community&rdquo;.  Under section 5 that will be a function of the local authority and it will, as it is at the moment, be a matter for the democratically elected members of the authority acting as the council to determine the action to be taken to fulfil their representational role in the same way as it is a matter for the Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Other extraneous matters were raised by Deputies.  One of the Deputies who raised a local matter of interest to me has left the House so I will reserve my position.  I will deal with him and his remarks about Castlebar in a suitable way at a later time.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the Minister's comment that he did consider <Col N="992" /> including these definitions in the Bill.  It is important in the preliminary stages of this debate that we emphasise our priorities. I am strongly of the view that we should focus our attention on the role and the central importance of the local community in all matters relating to local government.  It is regrettable that the Minister has not come up with a form of words which could be inserted into the Bill but we have made the point as best we can and will have to monitor the way this section relates to the involvement of local people which is the objective of the Labour Party.  I will withdraw amendments Nos. 3 and 5.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 38, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to section 3&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert another definition of &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Prescribed&rdquo; under the terms of the Bill means prescribed by regulations made by the Minister and cognate words shall be construed accordingly.  My amendment seeks to insert after the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; the words &ldquo;subject to section 3&rdquo;.  Section 3 gives the Minister the power and authority to make regulations for the purposes of this Bill.  We will deal with that when we come to discuss the next batch of amendments.  What I am seeking to do is to delimit the power of the Minister to prescribe.  This relates to the section which purports to abolish the <i>ultra vires</i> rule.  Where the Minister proposes that powers be devolved he invariably adds a sting to the tail and keeps to himself the power to arbitrate what should and should not be done at local level.  The power to prescribe should be clipped and circumscribed by the will of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing that the definition of &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; be subject to the diktats of section 3 which is the subject of amendments. I want to restrict the power of the Minister to prescribe the functions of local authorities.  It is essential that this <Col N="993" /> be done otherwise the Bill, which seeks to do two things, encompass the principle of subsidiarity and do away with the old motion of <i>ultra vires,</i> will be seriously deficient.  The main thrust of the Bill which seeks to encompass the principle of subsidiarity and do away with the old notion of <i>ultra vires,</i> is seriously deficient if we do not adopt this amendment.  For that reason I urge the House to support the provisions of the amendment.  As I have said, we will be debating it in some detail in the next batch of amendments which are interrelated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with Deputy Howlin's amendment for the simple reason that apart from the cases the Deputy has mentioned, there are a number of other sections in the Bill which provide that certain things may be prescribed, but the Bill does not actually say who will do the precribing.  Going quickly through the Bill, one finds this question arising in relation to the amounts of money local authorities may spend under powers that are notionally given to them by this Bill.  We find that the Minister may prescribe certain things under section 30, and section 29 deals with the proposal and application for alteration of the local authority boundary. There are other cases in the Bill where, although certain things are required to be prescribed, the Bill does not say who will do the prescribing and something along the lines Deputy Howlin has proposed would give accuracy and clarity to the Bill.  We should not leave legislation in a state where there is any doubt as to where the power resides to make any or all of these prescriptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a standard definition of &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; and it has been used in many Acts over the years.  &ldquo;Prescribed&rdquo; simply means prescribed by regulations, and regulations can only be made as the Act provides.  Section 3 provides the power to make regulations and the reference in the definition of prescribed to regulations made by the Minister can only refer to regulations made under section 3.  The amendment is unnecessary and <Col N="994" /> would add nothing to the Bill.  All regulations are subject to the provisions of section 3.  I think that answers Deputy Dukes point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out several sections in the Bill where a number of things are allowed to be prescribed, for example, local authorities that are proposing boundary allocations are required to inform such other persons as may be prescribed.  There is no clear or obvious link between that and section 3.  Section 3 has to do with the way in which the Minister goes about making orders or regulations under the Bill.  There is no obvious link to me between the requirement &mdash; and this is only one case in the Bill &mdash; that is being imposed on a local authority that is proposing a boundary alteration to inform other interested parties or other persons.  The section refers to such other persons as may be prescribed. There is no clear link between that and the functions the Bill gives to the Minister to make orders and regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is correct in what he says, the Bill will lose nothing but will gain in clarity from having this clearly set out in the definition.  If I am right, and there is a doubt, the Bill can only gain. It may be a pleonasm in most cases in this Bill to make that clear, where it is not, it will be an advantage.  The Minister has shown very diligent attention elsewhere in the Bill to tying everything up and I suggest this should be done here. I suggest the House would applaud the Minister for perfecting the terms of the Bill.  We find time after time the Minister is given power to prescribe, to make regulations, to give directives and all the rest, and we have the omnibus provisions where the Minister is given an exhaustive list of powers or cases in which he can make regulations, directives or orders and to be sure we have the belt and braces approach to such other matters as the Minister may see appropriate.  I suggest that that concern, if not mania, with perfection in the parts of the Bill that give power to the Minister, should at least be partially reflected in this Part so that <Col N="995" /> there is no doubt who does the prescribing in the cases I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If I thought it was necessary to perfect the Bill, I would have no hesitation in agreeing with Deputy Dukes, but I do not think so.  The link is there.  The link is the definition section, and this section provides the link to the other matters the Deputy referred to.  In effect, section 3 gives the Minister power to make regulations.  This is a drafting device which the Deputy knows is used in other legislation and there is no need for the cross-over mechanism to achieve what he is saying.  The link is established in the definition section and that link goes right through the Bill.  There is no need for what the Deputy suggests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all worked on Bills.  The tenor of a Bill and its progress through the House is often tempered by the attitude of the sponsoring Minister.  I worked on the Child Care Bill and the Minister was very amenable to listening to arguments from this side of the House. There clearly is no harm incorporating the words in this amendment.  From the point of view of clarity they are an addition to the Bill and in my view they <Col N="996" /> are a necessary safeguard.  The definition simply says that the Minister may make regulations, end of story.  As section 3 (1) is currently worded, it gives all embracing and encompassing powers to the Minister to make regulations as he sees fit.  We will deal with section 3 shortly, but until we do I think the amendment helps to achieve clarity and signals to all Members that there will be a restraining mechanism on the Minister, some sort of monitoring mechanism which I would like to see enshrined in the provision.  I am anxious to press this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always believed it is useful to be accommodating but including items that are unnecessary in a section is bad drafting and bad legislation.  While it can be accommodating on occasions to do that to satisfy a particular thing, it is not necessary on this occasion because the link is there and is well established in precedents in other Acts.  Why alter a practice that has achieved the desired results over so many years?  It would be unnecessary, superfluous.  Since that does not make for good legislation or good drafting, I must oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5a:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" />&ldquo;3.&mdash;The Oireachtas shall enact such further Acts as are necessary for the general purposes or for any particular purpose of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is at the centre of the concerns many of us have with this Bill. This section deals with the way in which the Minister is given powers to make a number of provisions in every part of this Bill.  They are wide-ranging powers some of which take back powers which the Bill appears to give to the local authorities. Basically, these powers are given to the Minister by regulations or orders which have to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These regulations or orders are in two forms.  The first is the form in which a draft regulation or order is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and it becomes effective, unless within 21 sitting days either or both Houses of the Oireachtas annul the order or regulation. The second form is the active form of those regulations or orders in which a draft is laid before the House and the order or regulation comes into effect only if the Houses of the Oireachtas pass it. Of the two forms I prefer the second.</P>
    <P>As a parliamentarian, as a democrat and as one who has experience over some years of bringing legislation before this House I know how convenient these forms of orders and regulations are for the Government and how inconvenient they are for the Houses of the Oireachtas and for the process of democracy.  They have their place in the scheme of things although we should have a rethink about them.  There are a great many matters that come before this House on which we are required to legislate but where there is clearly a function which devolves on the Government and the administration of the day to carry them into effect.  We have not yet gone deeply enough into the distinction that needs to be made between the legislative function and the executive or administrative function. These orders and regulations are not the appropriate way of doing that in all cases. I see some point in them, in matters of detail, and I am not being insulting to the <Col N="1000" /> Minister or the Government when I say, in the full knowledge that I have used these instruments in the past, that it is unwise of a legislative assembly to leave too much to Ministers.  It is unwise for legislative assemblies to get too much into the nitty-gritty of day-to-day administration, but these orders and regulations are not the way to draw the line between what is appropriately a legislative function and what is properly an executive or administrative function.  They are a very blunt, unsatisfactory instrument.</P>
    <P>If we have to have orders or regulations of that kind, I prefer the active kind.  I instinctively react against a system which says that something which the Minister or the Government might want to do will be done unless within 21 sitting days the Houses of the Oireachtas decide otherwise, because in practice that leaves very little margin to the Houses of the Oireachtas, and it invites the Houses of the Oireachtas who may be preoccupied with other things and inclined to be lazy about going into the detail of legislation, to let legislation go through by default. That is not in the interest of democracy nor in the interest of good legislation or good administration.  Of the two forms of regulation or orders I have a clear preference for the active kind.  I am not betraying any confidence when I say that during the time when I had the honour, as a Minister, of bringing legislation before this House, I argued, not always successfully, in favour of using the active form of those instruments rather than the passive form, if only for the reason that I believed we should do this House the honour of requiring it to express a view before action was taken.</P>
    <P>I know the basic nature of the provision being made here is standard in legislation. It is to be found in legislation of all kinds that comes before us, and if the Minister is well briefed, he probably has a raft of precedents to quote to me.  My reaction would be to say: &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; These are not good intruments.  I do not think that the fact that our legislation from 1922 to date is littered with such instruments is good reason for continuing <Col N="1001" /> with them.  At a time when two intergovernmental conferences to do with the future of the EC are considering the very question of a hierarchy of laws and instruments to be enacted by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament on proposals from the Commission, we should at least be thinking of examining our own legislative process in the same way.</P>
    <P>Those two forms of instruments are not satisfactory ones either from a legislative point of view or from a democratic point of view.  That reservation applies with even greater force to the Bill under debate.  I do not like those forms of instruments &mdash; they are unsatisfactory and they are undemocratic.  If they do have any relevance in our legislative and administrative process, then they are surely relevant only to matters of the detail of implementation of the legislation.  One could stretch a point and say that in that kind of context they may have a place. However, they most certainly do not have a place in a Bill such as this, which sets out, as the Minister says, to bring about reforms to local government.  In fact, the Bill provides for a series of cosmetic reforms to local government but accompanies each one of those cosmetic reforms with an instantaneous power for the Minister to set aside that apparent reform &mdash; that is found time after time in the Bill.  On every occasion that a new power is apparently given to local authorities with the one hand it is taken back with the other hand, in that the Minister is given power to make regulations or orders that direct, constrain, or prevent local authorities from using the new power apparently given by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The circulated sheet setting out my amendment includes the statement that acceptance of the amendment involves the deletion of section 3.  That is quite true, but it does much more than that. Not only does the amendment require deletion of section 3, it would also require substantial consequential amendments to sections 9, 12, 24, 31, 33, 34, 40, 41, 43, 47, 51, 52 and 53.  I list those sections not in the interests of boring the pants off <Col N="1002" /> Members but to illustrate how completely infused is the Bill with that particular way of giving the Minister extra powers &mdash; powers of interference and powers of direction.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, when speaking to a previous amendment, much of what is proposed in the Bill to be carried out by order or by regulation should not be carried out in that way but should be done by bringing Bills before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that law is made.  It has been established earlier this evening that in the setting up of the three new local government structures for Dublin the Minister intends to go further than the Bill suggests and to bring in new legislation, in spite of the fact that under the Bill he has comprehensive powers to make orders and regulations.</P>
    <P>For the record of the House I should like to point out how much it just means to review the appropriateness of those regulations and orders.  The first section to be affected, which would have to be extensively rewritten on foot of my amendment, is section 9.  Section 9 deals with the transfer of certain functions to local authorities.  The Bill provides new functions to local authorities, yet it allows the Minister, by regulation or by order, to interfere with those new functions.  In section 9 is found an animal unfamiliar to me.  In section 9 one finds reference to &ldquo;provisional orders&rdquo;.  I do not know the difference between provisional orders and plain, simple, straightforward orders, but it seems that this is one instance in which the Government think they might want to secondguess themselves after a while and change their mind about an order.  The section gives power to the Minister to transfer, not to transfer, or to take back powers, transferred to local authorities by order.  I think &mdash; and I hope that Deputies will agree with me &mdash; that the business of giving new powers to local authorities is so fundamental and so central to the reform of local government that it should be done in a way that requires the House to think very carefully about it and about which the Minister should not be able to change his mind six months or a year later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> Members should not forget that the Bill contains an omnibus provision, a catchall provision, that allows the Minister by order to revoke or vary any regulation or order previously made under the terms of the Bill.  The Minister always has the power, by passive order in the House or by active order, to change his mind.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the designation of local electorate areas in county boroughs. Again that seems to me to be a matter for legislation rather than for the making of orders.</P>
    <P>I shall have to hurry now, I do not have much time because of this guillotine. Section 24 is one of the sections dealing with reorganisation and the creation of three new local authorities in Dublin. Members have already learnt from the Minister that he intends to introduce legislation in that regard, and I am glad to hear that.  I hope that he does not change his mind about it.</P>

I am glad to receive confirmation that at least there, whatever regulations or orders may have been made for this stage of preparation and transition, the Houses of the Oireachtas will be able to decide on what the final shape is to be.  I am also glad that the Minister accepts that because in giving that confirmation in the Chamber this evening he has accepted my point. The issue is much too important for the local government system and for local democracy to be carried out simply by order or regulation made by the Minister under the provisions of section 3.</P>
      <P>Section 31 deals with the Minister's powers to alter boundaries by order. Again I do not wish to insult the Minister, and I hope that the Minister accepts that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> I do not believe that any Minister for the Environment, no matter who he or she might be, should be given the power to alter boundaries by order.  We all know that orders, be they passive or active, are not scrutinised fully in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 33 contains a similar provision that deals with reports made by boundary committees.  There could be an argument about that.  Section 34 deals with provisions consequential to boundary alterations. There again, orders can be made. And so on and so on.  I shall not go into the full list because it is long and tedious. My essential point is that most of those functions are so important that they should not be allowed to be carried through by an order that may never be debated in the House.  Even if the orders are debated in the House there is still a problem.  If the order is a passive one, then its draft is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and unless it is annulled within 21 sitting days the measure has effect.  Even if it is annulled within 21 sitting days, nothing done on foot of that order while it was before the Houses before those 21 days have elapsed shall be illegal.  It will have its effect.  If it is an inactive order it is laid before the Houses and it will not come into effect until the Houses actually confirm it.  But what choice is given to the Houses of the Oireachtas?  They have only two choices &mdash; they can either accept it or reject it. There is no provision under which a draft regulation or a draft order that comes before this House, whether it is an active or passive one, can be modified by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Let us look again at the kinds of provisions we are talking about here.  Section 9, in respect of which these regulations and orders may be made, deals with the transfer of certain functions to local authorities. I could very easily conceive of a situation in which the Minister might come before the House saying he wants to transfer X, Y or Z function to local authorities, and it is curious that in this Bill one of the few cases where active orders are required is where the Minister for the Environment or another Minister, <Col N="1005" /> with the agreement of the Minister for the Environment, is transferring a function of another Minister to a local authority. The Government believe that should be an active decision of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but most of the others under section 3 are passive; they can be done like a thief in the night. It is conceivable at the very least &mdash; and I would say probable &mdash; that the Minister for the Environment of the day might wish to transfer certain functions to local authorities and that there would be a strong view in this House that either we wanted more functions transferred to the local authorities or we did not.  The Minister does not have all wisdom.  He is not omniscient &mdash; and I will pay him the compliment of believing that he agrees with that &mdash; but there are many different views on the degree to which we should transfer separate functions to local authorities. I think that, on the whole, the view of this House would be that the more that can be transferred the better in the interests of local democracy.  There is certainly room for argument, and I do not think the Houses of the Oireachtas should be faced with the choice of accepting <i>holus bolus</i> what the Minister proposes or rejecting it, because the Houses of the Oireachtas might want to agree with a large part of what the Minister says or they might wish to go further than he proposes.  That is section 9.</P>
    <P>Section 12 has to deal with the definition of local electoral areas in county boroughs.  Here again it seems to be not at all unlikely that there would be different views in the Houses of the Oireachtas as to what the Minister might propose. Let me take a purely hypothetical example, and this is all the more hypothetical because we are going to abolish the town commissioners next year.  It might appear to the Newbridge Town Commissioners that they would like to see the townlands of Greatconnell, Littleconnell, Roseberry and others added into the area of the town commissioners and that the Minister for the Environment, having reflected on it, might say they can have Greatconnell and Littleconnell but not Roseberry.  An order <Col N="1006" /> might come before this House and I, having been much more closely in touch with the grassroots in Newbridge than the Minister could conceivably be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is conceivable, Sir, that the House might want to take a different view about the additions we make to the town commissioners area in Newbridge, and I object to a procedure where this House does not have that option: it can accept what the Minister is saying <i>holus bolus</i> or it has to reject it.</P>
      <P>I will not speak about the Dublin reorganisation because it seems we are to have legislation on that.

      <P>Part VI deals with committees and joint committees of local authorities.  I find it not at all improbable that the Houses of the Oireachtas might take a different view from the Minister, particularly where, under the terms of his Bill the Minister will be directing local authorities to set up committees &mdash; not asking them, not advising them, but directing them to set up committees.

      <P>When you are dealing with this Minister, they are few and far between.  What do I find in Part VI of the Bill dealing with committees and joint committees of local authorities?  I find the Minister has all kinds of powers.  He can even direct local authorities to set up committees and joint committees; but can he even suggest to them that they set up committees of agriculture as we used to know them?  The answer is no.  They are not provided for and, as far as I can see, using all the ingenuity and mental flexibility at my disposal, there is no way I can see that the committees of agriculture promised by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to Fianna Fáil councillors in Athlone last week can be accommodated under this Bill.  What will the Minister do about that?  Are we to have an amendment on Committee Stage?</P>

      <P>We come now to one of the provisions that are at the heart of the concerns of Opposition Deputies.  We come to Part VII, Miscellaneous, and section 41 in particular, which covers reserved functions.  This has to do with <Col N="1009" /> the degree to which members of local authorities actually have influence over the policies of local authorities.  It has to do in particular with the relationship between the functions of elected members of local authorities and the functions of the managers, one of the key issues in local democracy and one of the issues &mdash; and the Minister cannot be unaware of this &mdash; which is causing most heart burn, heartache and frustration to members of local authorities all over the country.</P>
      <P>Just in case anything were to escape, section 41 (2) provides that: &ldquo;The Minister may by order declare that a specified function or specified functions of local authorities shall be performed by resolution of the members of the authorities&rdquo;. Under the provisions of section 3 of this Bill that is one of those passive orders.</P>

That is why the Taoiseach said in this House just the other day that there are members of local authorities with sense, some of them in Fianna Fáil, who are thinking of not standing again because they are browned off with having no functions.  The are browned off having to tell their constituents day in and day out that although a particular matter is of great concern to that constituent, to the community and to everybody who has half an eye, the councillor has no function in it because it is not a reserved function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not bother his head.  I know it by heart.  The Minister has shown not the slightest readiness of intent to do this but even if he did my submission is that that matter is so important and so central to local democracy that the Houses of the Oireachtas should provide for it by a law, not by an order that will pass through these Houses which cannot be amended by the Houses of the Oireachtas unless, in this case, within 21 sitting days they decide to do something else.  The only other thing the Houses of the Oireachtas can decide to do is not to agree with the Minister.  If the Minister decides to add one more function as a reserved function and the Houses of the Oireachtas think two more should be added, all they can do is accept the Minister's proposal or add no function.  That is utterly unsatisfactory, totally undemocratic and, as a purely administrative measure, it is out of place in a Bill which is dealing with the political responsibility of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go on further.  There are many more sections in this Bill that are of concern and I have listed them all.  My submission is that in most of the sections in this Bill under which orders or regulations can be made by the Minister, the <Col N="1011" /> matter involved is so important that it should more properly be the subject of a law, a separate Bill, conscientiously passed by this House with some notion in mind of the structure of local democracy that we are to bring about, rather than take the form of an order or a regulation that is far more suitable to the minor details of day-to-day administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be concise on this issue which is extremely important and central to the operation of the Bill. I referred to it in relation to amendment No. 4 in my name and we are at the issue now.  Section 3 of the Bill is all-encompassing and gives tremendous scope and power to the Minister.  Section 3 (1) provides that: &ldquo;The Minister may make regulations for the general purposes or for any particular purpose of this Act&rdquo;.  He can do it for any general purpose or for any specific purpose.  Basically, that sentence gives sweeping powers to the Minister himself to legislate &mdash; because that is what he is doing &mdash; in respect of virtually any aspect of local government.  There are different models before us in relation to progressing this matter.  Deputy Dukes has given a very comprehensive overview of where the regulations will come into effect.  They reach into virtually every aspect of this Bill.  It underscores what we have been saying on this side of the House since the Bill was published, that it is not devolution of powers, it is an enabling provision for the Minister to have all powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We go back to the principle I enunciated earlier, and the Minister was at least kind enough to say I was consistent on it in relation to other legislation, that is how provisions enacted by this House and by the Oireachtas become the law of the land.  We have three models before us.  There is amendment No. 5a, proposed eloquently and forcibly by Deputy Dukes, that provides in essence that matters of substance, matters of fundamental policy should not be the prerogative of any one Minister or his civil servants.  In relation to regulations there are two other models.  One is the positive affirmative <Col N="1012" /> motion passed by this House and the other is the passive annulling provision that requires an annulling motion not only to get on to the floor of this House, which would be a difficult enough proposition if the Government of the day decided to be obstructive, but to be passed by a majority of Members within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>Of those three provisions the last is totally undemocratic in my view.  It seeks to circumvent public scrutiny by the elected Members of this House.  I am a party Whip.  I know how difficult it is to get any motion, any report on to the Order Paper of this House.  Every Thursday we debated dozens of them, queueing up to seek parliamentary time, and often we agree to allow things go through without debate in order that they will be enacted to give effect to provisions that are important for this country.  It is clear that very important provisions that will come onstream subsequent to the enactment of this legislation will not be properly monitored or properly scrutinised if we depend largely or substantially on the passive method of regulations by the Department requiring only to be made and to have automatic effect unless they are annulled.  It is extremely dangerous and it is going to the essence of what I said previously: it is a bad way to do our business and it is a way we depend on increasingly.  Government Ministers seem to give more and more authority to themselves to act by way of enabling provision.</P>
    <P>I have tabled amendments on this section.  Deputy Dukes' amendment is an alternative on which I look very favourably. It seeks that the substantive and important pieces of policy that are subsequent to this legislation would require enactment on their own account by this House and the other House.  That is a sensible, good provision.</P>
    <P>In my related amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 13 to section 3 I seek to delimit the powers of the Minister to act in this way and to extend the powers of scrutiny of this House.  Amendment No. 6 seeks to provide that the Minister may make regulations subject to subsection (4).  I seek <Col N="1013" /> in amendment No. 13 to write in a new subsection (4) to provide that: &ldquo;A draft of any regulation or order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order or regulation, as the case may be, shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.  That is the subsection I would put in in place of existing subsection (4).  My amendment No. 6 is linked to that and provides that the Minister would be able to make regulations but only in accordance with a positive resolution of this House.  That is an infinitely safer, more democratic and more accountable way of doing business than simply churning out regulations and orders of fundamental policy and not of irrelevant or ancillary or by the way issues.  Fundamental policies churned out by the Custom House frequently go unnoticed by Members of this House and certainly are never drawn positively to the attention of Members by way of tabling them on the Floor of the House for positive acceptance or rejection.</P>
    <P>This is at the core of how we do our business and it is particularly suitable to a Bill that seeks to broaden the democratic scope.  If we seek to give real powers at local level, if we seek to strengthen the democratic process then we must start by enhancing our own democratic procedures. The powers of scrutiny and policy that should be held in this Chamber, should be subject to the positive impact of all the Members of this House and not kept for one individual who happens to be an office holder for the time being and his officials.  This is absolutely fundamental.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 in my name which is related, seeks to delete the phrase, &ldquo;for the general purposes or&rdquo; from this section.  Subsection (1) is all encompassing and gives frightening powers to the Minister.  He can do virtually what he likes.  Section 3 (1) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may make regulations for the general purposes or for any particular purpose of this Act.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 7 I seek to leave to the Minister, subject to the insertion of <Col N="1014" /> the new subsection (4), the authority to make regulations for the particulars of this Act.  That is a good way of going about our business.  Any regulations or orders consequent on this Act when enacted should come before us for positive vetting.  I wish to remove from the Minister the power to make regulations for the general purposes.  Will the Minister expand on that?  The Minister can make regulations to do virtually anything that is connected with the general purposes of this Bill; the &ldquo;general purposes&rdquo; of this Bill is local government.  The general purposes then would give the Minister the power to make regulations on any aspect of local government as he sees fit.  Clearly that is a frightening power which I, and the Labour Party, would be unwilling to vest in any Minister and certainly not in the present Minister.</P>
    <P>Those two amendments are clearcut. First, they seek to make it conditional on all regulations and orders that are consequent on this Bill to be put before the House and require positive resolution before they can have effect.  Second, they seek to remove from the Minister the power to make regulations or orders for the general purposes of this provision. I hope the Minister will accept that he does not need and should not have, in any democracy, that level of all embracing power.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 in my name seeks to substitute the existing subsection (4) with the new subsection (4) which is a requirement for a positive resolution to be put before the House.  I hope the import and the focus of my amendments are clear.  I will not detail how they affect other sections.  It is clear from previous contributions, and from the knowledge which everybody present has, that the methodolgy by which most of the Bill comes into effect is central to virtually every section.  It is important that we tease this out very carefully.  The fundamental principle I seek to enshrine is democratic accountability, democratic scrutiny and to vest real power not in any office holder or bureaucratic support which that office holder may have but in the elected representatives of this House.</P>
    <Col N="1015" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment tabled by Deputy Dukes because it conforms with the proposal I have included in the list of amendments which oppose section 3.  When the Minister is replying he will probably argue that section 3 is the kind of general section which enables a Minister to make regulations under an Act passed by the Oireachtas.  He will probably refer us to other legislation where similar provisions are made.  If this was, say, a Wildlife Bill, it would be understandable that the Minister would have the power to make regulations dealing with the kind of flora and fauna which could be protected in a particular way.  I referred on an earlier Stage to the Building Control Act which enabled the Minister to make regulations about fire safety, building regulations, building standards and so on, all of which are technical matters and would not be the kind of matters that would normally come for debate before this House.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding my experience of Dublin County Council this is not a Wildlife Bill, this is a Bill about democracy. What is being proposed by the Minister in section 3, the most fundamental section of the Bill, is that the Oireachtas will transfer to the Minister the power to make regulations about any aspect of local government for the future.  Those have been referred to and listed before. The Minister will have powers to make regulations in relation to the functions of local authorities.  He can make regulations about how local authorities carry out those functions within particular areas of their functional area.  He can make regulations about what powers will be devolved to local authorities.  The regional authorities that are supposed to be established will be established by regulation. Earlier the Minister clarified the position regarding the reorganisation of local government in Dublin.  Apparently there will be additional legislation but in the meantime the Minister will have the power to make various regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is asking this House to give him a very wide-ranging power.  If we look at some of the particulars we will see he is proposing that regulations under <Col N="1016" /> this Bill may apply to local authorities generally or to a specified class or classes of local authorities or to a particular local authority.  In other words, he can make one set of regulations for one local authority and another set of regulations for another local authority or even for a particular part of the functional area of a local authority.  Regulations can contain different provisions in relation to different local authorities.  The Minister can literally make one set of regulations for a local authority, the political composition of which he may be sympathetic to and another set of regulations for a different local authority if he so chooses.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill which delimits his power.  He can make any regulations for the general purposes or particular purpose of this Bill.  It is an omnibus section which is intended to transfer to the Minister any power he wants to exercise in relation to local government.</P>
    <P>The Bill is basically about establishing structures of local democracy.  It seems to me to be highly undemocratic that the powers of the democratically elected parliament of the country are transferred to the Minister.  There is much talk these days about the democratic deficit in the European context.  We would be adding to that if we passed this section.  We would be undermining the democratic legitimacy of this House and of local democracy if we allowed local authorities to be established in a quite undemocratic way, if their powers are delimited and if the Minister's hand is seen in this.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Dukes is very much in line with my thinking on this matter.  If we take the issue of the devolution of powers to local authorities, that is to be effected, as Deputy Dukes pointed out, under section 9 whereby the Minister can by regulation or by order devolve functions to local authorities.  I very much doubt if there will be a great rush by the Minister for the Environment to make regulations to devolve powers to local authorities.  In a later amendment, amendment No. 74 which I have tabled, I propose a formula <Col N="1017" /> whereby over a period of a year Government Departments would assemble and identify the functions which they can devolve to local authorities; those functions would then be brought before the House in the form of a local government devolution Bill whereby this House would decide to devolve powers to local authorities.  That is the proper procedure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin said that different options are being addressed here.  One is the Minister's option to give to the Minister the power to make regulations about any matter relating to local government, on how powers might be devolved, structures established and so on.  A second approach, the one taken by Deputy Howlin, is to allow for a provision in the Bill whereby the Minister can make regulations but to restrict that to circumstances where the regulations would be brought before this House and where the particular circumstances referred to on page 7 of the Bill would be delimited.</P>
    <P>Looking at the list of amendments I was surprised that Deputy Mitchell did not choose the road that has been chosen by Deputy Dukes, who when the Bill was published correctly identified that the Bill was about transferring substantial powers to the Minister for the Environment. Therefore I was somewhat surprised that in the amendments in his name Deputy Mitchell confined himself to fairly marginal modification of the rights and powers of the Minister to make regulations.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, Deputy Dukes's proposal is very much in harmony with the approach I have taken.  He is opposed to section 3 of the Bill and, in the amendments to later sections, sets down in some detail the way in which local government should continue to be reformed by legislation being brought before this House, debated here and passed in the normal way rather than by regulations which as we know will never be brought before the House.  Even though there is a procedure for annulling regulations we know it is, in practice, impossible to do that.  This House has a very unhappy record in dealing with regulations.  For example, if this Bill is passed and we want to raise a <Col N="1018" /> question about whether the Minister is going to introduce, say, regulations for the establishment of regional authorities, it will not be allowed in this House.  We are then confined to tabling questions in the normal way, once every three or four months when the Minister comes in to answer questions.  As is often the case the Minister takes many questions together and therefore important questions are very often taken with less contentious questions which are down for priority.  In that way the Minister avoids answering supplementaries.</P>
    <P>The passing of section 3 of the Bill would effectively transfer to the Minister powers which should belong to the House.  This legislation is not dealing with some technical area or some area that could in the normal sense be dealt with by way of regulation; it is about a fundamental issue of democracy.  The future structures of democracy at local level should not be decided by regulation or by ministerial order.  They are matters which should properly be brought before this House, debated and put through in the normal way.  Enormous powers will be transferred to the Minister if section 3 is passed, and for those reasons I support the amendment tabled by Deputy Dukes.</P>

      <P>I too am concerned about the issue of local democracy raised by Deputy Gilmore.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1985 refers to the devolution of functions to local authorities.  It states:</P>
      <P>Local authorities are the only directly elected bodies outside the Oireachtas and reflect the political aspirations of people in different localities.  In most cases the elected members and officers are very close to the people.  Decision-making must be at local level to be most effective.</P>
      <P>They cast a reflection on what was going on at that time, but now they say the opposite is the case.  It also states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central control of local authorities and the range of services which they provide is more stringent in <Col N="1019" /> Ireland than elsewhere in Western Europe.  Fianna Fáil, if returned to Government, believe that the time has come to reverse this trend and to return power to the people.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that aspiration of the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition, it defeats the whole purpose of local democracy that they should now come in with a Local Government Bill which includes a section stating that the Minister may make regulations for the general purposes or any particular purpose of this Act.  I would certainly oppose that section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was supposed to be about the strengthening of local democracy and was to bring about real reform, but in effect the provisions put forward by the Minister are tearing apart whatever structures remain.  The Minister is taking powers as he wishes and will use them, as he has done in the past, in an arbitrary way depending on the political composition of the local authorities involved.  The powers he is taking should be subject to a decision of this House.  As that is not the case we put down amendments to prevent the Minister taking these powers.  As has been proven in the past, the Minister cannot be trusted; we have given examples earlier of how he has used certain powers. This has been a long debate and the Minister should be given an opportunity to respond, particularly to the very detailed contribution from Deputy Dukes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because section 3 is the central and most undemocratic section.  In essence, what Deputy Howlin is trying to do in amendment No. 13 is to require that every order or regulation to be made under this Bill needs to be <Col N="1020" /> approved in draft by both Houses.  There is a big question of principle attached to this.  Deputy Howlin is consistent because in every Bill in which he is involved he states the same thing.  However, I should like to ask him if he has seen a bad result in the continuation of the practice in all other Bills to which he was opposed on the very same principle?  Of course he has not, but he has a principle to pursue and he will do so, irrespective of whether it is nonsense.</P>

      <P>We would need to sit for that length of time to achieve what Deputy Howlin, Deputy Dukes and others seek in regard to regulations.  This is the reality of what the Deputies are proposing.  However, it has not been pursued unanimously.  It was suggested by Deputy Gilmore that Deputy Jim Mitchell did not support that point of view; he is right.  Deputy Jim Mitchell was quite happy to support the Bill but he wanted some little adjustments in regard to draft as against the ordinary way of regulation.  That opinion is not shared by Deputy Dukes, fair enough, but it shows that there is not a consensus on the matter.</P>

      <P>The more detailed matters are left to subsidiary legislation and this is the basic principle in formulating a workable, primary Bill.  That has been the <i>modus operandi</i> in dealing with legislation for years.  It is the question of principle in that area which we must decide this evening and it does not mean that the Dáil is not involved; on the contrary, every regulation made under this Bill will come before the Dáil and the more important ones will have to be approved in draft before they can be made.  All the others must be laid before both Houses and are subject to annulment by resolution of either House within 21 sitting days.  Thus, Parliament retains absolute control and nobody has suggested it should be otherwise.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, amendment No. 13 is uncalled for and the Deputies opposite know that from their time in Government &mdash; this applies particularly to Deputy Dukes.  The power to make regulations is a necessary part of the legislative process and it is unrealistic to speak of every regulation coming before the House for approval.</P>
      <P>As I said, Deputy Howlin wants every single regulation to be laid in draft before both Houses and approved by them but we are talking about the question of whether we believe in the principle of subsidiary legislation.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 5a tabled by Deputy Dukes is at odds with other amendments tabled by Deputy Jim Mitchell. He requires only certain orders and regulations to be approved in draft but Deputy Howlin wants all orders to be approved in draft.  Deputy Dukes goes one step further; he wants to replace the entire regulation-making process with primary legislation, which is extraordinary, considering his experience in these matters.  He drew attention to that in a reflective way from his time in Government as if there was something inherently wrong or basically flawed in a lot of the things he did while in Government. I do not think that is so.  He had the legislation available to him to act in a proper manner and used it accordingly. He should not now seek to tell the House that he was making mistakes all the time.</P>

      <P>The detailed procedures in this legislation regarding the bodies which would have to be consulted, the details to be included in the application for these boundaries and the type of public notice would all have to be done by way of a Bill.  Can Deputy Dukes really be serious about this, considering his long experience in Government? Deputy Dukes went further and spoke about provisional orders.  I was taken aback by his reference to this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>He suggested that this was a new kind of legislative animal and that it would have a temporary effect.  Deputy Dukes knows that provisional orders are a well established device in local government law.  They involve an order dealing with a matter of major importance and should be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  Section 9 (1) (d) deals with an expressly provides for that.  Devolution of powers is a matter of singular importance and deserves very special treatment &mdash; I agree with Deputy Dukes in that regard &mdash; but to suggest, that all the other matters which arise in implementing the Bill deserve similar treatment is pushing it too far and is not realistic.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes made the major contribution so I will confine most of my remarks in response to it.  Deputy Howlin's position is well known and it did not change in regard to this legislation in so far as the powers of the Minister are concerned.  He does not want any Minister to have power to do anything but would like him to be trotting in here day and night looking for rights and powers in relation to ordinary mundane things attached to implementation of legislation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has objected to the current regulation procedures.  It appears therefore that he has had a change of heart since his time in Government.  The Deputy knows full well that this procedure has applied for many years, including the time when he himself was in Government.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we would find ourselves in a very difficult position.  I am aware of Deputy Howlin's position as he has stated it in the House on a number of occasions.  Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Dukes hold differing points of view again but the question which must be asked here is whether there is role for subsidiary legislation in dealing with Acts of the <Col N="1027" /> Oireachtas.  I say that there is and I am prepared to put it to the test.  This must be enshrined in legislation so that effective legislation can be put in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that I have ever heard. He tried in his usual fashion to cloud every issue and is using the old Aunt Sally technique.  He is saying, &ldquo;if you propose this, it is so daft that you cannot be right&rdquo;. I did not propose at any time what he said I proposed.  He is doubly wrong. The Minister followed the old practice of <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i>  There is some <i>reductio</i> in this and some absurdity in the Minister's new proposal.  The system was utterly and totally bureaucratic.  I am astonished that a man of the Minister's background could succumb to such extent to the bureaucracy of the Custom House.</P>
      <P>I am not going to go into the kind of political mischief the Minister is attempting to foment any more than I am going to go into the kind of mischief that Deputy Gilmore is trying to foment because they are distractions and have nothing to do with the issue before us.  The issue before us is the one the Minister nearly identified and that is the question of what is the proper balance, dividing line or demarcation between primary legislation, subsidiary legislation and day-to-day administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House sets out a particular balance.  It states that the Oireachtas shall be asked to pass primary legislation which does nothing more than give very general guidelines to what the Minister says is only a small part or the beginning of a process of local government reform.  We were told by the Minister and Deputy Kitt earlier that this Bill only marks the beginning of a process. The Minister wants the House to pass very general guidelines for a part of that process and to leave all the real decisions <Col N="1028" /> involved to him under what he chooses to call the subsidiary legislation process of laying draft orders, or of orders which may be annulled, before the House.</P>
    <P>I said that the amendments I have proposed would require consequential amendments to 13 sections of the Bill. The Minister has not even begun to divine what those consequential amendments might be.  He has launched into this extraordinary, extravagant and even &ldquo;Flinstonian&rdquo; process of what the French call <i>un procès d'intention:</i>&ldquo;I think you might have something in your mind that I do not like, therefore I am going to criticise what I think you might have in your mind whether it is there or not&rdquo;.  I would like to remind the Minister that I did raise the question of the proper balance between primary legislation, subsidiary legislation and day-to-day administration.  This Bill does not achieve that proper balance in an area as important as local government reform.  Why?  Because it leaves far too much power in the hands of the Minister to be carried out by regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Perhaps, in the order of political events of the day, it may seem insignificant but to the Ballyheigue Development Association, it is a matter of extreme importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First I will give some background information to the House.  Last year under their amenity grant scheme, Kerry County Council paid an amenity grant to Ballyheighue Development Association <Col N="1029" /> to carry out work on the beach at Ballyheigue. The work was part of a two part programme, first to carry out general improvements to the beach and to extend the promenade and second to carry out some works in relation to coastal erosion. The work was funded by way of a direct grant from the Department of the Environment to Kerry County Council which was topped up by a 40 per cent contribution from Kerry County Council.  At this stage the work is incomplete and Ballyheigue Development Association are awaiting the allocation for this year. I understand that an application has been lodged with the Department.</P>
    <P>Unless confirmation is given within days that the grant will be extended, the workers on the scheme will have to be laid off and there will be a break in the work.  The development association had hoped that the work would take place prior to the summer tourist season.  Obviously, from the amenity value of Ballyheigue beach, one of the finer beaches in County Kerry, it is important that the work is carried out as soon a possible.  I understand from the Department of the Environment that the file is on the Minister's desk.  The Minister for the Environment has received deputations from Ballyheigue Development Association but they did not know at the time that the Minister of State has responsibility for grant allocations in these matters. The development association were very disappointed to learn that their deputation was in vain because they were talking to the wrong person.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has responsibility for distributing the funds of £500,000 that are available.  I urge the Minister tonight to make the decision as quickly as possible to complete the work that commenced last year and commence the new project.  However, if the allocation is not made within the next couple of days &mdash; I understand the allocation will be forthcoming sometime during 1991 &mdash; the county council workers cannot continue to work on site.  Work to extend the promenade, and the continuing work to prevent coastal erosion, which is an ongoing problem should be continued.  It <Col N="1030" /> would certainly be more professional and workmanlike if the grant was made available now.  Kerry County Council have their portion of the money in reserve and are only waiting for approval from the Department.  As soon as the grant is available from the Department it will be topped up by Kerry County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Spring for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  First, let me clarify for him that the files are not on my desk but I hope they will be on my desk within the next two weeks or so.</P>
      <P>In March, the Department advertised the amenity grant scheme for beaches, which amounts to £500,000.  Sixty nine applications were received from the local authorities and at present the applications are being processed.  My Department's inspectorate are in consultation with the local authorities to discuss the applications.  Obviously it will not be possible to grant-aid all 69 beaches and perhaps one but at the most two in each local authority area will be grant-aided. The decision to give grant-aid will very much depend on the priority the local authorities attach to the applications from their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kerry County Council submitted six different beaches for grant-aid and my inspectorate will be discussing those six applications with them and asking Kerry County Council to indicate the priority attaching to each application.  If it is the case that they give Ballyheigue a high priority then, obviously, I would consider that when making the allocation.  As Deputy Spring indicated, money was given for improvement works at Ballyheigue last summer and a sum of £23,000 was allocated under the beach grant scheme.  I hope to be in a position to have the final report from the Department's inspectors within the next week to ten days and then I will be in a position to make a decision.  It is the intention that the moneys will be spent as quickly as possible.  My Department do not give <Col N="1031" /> money directly to development associations. The money is given to local authorities to carry out the works.  This is a scheme of grants provided by the Government for local authorities to allow them improve beach facilities with a view to improving the tourist potential and environmental aspects of our beaches.</P>
    <P>I will certainly take into account the comments made by Deputy Spring and other representatives from the area.  In particular I am anxious to see what priority Kerry County Council attach to this application over and above the other five.  It certainly will not be possible to grant-aid all six applications from Kerry County Council.  I hope to be in a position to grant-aid one but perhaps two at most. Would Deputy Spring consider having discussions with Kerry County Council on behalf of Ballyheigue Devlopment Association?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise in a non-controversial and in a non-sensational way an issue of deep concern in Cork and in the south generally. Cancer is an illness that rightly gives rise to tremendous public sympathy and support. The Minister for Health should be fully aware that the general public want the best of treatment to be available to those who suffer from cancer.  As of now, radiotherapy treatment is not available for many cancer patients in the south. About 1,500 patients from Cork city and county, Kerry, south Limerick, south Tipperary and west Waterford attend annually at the regional hospital for such treatment.</P>
      <P>The reason I raised this issue is that the 13-year-old radiotherapy machine has broken down.  The machine is at the end of its normal functioning life and arrangements have been put in place to replace it.  I am aware that a huge fund raising effort over the last two years by a very admirable local charity group will result in a new cancer machine being operational in the hospital very soon.  I have been told that while this machine will not replace the existing cobalt machine it will provide additional facilities for cancer treatment in Cork Regional Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to another matter which is of some concern to me.  The impression has been given that the cobalt machine broke down only a few days ago and that the problem was attended to immediately. The evidence available to me suggests that this impression is misleading. A cancer patient from my area told me that arrangements for his transfer to Dublin were made at the end of last month because of problems with the <Col N="1033" /> machine in question.  Clearly, the difficulties did not arise during the past few days.</P>
    <P>Transferring patients to Dublin is not the answer.  Radio therapy treatment lasts for two or three weeks.  While this treatment may only have five or ten minutes each day, it is not possible for people to commute 250 miles to Dublin daily.  The difficulties will be particularly acute for those from west Cork and Kerry who already have to travel long distances for treatment in the Cork Regional Hospital.  Furthermore for the mothers of young children the logistics of travelling to Dublin for treatment will be a nightmare.</P>
    <P>I am shocked and horrified that the Minister for Health should preside over a service where essential treatment is not available for cancer patients in the south. I demand that he give us a full explanation and confirm, even at this stage, that suitable alternative arrangements will be put in place immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The breakdown of the radiotherapy machine in Cork Regional Hospital is a source of much hardship for many Kerry patients who have to travel to Cork for treatment.  I know of one patient who travelled to Cork last week only to be informed that he could not receive any treatment as the machine was out of order.  This man is very worried and needs treatment urgently.  There is no excuse for allowing this machine to be out of commission for such a considerable period of time in view of the serious condition of some of the patients involved.  I ask the Minister to do something about this matter immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is horrific that cancer patients who suffer extreme anxiety and stress cannot avail of this essential equipment in Cork Regional Hospital.  It is inappropriate that they should have to suffer the additional trauma of travelling to Dublin or Belfast for this treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Keeffe pointed out, this machine broke down some weeks ago. This machine is being repaired but it will break down again because it is on its last <Col N="1034" /> legs.  What we have seen is just the tip of the iceberg.  Some of the equipment in Cork Regional Hospital is outdated and needs to be replaced.  As the Minister is aware, the Southern Health Board have submitted a capital programme to his Department seeking additional funding so that much of this outdated equipment can be replaced.  I urge the Minister to make an early positive decision in regard to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank Deputy O'Keeffe and his colleagues for raising this very important issue here tonight.  All of us accept that it is an important issue, particularly for those who need to use such a facility.</P>
      <P>There are different forms of cancer treatment and cancer patients are catered for at several hospitals throughout Munster. The Deputy is referring to the provision of radiotherapy services which are provided at the radio therapy unit at Cork Regional Hospital and St. Luke's and St. Anne's Hospitals in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Southern Health Board have primary responsibility for the provision and organisation of services at the regional hospital, including radio therapy services. The position is that problems were experienced with the cobalt machine at the radio therapy unit.  As expertise with regard to this machine is not available in this country, the board sought advice from abroad.  The cobalt machine was examined by an expert on 9 May and the board are now awaiting a comprehensive report on the matter which, I understand, will be available next week.  The board will then consider the options open to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the board are finalising arrangements with St. Luke's and St. Anne's Hospitals in Dublin for the provision of radio therapy services for Cork Regional Hospital patients.  As I have sid, St. Luke's and St. Anne's are the only other centres which provide this service. As it is not possible to use the cobalt machine at Cork Regional Hospital it is necessary for patients to travel to Dublin <Col N="1035" /> for treatment.  I understand that every effort is being made by the Southern Health Board to minimise the effects for patients and to provide a comfortable and caring environment for them.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that considerable investment, both State and voluntary, has recently been made in the radio therapy unit at Cork Regional Hospital with the purchase of a linear accelerator.  This is a much more sophisticated radio therapy facility which will substantially improve the treatment for patients and is due to come into operation early in July.  I am confident that this development will further improve radio therapy services for patients in the Munster area.</P>
    <P>Obviously I am also anxious that the report to which I have referred will be made available to the Southern Health Board without delay so that they can make their decision as to whether it is worth bringing the machine back into service or a new machine should be purchased.</P>

    <Title>Dublin Bus Company.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Minister is aware, the Dublin Bus Company are losing money at the rate of about £2 million a year and their problems are being compounded by a loss of passengers. Dublin Bus have argued that they can no longer guarantee an efficient service due to our traffic choked streets.  The only real way to reverse this trend is to allow public transport, and in particular the Dublin Bus Company to provide a passenger service which meets the <Col N="1036" /> requirements of commuters.  This will require making decisions which discriminate against car driving commuters, particularly at peak times, in favour of the users of public transport.  Public transport must be made attractive enough to entice back those people who have abandoned it in favour of their cars.</P>
      <P>Dublin Bus are facing a crisis not because of a lack of competition from other bus companies but because of neglect by this and previous Governments. Despite some improvements and the positive efforts made to make buses a more attractive form of transport the alarm bells are ringing in regard to the viability of Dublin Bus.  I call on the Government to take these warnings seriously.  I ask the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and the Minister for the Environment to co-ordinate their policies to the benefit of Dublin Bus and their commuters.</P>
      <P>I was astounded to hear the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications say at Question Time today that he believed competition for Dublin Bus would improve transport for the people of Dublin.  This is a farcical statement as Dublin Bus are already in competition with an ever growing number of private motorists.  It does not make sense to those who use buses that the Minister seems to want to add to the congestion on our roads by encouraging the use of private buses.  People will not opt to use private buses if they have to travel at the same speed as Dublin Bus and join the same traffic jams.  The slower the bus services, the more attractive it will be for people to use their cars.  This gives rise to the vicious cycle where Dublin Bus lose passengers, demand a greater subvention and increase their bus fares, thus giving rise to a loss of even more passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the use of competition if commuters are stuck in traffic jams?  Unless we allow buses to move more quickly through our streets and attempt to make the service more punctual, clean and efficient, the number of car registrations, which topped the one million mark last year will continue to increase with the <Col N="1037" /> resultant pollution from car fumes.  At peak hours traffic in city streets comes to a standstill.  We in The Workers' Party have called again and again for the reestablishment of the Dublin Transport Authority, to co-ordinate and plan traffic management needs for the capital.  Illegal parking and the disregard for parking regulations are causing havoc.  We need to introduce a rigorous programme, as demanded by Dublin Bus, of wheel clamping of illegally parked cars, and increased fines.  The anti-social behaviour of private motorists on a daily basis must end.</P>
    <P>In the past few years Dublin Bus started to get their act together to meet the demands of the Dublin commuter.  In the past Dublin Bus and management largely contributed to the poor image and poor service the company provided. Both unions and management are agreed that Dublin Bus must move towards the position where they can move the maximum number of commuters comfortably, rapidly, reliably and as cheaply as possible.</P>

We in The Workers' Party do not wish to see taxpayers' money thrown at problems for the sake of it.  Every pound spent should be properly accounted for in providing a valuable service to the public.  The State subsidy to Dublin Bus, at 17 per cent of costs, is the lowest in any European capital city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to deal with this matter if for no other reason than to put at rest some of the wild, dangerous statements that have been made arising from a meeting held yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I would like to explain <Col N="1038" /> that the financial position of Bus Átha Cliath is in the first instance a matter for the board of CIE, the bus company's shareholder.  In this regard, an Extraordinary General Meeting of Bus Átha Cliath was held on 20 February 1991 in compliance with the 1983 Companies (Amendment) Act to notify CIE that the net assets of Bus Átha Cliath are less than half of their called-up share capital.</P>
    <P>However, I want to emphasise in this context that there is no question of a financial crisis in Bus Átha Cliath.  The company are trading normally and are meeting all their obligations as they arise.</P>
    <P>The references in the media to the financial position of Bus Átha Cliath have arisen from a presentation made by the new managing director of the company to the Dublin Corporation Sub-Committee. This presentation was made in response to a request from the sub-committee for Bus Átha Cliath to discuss the company's plans for improved public transport in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>In the course of the presentation, the managing director emphasised the need for improvements in the trading performance of Bus Átha Cliath and added that the company could not continue to incur losses over the next four years on the basis experienced in the past, without facing a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Bus Átha Cliath were not announcing a crisis in their finances, but sounding a warning for the future in relation to the need to improve revenue and control costs so as to secure and consolidate the trading basis of the company.  These comments were made as a prelude to the discussion with the sub-committee on future bus transport options for the city. I support the company's remarks and would encourage the company in the future to take every step possible to improve their financial performance.</P>
    <P>More generally, I would emphasise that the Government are committed to the provision of an efficient and cost-effective public transport system.  In this regard, the Exchequer subvention to CIE in 1991 in respect of essential public transport services will amount to nearly £110 million, that is over £2 million per week <Col N="1039" /> and this level of assistance is very sizeable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about Dublin Bus, not CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy when he was speaking.  It is a matter for the board of CIE as to how they allocate the Exchequer subvention to individual companies within the group. There cannot be a question of additional Exchequer funds being made available to CIE in 1991.</P>
      <P>Since the Government took office we have refused a number of applications from CIE for fare increases.  Instead, the need for further cost economies within their operations and improved marketing to maintain the cost of public transport to the travelling public and to the Exchequer at as low a level as possible has been stressed.</P>
      <P>However, CIE recently had to bear substantial increases in fuel costs as a result of the Gulf crisis.  As these fuel costs were exceptional and entirely outside the control of the group, the Government recognised that some increase in fares, as an exceptional measure, would have to be considered.  Accordingly, approval was given to CIE to increase their bus and rail fares by an average of 7 per cent with effect from 17 December 1990.  This was the first general fares increase since January 1988.  The fares increase will substantially enhance CIE's existing revenues and in particular improve the financial position of Bus Átha Cliath.</P>

      <P>Leitrim is the only Border county without any direct access into Northern Ireland.  This has obtained for the last 18 years when the British Army blew up the roads and barricaded the roads which give direct access from County Leitrim to County Fermanagh. There are 12 crossings from Leitrim to Fermanagh and not one is open.  As the Minister is aware the village of Kiltyclogher and its hinterland has suffered a slow and painful economic death over the past 18 years because direct access to Northern Ireland was extremely important for the economic benefit of the area. I raised this in the Dáil on another occasion.  It is important to have at least one Border crossing open between Leitrim and Fermanagh.  Yesterday, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs visited the area and saw the destruction of the economy there and came to realise the number of locals who wish the crossing to be re-opened.  The Minister of State saw for himself one of the last signs of partition in Europe. There is a wall across the canal and the river which borders the two counties.  It is Leitrim's Berlin Wall and it is something that will have to be taken down.  I would ask the Minister and the Government to be very aggressive in requesting the British to at least re-open one Border crossing between both counties.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the comments of Deputy Reynolds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points made by the Deputy echo those which were made to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Seán Calleary, who visited Kiltyclogher and the surrounding area on Monday 13 May at the request of Leitrim County Council.  The Minister of State had discussions with a wide range of local people including Deputies Ellis and Reynolds and members of the county council.  He visited a number of the closed border crossings to see at first hand the <Col N="1041" /> practical problems faced by local communities as a result of closed border roads, and will be making a report to the Minister when he returns from Brussels.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has argued that the reopening of even one or two of the six closed crossings in the county would be a very welcome development.  He drew particular attention to the situation in the village of Kiltyclogher, which has declined greatly since the local roads into County Fermanagh were closed in the 1970s, and the way in which the closure of the Rossinver-Garrison road is impeding the development of the tourism potential of Lough Melvin and its hinterland.  I have to say that the case for reopening at least one of these roads was well developed by the Deputy and is similar to that made by Leitrim County Council and the various deputations met by the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, yesterday and also on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>The Government are, of course, fully aware of the economic and social disruption caused to the people of Counties Leitrim and Fermanagh by the closure of cross-Border roads, and there is every sympathy for people whose lives have been disrupted by these measures.  The questions of road closures and the particular difficulties they create for people in areas such as Leitrim and Fermanagh have been repeatedly raised with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast.  The issue has also be discussed at meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, including the most recent Conference meeting, which was held in London on 26 April last.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government will continue to press the issue vigorously with the British authorities and to urge, as we have done in the past, that all road closures should be kept under regular and careful review and that they should be maintained only where the most persuasive security considerations exist.</P>

      <P>At present old age pensioners with savings in banks, building <Col N="1042" /> societies and post offices have to pay the DIRT tax on the interest on their savings and then, dependent on their exemption from tax, that is refunded at a later date on completion of the appropriate paperwork.</P>
      <P>At present more than 20,000 claim that refund, the majority of whom are old age pensioners.  In 1990 about £15.3 million was refunded.  It is estimated that thousands of people do not bother to claim the refund because of the bureaucracy involved and also because of their own fears and concerns.</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom, where a similar situation prevails, deposit interest retention tax is not automatically withheld from the accounts of senior citizens or people on such low incomes that they pay no income tax.  Here both groups are treated in the same way as any other earning income depositor.  Many old age pensioners are often afraid to invest even a small amount of money in any savings institutions.  Many of them would prefer to keep their money in a biscuit tin or under the mattress, with the attendant risk of burglary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deposit interest retention tax was introduced in 1986.  It operates as a deduction at source, at the standard rate of income tax, from deposit interest paid by banks, building societies, etc.  The standard rate of income tax was 35 per cent when the tax was introduced. It has since, of course, been reduced to 29 per cent.  The Finance Act, 1986, provides that retention tax may be repaid to persons aged 65 years or over to the extent that they would not otherwise be liable to tax on the relevant deposit interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have introduced a series of measures to ensure that refunds of retention tax are made to the elderly as quickly as possible.  First, a special simplified system was introduced in respect of such refunds in 1986. Secondly, the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1043" /> conducted an advertising campaign in the press and on radio in April 1990 in order to draw attention to the circumstances in which an individual is entitled to a refund. The campaign was successful and resulted in an appreciable increase in the number of claims received.  Thirdly, since 1990 the Revenue Commissioners have been maintaining a computerised record of all taxpayers who qualify for a refund of DIRT, so that those taxpayers will be issued automatically with a claim form in order to facilitate the following year's claim.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the procedures for <Col N="1044" /> refunds to the elderly are working satisfactorily and that there is no undue delay in processing claims for refunds.  There are no plans to introduce a system of payment of interest gross, as suggested. I also point out that there are a number of saving options to which retention tax does not apply.  These include interest from credit unions and interest and bonus from the three small-savers' schemes operated by An Post, savings bonds, savings certificates and national instalment savings.  By switching to one or a combination of these, it is possible to minimise the impact of retention tax on interest income.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 May 1991.</P>

      <P>The chairman of CIE has advised me that every mile of track on the railway network is inspected by Iarnrod Éireann personnel at least twice weekly.  This inspection includes an examination of accommodation level crossing gates and of railway and other fencing for any deficiencies likely to lead to animal incursion. Any defects found on inspection are reported and arrangements are made for their immediate repair.  Maintenance personnel are located strategically throughout the railway network for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Following a derailment near Claremorris in September 1989, which resulted from a collision between a passenger train and a herd of cattle, Iarnrod Éireann established an internal inquiry to ascertain the cause of this accident and also to examine in detail the possibilities of eliminating or reducing hazards in the operation of accommodation level crossings. I have been informed by the chairman of CIE that Iarnrod Éireann are in the process of implementing the recommendations contained in the report of the internal inquiry.  I understand that Iarnrod Éireann are maintaining regular contact with the farming bodies, both in private and through public meetings, to achieve a greater awareness of safety at railway level crossings.</P>

      <P>The question of the telephone codes used to access various parts of the telephone network is an operational matter for Telecom Éireann and is one in which it would not be appropriate for me to intervene. However, the recent announcement by Telecom Éireann of the expansion of the local call areas will give increased local call coverage to 75 per cent of customers outside the 01 area.  This applies also to customers in County Galway and so the fact of different codes in an area will not be so important from the point of view of charging for calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the Ballinasloe area, which covers the Loughrea, Athlone and Banagher areas at present will be extended to cover Portumna, Tuam, Roscommon and Castlerea areas.  At present the Ballinasloe area gives local <Col N="779" /> call access to 16,000 lines and this will be extended to 29,000 when the expansion announced by Telecom Éireann takes effect.</P>
    <P>As another example, I would quote the Castlerea area which has local access to over 11,000 other customers.  In January next this area will be expanded to the Ballinasloe and Tuam areas to the south/south-west as well as Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon to the north.  This will increase local access to over 26,000 numbers.</P>
    <P>While this may not completely satisfy the needs of all subscribers in County Galway the Deputy will appreciate that it is a change for the better.</P>

      <P>Government policy on the level of air fares to and from Ireland is that they should be at least as competitive as those for countries with whom we compete in international markets.  Both Aer Lingus and Ryanair accept this policy and act accordingly in setting fare levels.  In this connection, the Deputy should note that I have recently approved a reduction in <Col N="782" /> Aer Lingus fares on European routes, including Germany and Switzerland, which match the reductions to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>My Department constantly monitor European fares charged by our airlines to ensure Government policy is adhered to.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are literally hundreds of fares for routes in and out of Ireland and corresponding numbers for other European routes.  I have had compiled a sample list of air fares from London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt to Dublin and a number of other major points in Europe.  The fares chosen for comparison are the executive class and the cheapest promotional fare available on the particular route.  The comparisons are made on a rate per mile basis which not only reflect airline costs and efficiency but also factors such as route charges, landing charges, fuel efficiency, load factors, passenger mixes etc.</P>
      <P>It will be seen from this table, which I propose to circulate in the Official Report, that air fares to Ireland from these points compare favourably with fares to other destinations.</P>

      <P>I raised the question of illegal fishing activities by non-EC boats in Community waters at the EC Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 18 April last.  There was general support within the Council on the need to address this problem.  It was agreed that the Commission, in consultation with the member states most affected, would examine this matter with a view to putting a mechanism in place to curb such illegal activity.</P>
      <P>In this regard the Commission subsequently arranged a meeting with the relevant member states, including Ireland, at which arrangements were made for closer co-operation and the fast transfer of relevant information between member states affected.</P>
      <P>I will continue to keep this matter under close review to ensure that all necessary steps are taken both by our fishery protection service and other Community countries to deal with this illegal activity.</P>

Arramara have 25 employees, a turnover of about £1.5 million per annum and a solid track record in the exploitation of the seaweed resources in Counties Donegal and Galway in the interests of local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department operate in close liaison with Arramara and I have encouraged the company in relation to the greater use of existing resources and <Col N="787" /> diversification.  The bulk of Arramara's output is, in fact, exported.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department encourage and support enterprise and research in this sector, by means of, for example, advice and guidance and issue of foreshore licences, where relevant.  My Department have also been in touch with the IDA concerning development of this sector.</P>

      <P>Marine research is an issue to which I attach considerable priority.  As an indication of my commitment in this area, the Marine Institute Act, 1991, is now on the Statute Book and my Department are working on the detail to allow for the early establishment of the institute.  The institute will provide a mechanism for the coherent application and co-ordination of the State's efforts in this sector.</P>
      <P>Marine research within my Department is at present undertaken by the Fisheries Research Centre and it is concentrated on fish stock assessment, aquaculture, the marine environment and fish pathology.  Research is geared to the support of economic development and the protection of the marine environment. The establishment of the Marine Institute will facilitate the enhancement of present efforts and in that context will draw on resources available in the south-west.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to a question from him dated 21 March 1991 about the shellfish industry and a research centre in the south-west.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my written reply of 20 March to his question on the environmental damage in Kuwait, I believe that Ireland can assist most effectively with the alleviation of the very serious consequences for the environment in the Gulf area as part of the co-ordinated action by the European Community.   Following a meeting between Community Environment Ministers and the Minister for Health of Bahrain in Brussels on 18 March, the Environment Council asked the Commission to pursue existing initiatives and to undertake new ones aimed at increasing Community support for the authorities in the region with responsibility for cleaning up the oil spillage.  It also asked the Commission to examine the possibility of co-ordinating any possible <Col N="789" /> assistance which the European oil industry could contribute in dealing with the burning oil wells.  As a result of this request, the Community subsequently decided to allocate up to 15 million ECU to finance various environmental actions in the Gulf.</P>
      <P>A significant contribution to the work of cleaning up the oil spillage in the Gulf is also made by the Community's Pollution Task Force.  Meetings of the task force are held regularly in Brussels to plan and administer assistance from the Community.</P>
      <P>The Community continues to monitor the situation regarding the damage to the environment in the Gulf, in close liaison with the countries in the region and the other international agencies involved.  It is, however, too early to quantify precisely at this stage the damage to the environment which will arise in the Gulf as much of the necessary action required to remedy the damage done, including the extinguishing of the fires in the oil wells, will need to continue for quite some time.</P>

      <P>The Iraqi authorities brutally repressed the uprising which followed the Gulf War in both Southern and Northern Iraq, causing many of the inhabitants to flee the country.  The population of Southern Iraq is largely Shi'ite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resolution 688 adopted by the UN Security Council on 5 April 1991 condemned the repression of the Iraqi civilian population in many parts of Iraq, demanded that Iraq immediately end this repression and expressed the hope that an open dialogue would take place to ensure that the human and political rights <Col N="790" /> of all Iraqi citizens are respected.  It also insisted that Iraq allow immediate access by international humanitarian organisations to all those in need of assistance in all parts of Iraq and make available all necessary facilities for their operations.</P>
    <P>We joined with our Community partners in early April in condemning Iraq's brutal repression of both Kurds and Shi'ites.  This statement again reminded Iraq that only the path of dialogue with all the parties concerned will allow the shaping of a renewed Iraq, united and respectful of the legitimate aspirations of the population groups of which the country is made up.  We will continue to press for this.</P>
    <P>I have placed copies of the Security Council Resolution and of the Statement by the Community and its member states in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>As to humanitarian aid I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question from Deputy O'Keeffe on 23 April in which I provided details of the official aid given by the Government to relieve the plight of Iraqi refugees.  To date Ireland has contributed £1.235 million most of which has gone to Iraqi refugees in Iran, who, of course, include Shi'ites as well as Kurds.</P>

      <i>Notes&mdash;General</i>
    </P>
    <P>The values set out in the table are obtained by increasing the amount of the allowances in question from their level in the income tax year 1970-71 (or later, depending on the date of introduction) by reference to the increase in the consumer price index over the period between midMay 1970 (or later, depending on the date of introduction) and mid-February 1991 (the latest figure available).</P>
    <P> * The general child tax allowance, which then stood at £100, was abolished with effect from 6 April 1986.  The revenue from its abolition was used, along with other moneys, to fund the introduction of child benefit at a rate sufficient to compensate standard rate taxpayers, then paying tax at 35 per cent, for its loss.  In 1989 a child addition of £200 per child was introduced in conjunction with the income tax exemption limits; in 1990 this was increased to £300 per child, and in 1991 to £500 for third and subsequent children. </P>

      <P>Maintenance and development works will both continue on the Royal Canal during 1991 and for future years as resources become available.  The emphasis this year will be on restoring navigation through the city of Dublin. This, when achieved, will link the River Liffey with Mullingar.  A programme of lockgate manufacture for locks between Mullingar and the Shannon is under way.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the Kilbeggan branch will be restored and reopened to navigation.  It is not possible, however, to indicate when the necessary resources might be made available.  I am well aware of the good work being done in Kilbeggan by the local development association and I am advised that the Commissioners of Public Works have provided some assistance to the group.</P>

      <P>In discussions with members of the national level team established to act on behalf of the Central Review Committee to organise the project, statutory, community and business interests in Cork have suggested that the areas to be earmarked should initially concentrate on the Gurranabraher, Knocknaheeny, Blackpool and Mayfield areas.</P>

In that context, community interests have nominated five persons from the four areas referred to and a representative from Cork Community Development Institute to be their six nominees to the board of the interim company.  The local interests have requested that FÁS, CERT, City of Cork VEC, Cork Corporation, the Department of Social Welfare and the IDA be represented on the board, and that the Southern Health Board be represented at meetings, and this is being arranged.

      <P>It was determined by an appeals officer on 23 January 1991 that the persons concerned were not entitled to pension. The appeals officer held that the relinquishing of director's fees by one of <Col N="809" /> the persons concerned and the subsequent transfer of their shareholding in a registered company was done by them in order to qualify for old age pension.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, provides that a person who deprives himself of income or property in order to qualify for old age non-contributory pension continues to be assessed with the means in question for the purposes of determining entitlement to pension.</P>
      <P>The decision of the appeals officer is final and conclusive except where facts or evidence not previously brought to light are disclosed.  My Department have not been made aware of any new facts or evidence since the appeal hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 21 March 1989 to 10 July 1990 when payment of benefit was disallowed following an examination on 27 June 1990 by a medical referee who found him capable of work.  He appealed this decision and was examined again on 18 September 1990 by a different medical referee who also found him capable of work.  He pursued his appeal and the case was referred to an appeals officer.  An oral hearing of this appeal was held on 28 November 1990 and the appeals officer decided that he was capable of work from 11 July 1990.  Following representations for a review and in the light of the medical evidence available, the chief appeals <Col N="812" /> officer sought a specialist medical report. To this end, an appointment was made by the medical adviser of my Department with a consultant in Cork to have the person concerned examined on 22 March 1991.  However, the consultant had to cancel the appointment and sent a message to the FAX number in one of my Department's buildings.  This was not the building in which these cases are processed and the message was apparently mislaid in transit to the proper building. Steps have been taken to prevent this type of occurrence again.  My officials are not, therefore, disputing that the message was received.</P>
    <P>A further complication in this case was that the chief medical adviser, who has since retired, has made a memorandum to the effect that he was initially told, during the course of a telephone conversation with the consultant's office, that no notification had been sent.</P>
    <P>My officials and I regret the inconvenience experienced by the person concerned. It is also regretted that, as a result of the circumstances as outlined, the case was not resolved earlier and complete information furnished to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Following a further oral hearing of his case on 8 May 1991, an appeals officer decided that the person in question was not capable of work.  Payment of disability benefit has been restored at the weekly rate of £64.90 from 7 May 1991. He had been in receipt of unemployment benefit, including pay-related benefit, up to 6 May pending the outcome of his appeal.</P>
    <P>The person concerned also appealed against a review decision by the deciding officer who had allowed disablement benefit at the rate appropriate to an assessment of 10 per cent from 20 July 1990. The appeals officer decided that disablement benefit should be increased from that date to the rate appropriate to an assessment of 15 per cent.  That decision has since been reviewed in the light of recent medical evidence received and the rate of disablement benefit is now based on an assessment of 25 per cent disablement from 20 July 1990 to 31 December 1991.  An adjusting payment <Col N="813" /> in respect of this latest decision will be made to him shortly.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the medical care of the offender in question is a matter for the medical officer at Mountjoy Prison and that it would not be appropriate to disclose details of the medical treatment being prescribed in any individual case.  The offender also has available to her within the prison a wide range of other services including psychiatric, psychological, welfare and chaplaincy to help her cope with any difficulties posed by her imprisonment and her eventual release.  The nature of the treatment/counselling provided for each offender is determined on appropriate professional advice.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was committed to Mountjoy female prison under section 102 (3) of the Children Act, 1908 having been certified by the court as being of so unruly a character that she could not be detained in a place of detention provided for under the 1908 Act.</P>
      <P>Offenders in this category are housed separately from adult offenders in Mountjoy female prison in accordance with the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947 as interpreted by the courts.  They are held in dormitory-type accommodation with integral sanitation and they have access to a full range of medical, psychiatric, psychological, welfare, educational, work training and chaplaincy services.  The number of such offenders varies from time to time and, at present, the offender in question is the only one coming within this category who is in custody.  This means that she lacks the company of a like offender for the present but it does not mean that she is being held in solitary confinement despite other accommodation options being legally available, as the question implies. Indeed, the present arrangements for her accommodation are in accordance with a recent decision of the High Court given on foot of an application brought on her behalf.</P>

      <P>Proposals to reduce the amount of time spent in court, particularly in relation to minor offences, are the subject of on-going review by the Garda authorities and by my Department and a number of measures has been taken.  For example, over the past number of years considerable progress has been made on computerised scheduling of court cases so that cases being dealt with by a particular garda are listed together for hearing so far as possible.</P>
      <P>I might mention in particular the use of the summons procedure, whereby persons arrested for certain minor offences may, where it is practical to do so, be released and proceeded against by way of summons, instead of being charged and brought before the next sitting of the district court.  This procedure is intended to reduce the amount of Garda time spent in court on adjournments.</P>
      <P>The most recent measure taken is the introduction by the Garda authorities in December 1990 of a pilot vehicle rectification scheme in the DMA, which enables motorists to repair vehicle faults within a specified period as an alternative to prosecution and thereby reduces the amount of Garda attendance in court in such cases.</P>

The by-laws also prohibit the deposit of a skip on a clearway or a footpath adjoining a clearway during clearway hours.</P>

      <P>I propose to circulate, in the Official Report, a tabular statement setting out, for the years 1989 to 1991 inclusive, the block grants allocated specifically for the maintenance of regional and county roads and the amounts per kilometre which the grants represent in each case.  During this period, county councils were also allocated block grants for the improvement of regional and county roads, supplementary discretionary grants for the improvement of these roads and discretionary grants in respect of damage to these roads due to severe weather.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1989, grants were not allocated specifically for the maintenance of regional and county roads.  The system of grants then in operation involved the allocation of a single block grant, to each County Council, which supplemented the local authority's own resources for the improvement and maintenance of regional roads and for the improvement of county roads.  The grants could not be applied to the maintenance of county roads.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 175 of 23 April 1991.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the revision of speed limits in County Wexford is as set out in the reply to Question No. 172 of 7 May last.</P>
      <P>Under existing law, speed limits must be prescribed in regulations made by me under the Road Traffic Acts.  A measure of devolution has existed since 1974 whereby such regulations are made on a county by county basis, following periodic reviews undertaken by local authorities in conjunction with the Garda.  It is my policy to implement local authority proposals as far as possible subject only to discretion being exercised by me in relation to proposals for limits on national roads in view of the importance of ensuring uniformity of treatment for the national road network as a whole.</P>
      <P>The question of devolving full responsibility for setting speed limits, other than on national routes, will be considered in the context of a general review of road traffic legislation and in the implementation of the local government reform programme.</P>

      <P>The number of recorded sudden infant deaths in children aged under 12 months during the year 1 October 1989 to 30 September 1990 was 104.  However this figure relates to the number of deaths registered in that period with the Central Statistics Office rather than necessarily the number of deaths that occurred during that time.</P>
      <P>The latest year for which information on the year of occurrence is available is 1987; there were 112 sudden infant deaths during that year.</P>
      <P>I have been anxious to promote research into the incidence and causes of sudden infant death in Ireland.  To this end I recently allocated funds from the national lottery to the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association for the establishment of a register of these deaths.  The register will form an important data base for a three-year research project to be carried out by medical personnel in the association. A grant of £24,500 will be paid this year, with grants of £23,000 in both 1992 and 1993.</P>
      <P>In 1989 and 1990, the Health Research Board funded research at the Rotunda Hospital into the pathology of the placenta associated with sudden infant death syndrome.  Grants totalling £35,000 were given by the board.</P>

      <P>The health promotion unit of the Department of Health support the activities of the Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital (AWCH), which offer help and advice to parents whose child needs to be admitted to hospital.  To correspond with the association's National Awareness Week (22-26 April 1991), the unit published a leaflet and poster which had been developed by AWCH.  These materials highlight the activities of the association and give contact names and addresses around the country for further help and information.</P>
      <P>The leaflet suggests ways of overcoming the fear and anxiety associated with a visit to hospital.  It encourages parents to talk about hospital as a cheerful place with their children, before admission, and to visit often afterwards, offering support and reassurance, all the time.</P>
      <P>Copies of the leaflet and poster have been circulated to all health board offices for dissemination.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthopaedic services in <Col N="842" /> the counties mentioned is the responsibility of the Midland Health Board in the first instance.  At present, the average waiting time for hip replacement operations is six to seven months in the Midland Health Board area.  Urgent cases are admitted much sooner &mdash; usually within one or two months.  This compares reasonably well with waiting times for hip replacement operations nationally.  In addition, Cappagh Hospital performed 30 hip replacement operations for patients from the Midland Health Board area in 1990.</P>
      <P>My Department is considering a recent application from the Midland Health Board to appoint an additional orthopaedic surgeon at Tullamore General Hospital.

      <P>Arising out of concern about possible health consequences from the levels of radiation in the Irish Sea region, a study was commissioned by the Department of Health into the mortality and incidence of childhood leukaemia in this country. The study was published in December 1986.  The study found that the annual incidence rate for acute lymphoid leukaemia in children in this country was within the range of rates found in children in other western populations.  No clustering of deaths was seen in any area along the east coast and overall mortality in the 21-mile deep east and south-east coastal strips was similar to the national average.</P>

      <P>I understand from the health boards that a comprehensive range of family planning services is available in each board area. These services are provided by general practitioners, pharmacists and voluntary organisations and there are licensed family planning clinics in some areas. Comprehensive information and advice in relation to family planning is also readily available through other professional personnel in both hospital and community settings.</P>

    <P>The opening of the new Cavan General Hospital in 1989 marked a substantial upgrading of acute hospital services for <Col N="847" /> the area.  I would remind the Deputy of the considerable investment made in the project.  Building costs came to £26 million and, in addition, £2.5 million was provided for equipment.  The Deputy will also be pleased to learn that the new hospital has been given significantly increased staffing levels and consultant cover over the former surgical hospital and Lisdarn Hospital which it replaced. I think the Deputy will agree that the magnitude of this investment, at a time of economic constraints, is adequate testimony of the Government's commitment to the improvement of hospital services in Cavan.</P>
    <P>With regard to Monaghan Hospital, there has been general agreement for some time that the improvement of outpatient services at that hospital is essential. Presumably the Deputy has no objection to this very necessary work being carried out and that it is not his intention to deny the people of Monaghan this basic facility.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that patients are removed from their beds at Cavan General Hospital to make way for accident cases.  The North-Eastern Health Board has confirmed that this has never been the case.  The only time patients may be relocated is when it is in their best interest, having regard to the nature of the medical and nursing care they require.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am not aware of `grave public disquiet' in relation to the operation of the hospital.  In fact, the opposite would appear the case.  The increased workload would indicate a high public acceptance of the service being provided, public confidence in the staff and public satisfaction with the new facilities.</P>

      <P>It was suggested at the press conference called by Cheeverstown House on Friday, 3 May, that neither my Department nor the Eastern Health Board have funds to open additional places in Cheeverstown.  This is not the case.  Last year, the Government made a special allocation of £2 million available to provide additional places for persons with mental handicap.  Of this sum, £1 million was spent in the Eastern Health Board area, providing an additional 91 residential and 250 day places, almost all of which were in voluntary agencies. Because of the difficulties between Cheeverstown House and the Eastern Health Board, it was not possible to assign any of these additional funds to Cheeverstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, the Government have made an additional allocation of £1 million <Col N="855" /> available to provide more places for persons with mental handicap.  Most of the funding will be spent in the Eastern Health Board area.  It was my intention that a significant proportion of this sum would be available to Cheeverstown House in the current year on the basis of the agreement negotiated between Cheeverstown House and the Eastern Health Board last October.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 8 May, I wrote to the chairman and members of the board of Cheeverstown House advising them that additional funds were available to open more places in Cheeverstown this year provided the board agreed to abide by the terms of the agreement with the Eastern Health Board negotiated through the good offices of the Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with Mental Handicap.  I have not yet received a response to that letter.</P>
    <P>I understand that the initiative undertaken by the federation referred to above to resolve the difficulties between the centre and the Eastern Health Board has come to an end.  The federation will be reporting to me this week on the outcome of their initiative.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is advising me on possible options to ensure that the facilities at Cheeverstown House, which were provided at public expense, will be put at the disposal of persons with mental handicap at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>In 1990 42,000 adults received routine treatment.  This included 25,000 persons who benefited from the additional budget allocation provided by the Government. It is expected that the same level of treatment will be provided in the current year. The number of adults who received dentures during 1990 is not available.  The waiting lists are currently being reviewed and when this information is available I will communicate with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most health boards, routine dental services for children are now organised on a school based system whereby all <Col N="857" /> children in specified classes are screened each year and treated where necessary and therefore waiting lists are no longer relevant.</P>
    <P>The numbers of children receiving orthodontic treatment in the various health board areas during 1990 were as follows:</P>

      <P>My Department's personnel policy provides health agencies with flexibility to target staffing resources to areas of particular priority within the context of an overall approved staffing ceiling and annual financial parameters.  This policy facilitates the targeting of staffing resources between different centres in accordance with the priorities of the relevant health board.</P>

      <P>All health agencies have experienced great difficulty in recruiting speech therapists over the last number of years.  My Department are currently examining these difficulties and the number of training places is being examined with the educational authorities.</P>
      <P>However, the Eastern Health Board have recently recruited nine new speech therapists and a senior therapist for adult mental handicap commenced duty on 1 May 1991.  St. Michael's House have recently advertised for speech therapists and will hold interviews on 10 June 1991.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board in relation to the case referred to by the Deputy.  The speech therapy services to the school have improved over the last number of weeks and a speech therapist is now attending five hours per week.  While it is not possible to give an exact commencement date for speech therapy for this child, he remains on the waiting list and will be accommodated as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's estimate of the number of children in the Limerick city catchment area who will be seeking post-primary school places in coming years is as follows: 1991, 1,877; 1992, 1,817; 1993, 1,852; 1994, 1,743; 1995, 1,728; 1996, 1,452; <Col N="862" /> 1997, 1,732; 1998, 1,730.  It is not feasible, at this stage, to quantify accurately the demand for places beyond 1998. However, in view of the decline in births in Limerick city of 46 per cent in the period 1980 to 1989 the numbers seeking post-primary places will decline significantly in the longer term.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a centralised scheme for admission to post-primary schools in September 1991 has been introduced by the school authorities in Limerick city. Enrolment policy, generally, is a matter for school managements to decide upon. It would be expected, however, that priority would be given to pupils from within a schools's catchment area.</P>
    <P>While I understand that maintenance of the principle of parental choice is a prime object of the centralised scheme, it must be accepted that, in a catchment area such as Limerick city, where there are a number of post-primary schools, not every pupil will obtain a place in his/her first choice school.  My Department's overall responsibility is to ensure that all the schools have, between them, adequate provision to meet demand and I am satisfied that this applies in Limerick city.</P>

      <P>There are two post-primary schools in the Rathkeale catchment area, viz. the Mercy secondary school and the vocational school.</P>

    <P>It is inevitable, given geographical and other considerations, that children from one post-primary catchment area will seek to attend schools in adjacent catchment areas.  The question of whether such <Col N="866" /> children should be accepted for enrolment in schools outside their catchment area is a matter for school managements to decide upon, subject to the availability of accommodation.  Enrolment trends in primary and post-primary schools generally are kept under regular review in my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 185 and 192 together.  As the Deputy will be aware the staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment on 30 school on the 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with the agreement between the Government and INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment on the 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of St. Brigid's primary school, The Coombe, where numbers of pupils on rolls have been declining, there were 314 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1990, which warrants a staff of principal plus nine assistants for the 1991-92 school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school will also have the services of a full-time remedial teacher and a concessionary teacher under the special <Col N="867" /> scheme of teaching assistance for schools serving disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. I am not aware that either of these conditions pertain in this school at present.</P>

      <P>One of the major reasons I rejected Telecom's original proposals was my concern that the disadvantaged might be adversely affected by the proposed changes.</P>
      <P>I am mindful of the problem referred to by the Deputy and I have ensured that an overall reduction of 8 per cent has taken place in the national telephone bill. This means that £48 million in savings will be passed on to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that local calls will be charged at 1 unit per 15 minute interval for weekday peak times and that less than 3 per cent of calls will be affected.  All other local calls, including weekends and public holidays will be charged at 1 unit per 30 minute interval with less than 2 <Col N="878" /> per cent of calls being affected.  When considered against the reduction in trunk call charges and the expansion of the local call areas the vast majority of subscribers should experience a significant reduction in bills.</P>

      <Col N="879" /> Charges for MMDS services are primarily a matter for MMDS operators. It is likely that MMDS operators will offer a range of services including the four UK terrestrial television channels and some satellite channels as a basic service.  However, I understand that the capital costs associated with the introduction of MMDS are such that the level of charge suggested by the Deputy would not be economically viable.</P>
