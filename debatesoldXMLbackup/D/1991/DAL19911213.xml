      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 12 and 15.</P>

      <P>There is nothing to put to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am sure the House will unanimously condemn the terrible atrocity perpetrated in Craigavon last night in which so many people were injured.  Will the Taoiseach convey the condemnation of this House to all concerned?  Second, may I ask the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to rule on a matter of that kind but it is not one for the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, a Cheann Comhairle.  I think the House would be unanimous in expressing relief that there were no fatalities last night but regret the great number of injuries.  Will the Taoiseach say if it is the intention of the Government to circulate the housing Bill before Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I informed the House yesterday that it is hoped to take <Col N="1546" /> it early in the next session.  The idea would be to circulate it during the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Not before Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions to put to the Taoiseach.  First, in relation to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill there is consensus in the House that that Bill needs to be passed urgently. May I suggest to the Taoiseach that he consider referring Committee Stage of that Bill to a Special Committee early in the next session?  Second, will the Taoiseach now confirm that it will not be possible to have the Estimates circulated in time to have a debate on them before the Christmas recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is being very alarmist this morning.  It is the Government's firm intention to have the Book of Estimates published and discussed here on Wednesday and Thursday of next week.  That is the standard practice of this Government, in glaring contradiction to the appalling practice of the last Fine Gael/Labour Coalition when we were lucky if we got the Book of Estimates on budget day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say on what day the Book of Estimates will be available to the Opposition spokes-persons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy put another question to me?  That is one of the difficulties the Opposition are getting themselves into these days &mdash; they are so anxious to launch allegations by way of questions that they forget the questions they asked.  Deputy Dowling did ask a question, or I should say, Deputy Howlin &mdash; I should know that name because it is a very honoured Wexford name; there are some very good Fianna Fáil people of that name.</P>

      <P>As the matter has been clarified today, and as I have now no further time to ask a question of the Taoiseach before the end of the year, I understood the specific undertaking was that the Government, by the end of the year, would have considered a report on the matter.  As the Taoiseach has invited me to ask a question would he say whether the Government have received the report and considered it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two points.  While I agree with Deputy Howlin about the urgency of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and the need to take Committee Stage as soon as possible, I am disappointed that the Taoiseach is inclined to agree with Deputy Howlin's suggestion that the Bill should be dealt with in Special Committee. If this Bill goes into Special Committee there is no way I can be represented on that committee.  That represents a very serious negation of democracy and I would ask the Taoiseach not to send the Bill into Special Committee.</P>
      <P>It appears that we ordered today's business yesterday but that it has now been completely changed.  Will the Taoiseach say what arrangements are made for Vote 33, which we did not agree yesterday to take?</P>

    <P>It is with reluctance that I move this motion.  As the House knows, 1991 was the year for the elections to the regional boards.  Such elections are held every five years.  The elections were linked into the Fisheries Act, 1991.  I was anxious early in the summer to see to it that the Fisheries Act was on the Statute Book and I accepted a minor amendment in Seanad Éireann allowing life members of the former Inland Fisheries Trust to have voting rights in these elections.  I was urged in this House by Deputy Gilmore and one or two others to do this, as well as by some Senators.  However, I did not get any co-operation when I brought this back to the House and tried to have it through before the summer recess.  I regret that very much, but I do not want to make heavy weather of it.  The regional <Col N="1555" /> board elections and elections of the management committees of the new co-ops are to take place at the same time.  The angling organisations and the fisheries boards contacted me and requested that I should bring this order before the House. That is what I am doing, and for the purpose stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another episode in this ongoing tale.  I hope that the fish in our lakes and rivers will have as lively and long a run as this legislation.  There was a controversial and in-depth debate in both Houses and further deliberation took place outside this House with regard to the constitutional question which hung over it.  Members on this side would argue that we were carrying out our legislative and constitutional duties in ensuring that as far as possible this legislation would be effective.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister, I do not wish to delay the House.  I should like to think that the other provisions will be put in place as quickly as possible.  However, it will take time to set up some of the structures proposed as they are new and outside the range of structures with which the fishing industry is familiar.  The regional fisheries boards will have a year to prepare for the elections.  This is much more time than we get to prepare for general elections.  I should like to think that these elections will be skilfully and democratically carried out.  Finally, I should like to ask the Minister whether the present nominees on the regional fisheries boards will remain in office and whether the present structures will continue to operate without interruption until such time as the elections take place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the postponement of the elections.  In fact, the last time we debated this matter I requested the Minister to postpone the elections.  The Minister said that he did not receive any co-operation in his effort to get the legislation on the Statute Book. I have to say that there were very good reasons for this.  One must remember that <Col N="1556" /> the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1987, which will be four years in operation on 16 December, gave rise to the problems in the first instance.  I objected to that Act for the simple reason that regulations had not been circulated and we did not know what the rules of the co-operative societies would be.  Many angling interests had indicated that they wanted the elections to be held on a five year basis as they would not be ready after four years.  At present angling groups are debating the regulations in regard to the co-operative movement. I have no qualms about not having co-operated in the debate on the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1987. Nevertheless I wish to acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister in the intervening period to try to solve this ongoing dispute.</P>
      <P>The motion before us this morning is, so to speak, a simple technical adjustment. The need for this arises from the fact that we rushed legislation through this House which caused one of the bitterest disputes this country has seen for a long time.  I want to stress that this is the reason I was not co-operative.  I think the Minister said Deputies had been obstructive.  I can assure him that I was not obstructive.  I have acknowledged the efforts he has made over a long period to try to resolve this dispute.  However, it must be remembered that the Government created the problem in the first instance.  Hopefully, this long running dispute will be resolved on the fifth anniversary of the Act next year and that new legislation will be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat that I have been as helpful as possible under the circumstances. The Labour Party objected to the legislation four years ago as we believed it was ill advised and would not work.  As can be seen, it did not work, caused much bitterness and led to a loss of revenue for the country.  I am glad the Minister has responded positively to the request by the angling interests, the regional fisheries boards and politicians to postpone the elections until next year. I want to repeat that I acknowledge the efforts the Minister has made to try to <Col N="1557" /> resolve this long running dispute.  Hopefully, the issue will be put to rest once and for all in December 1992.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Marine is a remarkable man in some respects.  One would think a Minister for the Marine who has had the run of luck, or perhaps one should say bad luck, this Minister has had with regard to this issue would have picked a day other than Friday the thirteenth to come into the House to ask us to agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to a further proposal in this long running and tortuous saga.  The Minister's ingenuity is matched only by his courage.  He suggested that one of the reasons we are here today is because of the lack of co-operation by this side of the House in regard to his earlier efforts.  I am not sure what the Minister is specifically referring to.  If he is referring to the effort by the Government Whip of the day in the last week before the summer recess to push the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991, which he described as a simple amendment, into an already packed schedule of business, I do not think he can visit criticism on the Opposition simply because we requested the opportunity to have a say in the matter and asked that it be taken in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government never seem to move expeditiously on matters until the last two weeks of the session when we are made sit late hours to push through legislation, which is guillotined, and motions at an incredible speed.  That is what happened in July last.  If the Minister is referring to the history of the legislation before that, it must be remembered that in the last week before the Christmas recess, when people were perhaps taken up with more festive matters, the legislation which gave rise to all the problems went through this House virtually on the nod.  To their credit, the angling community and the broader community <Col N="1558" /> reacted vehemently to that bad legislation. We have sought since then to put the matter right.  The initial mistake was made by the Government, who introduced poor legislation without proper consultation or regard for the people involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the motion before the House, the Minister acknowledged that he was responding in part to Deputy Gilmore's proposition in regard to life members of the regional fisheries boards when he introduced the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991, in the Seanad. While we thank him for that we would much prefer if he had listened more to what Deputy Gilmore said about the fundamental issue of the legislation, that is, the establishment of these co-operatives is as equally ill advised as the original legislation.  They represent no more than the reintroduction of the rod licence by another device and are a money saving exercise by and large.  It is for this reason that The Workers' Party opposed the legislation in its first and second forms and are opposed to the concept of these co-operatives.  There would be no need for this motion if the Minister had accepted the advice offered by Deputy Gilmore and had not established these co-operatives in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister when he is replying to the debate to confirm that the Government are having difficulties in regard to the holding of these elections, that some of the regional fisheries boards &mdash; in particular, the Eastern and Western Regional Fisheries Boards &mdash; are refusing to nominate personnel to the proposed co-operatives and that the Government are now facing a revolt at a different level in regard to this legislation.</P>
    <P>In those few remarks I tried to acknowledge the bravery and the non-superstition of the Tánaiste in moving the motion on this auspicious day.  While there is reluctance on his part there is regret on the part of The Workers' Party that we have had to reach this stage.  Had the position been taken as advanced by <Col N="1559" /> Deputy Gilmore we would not be debating this motion today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I will not be opposing this motion.  I hope it brings to a conclusion an inglorious saga of bungling, ineptitude, intimidation and so forth which has damaged our tourist trade and divided local communities.  I hope we have seen the last of it.  As I think all the Deputies on this side of the House agreed, this is extremely bureaucratic convoluted legislation.  This is just another twist in its tortuous route.  There appears to be a lack of co-operation by the fisheries boards and this is understandable as they had been opposed to the Bill from the start.  We must all be concerned about the impasse concerning the appointment of trustees by the Minister. I would ask him to use his power of appointment with great discretion and not to exacerbate further an already delicate situation.  It must be said that this matter is by no means dead.  Getting legislation through the House is one thing, getting the co-operation of the various interests &mdash; the anglers, the fisheries boards, the co-operatives, Bord Fáilte and so on &mdash; is another matter.  It remains to be seen whether there will be co-operation and I have grave doubts about it.  We have no alternative but to give his order a chance and hope it will work.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my gratitude to Deputy O'Sullivan for acknowledging the efforts, which were severe and time-consuming in trying to resolve the difficulty that arose.  Deputy McCartan said his party wanted to have a say in the matter.  In particular because of an amendment which came from the Seanad and which I accepted there, The Workers' Party did have their say. Indeed, Deputy Gilmore was one of the people who suggested that I do this.  That is the reason I was surprised, considering that the legislation and all the fine print was examined carefully during the course of the debate.  There is no revolt of any kind.  There is exaggerated language about revolts, revolutions and so on.  The co-operation of the regional fisheries boards will be very helpful.</P>
      <P>In regard to the point made by Deputy Garland, Comhaontas Glas, and his concerns about the appointment of trustees, he can be assured that with the advice and assistance I have received all over the country I hope to have a well balanced appointment in the end.</P>

      <P>I am seeking the approval of the House for a token Supplementary Estimate of £1,000 to enable a grant-in-aid of £250,000 to be paid to Dublin Zoo.  This payment will enable the zoo to address the problems arising from its present level of overdraft and the further deficit it will be incurring in the unfavourable months ahead for attendances at the zoo.</P>
      <P>Arising from the report of the committee set up by Government to examine the future operation of the zoo certain proposals are at present before the Government and I would expect to be in a position to announce the outcome of the Government's deliberations in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Zoo plays an important role in <Col N="1562" /> the social and cultural life of this city and in the country as a whole.  There would, I feel, be a high level of interest in the country in seeing the problems of the zoo resolved and to have it operating on a satisfactory financial basis once more.  In the meantime the payment of the £250,000 to the zoo, for which I am now seeking approval, is necessary to enable it to cope with its present financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>The provision for the zoo will be offset by savings under subhead B.9 &mdash; Grants for the Provision of Recreational Facilities. The savings have arisen because construction activity on outstanding projects did not progress as was originally anticipated.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that grants will be paid as soon as these projects reach the stages when they become eligible for grant payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very limited time available to me I would like to thank the Minister for introducing this very welcome Supplementary Estimate and I support it.  The zoo has at present overdraft facilities from the bank for £150,000.  This money will be used up in the next two weeks and the bank was unwilling to grant them additional overdraft facilities without this indication of Government support today.  Because of the crisis facing the zoo this Supplementary Estimate is both opportune and welcome. However, it is only a temporary measure. We need a clearcut policy from the Government to ensure the future of our zoo.  This policy should be accompanied by realistic funding in order to ensure that this great national asset is preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government appointed a zoo committee in 1989 under Mr. Mick Doyle which reported to the Minister for Education in July 1990.  I appeal to the Government to accept the recommendations proposed by the zoo committee, including the recommendation to establish a new State company to take over the zoo.  Immediate funding of at least £5 million and extra land in the Phoenix Park should be provided as a matter of urgency.  The zoo has 30 acres <Col N="1563" /> out of roughly 2,000 acres in the Phoenix Park and of that 30 acres ten are covered by water.  The zoo covers only a very small section of the Phoenix Park. Because of the genuine concern of a number of people I would ask the Government to introduce new animal legislation to monitor the welfare of the zoo animals and to deal with the granting or refusal of zoo licences.  We should build a national aquarium in Dublin Zoo and serious consideration should be given to the possibility of a partnership between the Government and private enterprise with regard to the zoo.</P>
    <P>As is well known, Dublin Zoo is one of the oldest zoos in the world, having opened to the public in 1830.  It is generally acknowledged to be one of the most beautiful of national zoos because of its location in extensive parkland and its being landscaped around a central lake.  It also enjoys the great advantage of being conveniently available to a major populated city.  Because of its location in the capital city it is relatively easy for people from all over Ireland to have access to the zoo.  It has been visited by 5,133,723 people over the last ten years and by 886,341 people over the last two years.</P>
    <P>As the national zoo, it has today, and will have over the next fifty years, a role to play that was never envisaged when the zoo was founded in 1830.  From the point of view of education the zoo has major potential.  During a visit to the zoo both adults and children are introduced to exotic and some native species which they can easily view and associate with.</P>
    <P>The education officer at Dublin Zoo has developed an education programme which is targeted at school children, particularly primary school children, but which also covers secondary schools and third level institutions and of course all the visitors to the zoo.  This education programme is aimed at stimulating an interest in the animal kingdom and in global conservation issues and at disseminating information which will make the visitor more conscious of the threat that all animals are under if the rate of <Col N="1564" /> destruction of habitat all over the world continues at its present rate.</P>
    <P>With regard to conservation, the rate of habitat destruction is so great that it is estimated that one-third of all known species &mdash; plant and animals &mdash; will be extinct by the end of the century.</P>
    <P>Conservation is about safeguarding as far as possible the continuity of the genetic diversity of all species.  No assurances can be given on the survival of many species as their habitat is under threat. Many species are doing extremely badly in the wild even though they are protected internationally and have special reserves set aside for them in their natural habitat.</P>
    <P>The number of animals that are in danger of becoming extinct increases every year.  There is an international scientific community supported by Governments in Europe, North America and many other parts of the world which has developed a sophisticated framework for the protection of species on a global basis.  Dublin Zoo at present plays a role in this and we have many animals from zoos all over the world in Dublin on breeding loan &mdash; for example gorillas, orangutans, white rhinoceros, snow leopards and so on.  Dublin Zoo also has many animals abroad on breeding loan.</P>
    <P>The existence of this framework is a measure of the experience of the scientific zoo community on the inadequacies of relying on the survival of species in the wild and on the advantage, from a conservation point of view, of having a body of knowledge on husbandry of the endangered species worldwide to ensure their chance of long term survival.</P>
    <P>The zoo is also a major tourist attraction and a recreation and general amenity attraction.  Dublin Zoo at present is looked on by many people as an old zoo, where transition and improvement is necessary and desirable, but it requires investment and resources which Dublin Zoo cannot generate by its own efforts. Most zoos in Europe and North America are supported by public funds and this has resulted in better facilities in their zoos.  Belfast Zoo, for example, gets an annual maintenance grant of £500,000 <Col N="1565" /> together with all its capital costs and tens of millions of pounds have been spent developing the Belfast Zoo in recent years.</P>

      <P>To attempt to deal with the fundamental problems in the zoo through this Supplementary Estimate is deplorable. The problems have been there for a number of years.  I was a member of an <i>ad hoc</i> committee which had reason to visit the zoo when the elephant &ldquo;Judy&rdquo; was seen by the public to be in distress. The elephant eventually had to be put down.  As a lay person it was obvious to me that the facilities for elephants, particularly the outside facilities, were totally inadequate.  The zoo committee report clearly outlined that.</P>
      <P>The committee was set up by the Government in 1989 and still the report has not been published and made generally available to the public.  That shows a lack of commitment by the Government to the future of the zoo and its animals. The report recommended an injection of £5 million into the zoo, yet the report has not been put before us for consideration so that the sum could be considered in the Estimates.  It seems that there will not be any real financial commitment in order to implement the improvements required in the zoo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party want a restructured zoo with animal welfare being the priority.  There should be greater control over operations in the zoo.  This report has been on the desk of the Minister, <Col N="1566" /> admittedly not this Minister, for the last 18 months and it suggests that fundamental changes can be made, with certain improvements.  The report clearly states that some areas are satisfactory, some require modification and some require major improvements.  The report says that unless these improvements are made the areas in question should be closed down.</P>

      <P>I regret that we have no opportunity to discuss this fundamental report which is vital to the proper operation of the zoo.  I would ask the Minister to put the report before this House and let this House discuss it to see what is required so that the zoo can meet the requirements of the modern day and do justice to this country and this House.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister is new on the job, but I am very disappointed with his brief comment.  A very substantial report was issued by Mr. Mick Doyle 18 months ago.  I do not know if the Minister has got around to reading it. It is surprising that he has not said whether he agrees with the thrust of it. It is amazing that this report has not been published after 18 months although it is circulating and anybody can get hold of it.  Because it has not been officially published there can be no public debate on the contents of this major report.  It is a very fine report and I would agree with many if not all, of its recommendations. It points out that Dublin zoo's funding is totally inadequate and the consequent lack of facilities has caused distress particularly to the larger animals in the zoo over recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even before the report was issued the zoo had been looking for land, specifically, the President's lake.  I wrote to the previous President, President Hillery a couple of years ago in regard to this lake and the surrounding land, approximately 25 acres, to see if it could be made available to the zoo because it would be a tremendous facility and a wonderful <Col N="1567" /> entrance to áras an Uachtaráin with the wildlife element on one side.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works are reluctant to give up portions of land in the park.  They are very protective of the public lands of the park where people can wander about, and I can understand that. I would ask the Minister to look at their recommendations which are probably a bit drastic.  Also, the Dublin public are reluctant to see the old polo grounds going.  It is the only place where people can walk in and see a polo match free which other people can only see on television.</P>
    <P>Ashtown Castle, which was the residence of Alibrandi, the Papal Nuncio above áras an Uachtaráin has been refurbished by the Office of Public Works.  That is a very fine place for a wildlife park.  It has the old moat around it, as áras an Uachtaráin has, and so would be easily protected.  It will be open from January 1992 and will be a major tourist attraction.  It would be marvellous to have giraffes and other animals on each side as one went in, just as in Fota.  It was never open to the public before, so it would not be an intrusion on the Office of Public Works desire to keep the park open to the public.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this and the other recommendations of the report.  No previous Minister for Education has had the slightest interest in Dublin zoo, they did not want to know about it.  They had little enough to spend in their own Department without providing money for Dublin zoo.</P>
    <P>I think the zoo should be taken from the Department of Education.  I do not know if I would fully support the idea of a separate State company as recommended in Mr. Doyle's report but maybe the Office of Public Works could take it over as part of the park &mdash; they have wildlife parks in other areas of the country.  I certainly think it should be taken over by somebody with a specific interest in keeping the zoo open with ample space for animals.</P>
    <P>I was in Amsterdam zoo two months <Col N="1568" /> ago and I can say that their facilities in the elephant house were no better, in fact they were much worse, than the existing facilities in Dublin Zoo.  Dublin Zoo is not that much worse than other zoos.  I would say to those who want Dublin Zoo closed that there are worse areas of entrapment of animals in major piggeries and cattle fattening stations where animals are all held in captivity while they are being fattened up for slaughter.  The zoo is a major resource both for Dublin and nationally and is also a major scientific area.  I would urge the Minister to have the report published.  I am not sure what proposals are before the Government but I would hope they are in line with the recommendations here and that there will be definite funding, restructuring and a new zoo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I agree completely with what Deputies Ryan and Mac Giolla say about the non-publication of this report.  It is an absolute scandal and indicates there is no proper freedom of information in this country.  Of course, everyone has the report and it has just become a joke.  For some reason &mdash; stubbornness, I suppose &mdash; the Government have decided not to publish it.  I cannot blame the present Minister for this impasse.  I am sure he is a fair-minded man and will see the absolute absurdity of refusing to officially publish this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I want to say that we are opposing this Estimate.  There are so many issues to cover in such a short time. The first thing that is so unsatisfactory about it is that it is just a continuation of &ldquo;ad hocery&rdquo;.  This is the fourth time that the zoo have had to come cap in hand to the Government.  In fairness to the zoo they want some new permanent arrangements made.  They want a State company set up.  This should be done, and if we need legislation, let us get it through the House quickly.  We have had plenty of rushed legislation through the House, so let us rush this one through.  It should be fairly simple.  It would get the zoo on a proper basis even if it is only to phase it <Col N="1569" /> out in a way that will take into consideration the needs of the animals.</P>
    <P>I agree also with Deputy Mac Giolla that the zoo should be taken out of the ambit of the Department of Education. It clearly does not belong there.  The fact that it is there, illustrates that there is no legislation covering the welfare of animals in zoos.  Clearly legislation is needed in that area.  It is most unsatisfactory that taxpayers' money is given to any private concern without any accountability.</P>
    <P>The other Deputies in the House are broadly supportive of the principle of zoos.  That is where I would fundamentally disagree with them.  We have to see zoos basically as animal prisons. Animals are kept without their consent to gratify us.  It may have been educational 50 or 60 years ago but nowadays it is no longer educational.  There is no serious educational input at all, so let us put that one to rest.  If children or adults want to study wild animals they have plenty of opportunities to watch television and films and read illustrated books which were not available to people when zoos were started up.  The zoo of the future will be opening in Leicester in 1995.  It will be an animalless zoo which would seem a very peculiar concept.  It will have a whole series of videos and examples of wildlife habitat.  That is the road we should be going down.</P>
    <P>Together with Deputy Ryan, I was involved in a small <i>ad hoc</i> group of Dáil Deputies who visit the zoo from time to time, and like Deputy Ryan, I am very concerned about the condition of the large animals in particular.  The recent history of Dublin Zoo with regard to the elephants is very disturbing.  There has been tremendous cruelty &mdash; unintentional, no doubt &mdash; and two of the elephants had to be put down recently. In addition, one of the polar bear cubs was eaten by its father.  This is a clear indication that the Dublin Zoo authorities are not capable of looking after large wild animals.  We will not solve the problem by giving them more money.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1991. - Vote 32: Agriculture and Food.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1991, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission, and for payment of certain grants, subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>As this is my first time in this House to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for my Department I propose to make some introductory remarks on the Common Agricultural Policy reform, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations and the general economic situation before going on to speak on a selection of the subheads covered in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>There are two issues which have dominated all discussions on agriculture over the past year and these are the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations are concerned, the details of the Commission's proposals have already been outlined on a number of occasions in this House and I do not propose to go into them again. I have also made it clear that I accept that it is necessary to modify some of the mechanisms of the support arrangements so as to tackle underlying market imbalances in some sectors and to sustain <Col N="1571" /> farmer incomes, but I do have very serious difficulties with the way the Commission is proposing to achieve those objectives.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the Commission proposals is to partially switch supports away from the traditional approach of guaranteed prices to one with greater emphasis on direct payments.  In my view, the proposals go much too far and too fast.  I am not happy either with the modalities and scope of the compensatory elements of the proposals. They will have to be significantly adapted if they are to be acceptable to me.  I also have major problems in relation to the production control elements of the proposals and in particular the proposed milk quota cuts.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Council began detailed negotiations on the Commission's proposals at the November Council.  These were continued at the Council over the past two days.  The negotiations will resume under the Portuguese Presidency in the New Year.</P>
    <P>These negotiations will be long and difficult.  Farmers and all associated with the agri-food sector can be assured that I am determined to secure the most favourable possible result for Irish agriculture. My aim in these negotiations is to ensure that the reformed Common Agricultural Policy continues to adequately support market prices and that the main element of producers' incomes continues to be derived from the market.  I am insisting that the compensatory measures cater for our needs, that they are permanent and sustained by durable and adequate Community financial resources.  This matter of financing is a precondition to any agreement on reform and I have made this very clear to my colleagues in the Council and to Commissioner MacSharry.  It is essential that the compensatory payments fall into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade &ldquo;green box&rdquo; of subsidies which are to be exempted from General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade discipline.  The needs of economies such as our own with its high dependence on agriculture must <Col N="1572" /> be recognised in the reforms.  This is an essential point in our position.</P>
    <P>In reality the Common Agricultural Policy reform discussions are very much in their infancy.  There is a long hard road ahead but I am prepared to go every step of the way to ensure a fair deal for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations should conclude this year or early next year.  Agreement was not reached last year because of differences mainly between the US and the EC on a number of issues including agriculture. Negotiations at technical level throughout the year have clarified some aspects but the major political matters are still unresolved.  The recent EC/US high level contacts have narrowed the differences on some aspects.  The US now seem willing to consider levels of reductions which are more in line with the EC position.  However, significant differences remain on aspects such as the choice of base year, modalities for tariffication, minimum access, the treatment of direct aids, export supports and rebalancing. Negotiations are continuing between both parties to see if some accommodation can be achieved on these as well as on the more fundamental question of the level of reductions to be made.</P>
    <P>My priorities in the negotiations are to ensure that any commitments are realistic, coherent and balanced so that the supports provided by the Common Agricultural Policy are not undermined. I want to ensure that the Community's conditions for the acceptance of tariffication are adhered to so that adequate Community preference can be maintained.</P>
    <P>On export refunds, I cannot accept restrictions which are not coherent with internal support or protection mechanisms or which would limit the Community's ability to take part in the anticipated expansion of world trade following the end of the round.  I will also be seeking to ensure that credit is obtained for reform measures taken since 1986.  It is also vitally important to me to ensure that the various compensatory <Col N="1573" /> mechanisms which may flow from Common Agricultural Policy reform are contained in the &ldquo;green box&rdquo; of support policies to be continued without further discipline.</P>
    <P>It is in all our interests to conclude an agreement and so avoid costly and damaging trade wars.  However, it cannot be an agreement at any cost.  The Community has made a reasonable and balanced offer.  It is also undertaking the most fundamental reform of its internal support policies to date.  I cannot accept that the Community alone should bear the burden of reforms.  Other countries have also contributed to world trade problems and all parties must bear their share of the burden if global problems are to be resolved.</P>
    <P>In summary, there is no doubt but that the Commission's Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals represent a definite shift from price income support. Neither can there be any doubt but that, compared to the present situation, these proposals, if adopted, would represent a loss for Irish farming and the agriculture industry.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that the GATT negotiations would, if concluded on lines close to those now emerging, result in a substantial cut in Community support for agriculture.  This would also, of course, mean losses, at least in the short to medium term, for the Irish agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>In the context of the action which may be required after a GATT agreement, the Commission proposals could be seen as a factor which defines and limits the fall out for agriculture and the food industry. This would certainly be the case if many of our negotiating aims were achieved, but, even so, the overall result will inevitably involve some cost to the industry and the economy.  What we are engaged in now is trying to create the basis of a viable and more market oriented industry while minimising the cost in the short term.</P>
    <P>We can best achieve this by more gradual and less extreme price adjustments allied to production control; providing adequate and permanent <Col N="1574" /> compensation to include commercial farmers and with full recognition of the position of grass based extensive livestock producers; effective support mechanisms to maintain the new price levels; and assuring a guaranteed and permanent financial framework for the new regime.</P>
    <P>It now seems likely that GNP will increase by about 0.5-1 per cent in 1991, although some estimates have it as high as 2 per cent.  This compares quite favourably with growth in most other European countries and especially with the 2 per cent decline expected in the UK.  The Central Bank projects a surplus in the balance of payments of around £879 million or roughly 3.75 per cent of GNP in 1991.  Inflation was again very low by international standards during 1991 with the rate for the year as a whole being 3.1 per cent.  An even lower rate of inflation is now being forecast for 1992.</P>
    <P>Interest rates have again tended downwards during 1991.  During the year the short term rate, which tends to govern interest rates in the retail banks, was reduced by two steps of 0.5 per cent to reach 10.25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The agri-food sector continues to be of vital importance in the Irish economy, much greater proportionally than for the average EC Twelve.  In 1990, agriculture accounted for 10.1 per cent of GDP, 14.8 per cent of employment and 14 per cent of exports.  If goods and drinks are included, these account for about 19 per cent of employment and 23 per cent of exports.</P>
    <P>The £1.1 million provided in this Supplementary Estimate is to cover the initial costs of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry.  The Estimate otherwise would have balanced out for the year.  Deputies will see that Vote expenditure is up by £55 million compared to the original provision.  This arose from extra expenditure on farm investment and intervention activity which is, of course, designed to support producer prices.  This additional expenditure is mainly offset by increased EC intervention receipts.</P>
    <P>I propose to focus my remarks on four <Col N="1575" /> subheads in particular.  Before doing so, I would like to say a few words on the subject of headage payments in the disadvantaged areas.  I am happy to tell the House that the number of such payments made will be well in line with previous years.  Some £80 million in all will be paid in 1991.  This is the highest amount ever paid on headage payments in Ireland. The balance will be paid early in the new year.  In addition to the headage payments, which are confined to the disadvantaged areas, a further £185 million will be paid this year to farmers throughout the country under the cattle and sheep premium schemes which are fully funded by the EC.  I am aware that the rules laid down by the EC for the operation of these schemes continue to cause difficulties for some farmers. Deputies have brought this to my attention through questions, particularly written questions.  I have communicated with the Commission as to the possibility of having the rules amended for future years.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Taoiseach's speech of 24 May 1991 the expenses arising in the work of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry were to be the subject of a Supplementary Estimate for my Department.  As of now, it is not possible to give an accurate estimate of when the tribunal is likely to complete their work nor of the final outturn of costs.  At this time the Supplementary Estimate for 1991 is in respect of initial startup costs of the tribunal and payments which have been made to date. There will, of course, be further costs arising in 1992.  I do not propose to refer at this time to the work of the tribunal. As this House established this legal forum to examine these matters, let us allow the tribunal conduct their inquiries and make their report before any conclusions are drawn or debated.</P>
    <P>As regards the financial costs and receipts of market intervention measures, Deputies will note that with the high level of intervention activity this year, expenditure in this area has increased from last year.  Most of this <Col N="1576" /> increased expenditure will be financed by increased intervention receipts.</P>
    <P>My Department recently completed, with the help of outside consultants, an information techonology strategy study which led to the production of a three to five year plan for further development of computerisation to support the business and broad objectives of the Department. The cost of this study accounts for the additional expenditure on the consultancy services &mdash; subhead A8.  The plan envisages a major development in the computerisation of my Department. The major area to be tackled is the design and development of a cattle movement permit-headage system to support the work of ERAD and headage payments. It will be a major advance on the existing disease testing system in the district veterinary offices.  Selection of outside consultants to work with Department staff on the project is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>The second area to be developed is a client database.  This will integrate scheme data; do away with duplication; provide a common registration point for all of the Department's clients; give greater control to analyse financial and other information and pave the way for the delivery of services in various parts of the country.  The selection of a more powerful mainframe to support all these developments is being considered by my Department.  The enhanced hardware will be installed in the new year.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for an additional £2.9 million under subhead L.1 on farm investment.  This is to cover the cost of grant payments to farmers in respect of works undertaken under the various farm development schemes.  The original provision under this heading was £45.6 million.  The demand has been greater than expected and the indications are that expenditure this year will be in the region of £48.5 million.  The increased demand for grant aid is a reflection of the high level of on-farm investment.  It is estimated that this will exceed £100 million this year.  Such a level of activity is an indication that despite the temporary difficulties they are facing, Irish farmers <Col N="1577" /> still have confidence in the future of the industry.</P>
    <P>Much of this investment is in relation to the control of farmyard pollution. Judging by the response it is obvious that our farmers know their responsibilities and are taking steps to ensure that the environment is not damaged by off farm waste.  This is a welcome development and one which I am glad to encourage. In general this type of investment does not produce an immediate economic return.  It is important, therefore, that there is sufficient funding available to enable grants to be paid as soon as projects are completed.  I am, therefore, seeking an additional £2.9 million for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I urge the House to support this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be opposing this Supplementary Estimate because we are very concerned about the lack of planning and of a policy on the future of the agricultural industry.  As the Minister pointed out, we are now in the midst of negotiations on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I see this as a process of disintegration of the Common Agricultural Policy, as we have known it over the years.  I do not see any attempt being made here to formulate a national policy to make up for the grave deficiencies that will arise as a result of the disintegration of the Common Agricultural Policy. What we are about to see is a policy of renationalisation by the wealthier states in the Community.  The day is fast approaching when the Germans, the British, the French, the Italians, the Dutch and the Danes will subsidise their farmers very heavily and leave the farmers in the poor countries of the Community such as Ireland to paddle their own canoe.  In the light of this scenario we should be busily engaged in drawing up an agricultural policy solely designed to protect the future of the agricultural industry here. That is not being done.  We should have embarked on this course several years ago when the indications were first given of a major reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We are not talking about <Col N="1578" /> reform but dismantlement of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>Commissioner MacSharry tried to appease us over the past year by saying that farmers would be compensated for the loss of income arising from cutbacks in production or prices.  Yesterday, however, a most frightening message emanated from the meeting of the Council of Ministers in Brussels &mdash; and I am sure the Minister, who attended, was just as alarmed as were all of us at home. Indications were given that irrespective of the compensation that may be allowed under the terms of the reform proposals of the Common Agricultural Policy, these compensatory measures may be removed in subsequent GATT negotiations. The Minister made an explicit reference to that proposal today.  This is a highly undesirable proposal which will shatter farmers' confidence in the future of their industry.  I would like the Minister to refer to that at greater length in his reply.  The EC may grant reasonable compensatory measures but they are under threat because they may be removed in subsequent GATT negotiations. We do not have a guarantee that the compensatory measures will continue indefinitely.  This must be the greatest cause for alarm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to be alarmed in any event because the renationalisation I spoke of does not suit this country.  We do not have the natural resources to subsidise our farmers, as would be the case in Britain, Germany and France.  It appears the tendency is that the Germans will spread their money around Europe in a more general fashion than is presently the case.  Naturally, they will spend a great deal on protecting their own farmers and the farmers of former East Germany who have been assimilated into the German system over the past year. They will feel obliged to help countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and even Yugoslavia where they have strong ethnic connections.  They will feel more justified in giving aid to those countries than to countries such as Ireland, which is on the periphery of Europe and does not have such ethnic <Col N="1579" /> connections.  We will also be looked upon as a country that has benefited for virtually 20 years from the Common Agricultural Policy.  There will not be the same allegiance to granting aid to Ireland as was the case over the past 18 to 20 years.</P>
    <P>We are facing into a very dangerous and difficult period.  I have reasonable confidence that the Minister for Agriculture and Food will be able to spot the imminent dangers and take steps to avert the worst aspects of the proposals which are emanating from Brussels.  Some of the proposals on renationalisation are visible and others are not, but there is a trend towards subsidisation by Governments in other countries and we will not be able to compete with that.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in subhead L4, which has to do with intervention.  I have said publicly and repeat that we in this country have a lot to answer for in relation to the development of agriculture. Our reliance on EC mechanisms such as intervention and export refunds has been an absolute disgrace.  I used the word &ldquo;reliance&rdquo;, but I should actually talk about abuse.  For 18 years we have been abusing the intervention system, a system which should be used as an emergency mechanism to help farmers in times of glut and of particular difficulty but instead of using intervention for that purpose, we have used it as if it were an integral part of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We could be about to pay very dearly for that abuse, for the very serious mistake we have made.</P>
    <P>I blame many people for that abuse, particularly the farming organisations.  I blame politicians &mdash; some of us have advocated moving away from dependence on intervention, but others have taken the soft option by saying that intervention will always be there so we should continue to make use of it.  Intervention and export refunds will not always be there.  Ireland has to devise an individual policy and system of self-dependence, because that is where we are heading. <Col N="1580" /> Renationalisation means self-dependence, but Ireland is not prepared for that at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am not here to goad or to abuse the Minister, I am here to be helpful.  I tell him that in the current talks on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy Ireland should specifically look for a derogation so that in a specified period we can do what we have failed to do in the past 18 years.  We need a chance to reduce and eventually get rid of our dependence on intervention and export refunds.  The agricultural industry needs an opportunity to come to terms with the fact that there will not be hand-outs from Europe forever.</P>
    <P>This week a most disturbing development took place.  The one thing the agricultural industry needs most of all is enlightenment.  However, it is going backwards &mdash; it is going into the backwoods. The very processes that would help Ireland to become financially independent in the agricultural world are being almost eliminated.  If Ireland is to devise a policy and a strategy for independence in agriculture, then we need well-educated young farmers, a massive amount of research and development and, probably most important, the ability to market.  However, all of those areas are being starved of money.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday there was a day-long meeting of the State body for research and development and advisory services, Teagasc, aimed at holding off the closure of a list of agricultural training centres and research centres.  How can an independent agricultural industry or an independent policy be developed without the nuts and bolts needed to build that industry? We must have education, we must have more research and development and we must have better marketing techniques.</P>
    <P>An unfortunate fact of life is that 50 to 60 per cent of all of the milk products produced in Ireland at present go into intervention.  Almost as much of the beef produced here goes into intervention. What will become of the industry and <Col N="1581" /> what will become of the farming community and the rural community when the supports are withdrawn?</P>
    <P>There should not be less money spent on the ingredients vital for a proper agricultural programme; a massive injection of capital is needed.  The amount spent on research and development has reduced from £45 million in 1987 to £29 million this year.  Much of that money is being spent on paying pensions and redundancy money.  The actual amount provided for research and development and education in agriculture is being reduced daily.  Our efforts are going in the wrong direction. I used an agricultural expression to describe our position the other day, but it is an expression that is very appropriate; in this country we are eating the seed potato.</P>
    <P>There should not be cuts in Teagasc, there should not be cuts in research and development or in advisory services and there should not be cuts in education. There should be a massive injection of finance into all of those areas, and I ask the Minister to give that issue his immediate attention.  I suggest that Structural Funds from Europe should be diverted to provide the kind of facilities that are so badly needed.</P>
    <P>If steps are not taken to have the position improved, then the future for agriculture is extraordinarily bleak.  Initially, education must be the focus of attention, research and development must be next and we must then be able to sell what has been developed.  The days of producing butter and skimmed milk powder to put into storage are fast coming to an end. Eventually those products are sold off to Russia or Cuba for 10p a pound, whereas they cost more than 100p a pound to produce.  Such lunacy cannot continue.</P>
    <P>The co-operative movement in the agribusiness must move towards the production of goods that can be sold on the open market &mdash; goods that can be sold, goods that do not have to be put into storage, goods upon which money is not wasted.  It is very hard to get that message across to people who have become accustomed to a system whereby they can stash everything they produce into storage and <Col N="1582" /> not worry about its sale.  Those days are coming to an end; that system cannot last.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about doing a good job in the Agricultural portfolio then he will have to inject massive sums of money into the areas I have mentioned. Whether he gets the money from the national Exchequer or from Europe is fairly irrelevant; the fact is that the money must be obtained.  I cannot honestly foresee the Minister getting the money from the national Exchequer in the present financial climate, but surely the money is available from Europe.  We have Structural Funds for everything under the sun but there seems to be no large injection of Structural Funds into the areas that would contribute to the revitalisation of our major industry, agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about taking an organised approach to agriculture.  I shall point out a typical example of the contradiction existing at the moment.  Subhead L1, farm improvement grants, includes land reclamation.  When it comes to the nonsense at present taking place within the EC, which we witness at first hand in this country, could there be anything more glaring than farmers being paid grants to reclaim mediocre or marginal land, wet land, rock land while, on the other hand, they are being encouraged to set aside the best land?  I should like people to dwell on that.  It is the craziest thing imaginable spending millions of pounds reclaiming bad land and, on the other hand, paying farmers not to sow crops on good land.  That is a vivid illustration of the contradiction in EC policies and in our national policies, and speaks volumes.</P>
    <P>We have no policy, no structures in place, to face up to the challenge of the future.  We must educate our young farmers and develop products we can sell.  We must get away from our dependence on intervention.  I feel sorry for farmers with young families hoping that their families will be able to continue to work those family farms.  How, in God's name, can they expect those children to make a living unless we, the politicians, change <Col N="1583" /> the system and devise one that will work, because the present system will not work in the future?  We have abused that system and cannot allow it to continue.  We are being totally irresponsible in our attitude. When I see the numbers of people employed in Teagasc research and advisory services reduced from 2,200 in 1987 to 1,400 at present and a further proposal to reduce those numbers to 1,050, I shudder at the future for those young people. We are in the process of more than halving the numbers of people involved in these vital services.</P>

The former Minister for Agriculture and Food, the present Minister for Labour, got very annoyed with me here this morning when I asked him to explain publicly the statement he made to the House on 15 May last.  He must explain it because it has all to do with the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry.  I will quote briefly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Deasy is a fair and honest man.  May I say to him that he has heard here on several occasions statements from the Chair &mdash; indeed he has heard it from <Col N="1584" /> the tribunal itself &mdash; that the tribunal is applying itself to the deliberations requested and required of it.  Therefore, everything dealing with the tribunal itself is <i>sub judice.</i>  In respect of utterances made here I think Deputy Deasy will accept that this is not a court of law.  Statements are made and if a Deputy accuses another Deputy of having made a statement and that Deputy or Minister disclaims it, there is nothing much we can do beyond that.  The same protection would apply to the Deputy in such circumstances.</P>

If you will not allow me to use a quotation, Sir, I want to refer the Members of the House to the debate that took place in this House on 15 May last. In particular, I want to refer to the Official Report, column 1267, of that day where the former Minister is quoted, and to the fact that he was wrongly contradicted last week at the tribunal by a former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture.  We are all entitled, particularly the Members of this House, to an explanation of that statement.</P>

As a constituency colleague I am pleased that he got what I understood to be a long-hoped for change in portfolio, having contributed as well as he did to the Social Welfare brief in the years he occupied that office.  I wish him well and hope we will see less of him in the constituency as a result, but we will maintain matters in order there in the meantime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt.  This Estimate provides more than £1 million for the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry now under way in Dublin Castle.  It is a very substantial sum which arises directly from a decision already taken by the Dáil, and clearly we must now provide the funds to meet its needs.</P>
      <P>Tribunals of inquiry are always expensive and the final costs of this one are likely to be very substantial.  Indeed I would be doubtful if the amount involved in this Supplementary Estimate will cover the full costs of the tribunal.  In replying perhaps the Minister could indicate whether any estimate is available of the likely final cost.  I know the Minister has said that that probably is impossible but I should be glad if he would say, from his experience and/or advice what the overall cost is likely to be.</P>
      <P>The task undertaken by Mr. Justice Hamilton is a mammoth one as the scope of the inquiry is very wide, embracing the activities of an entire industry over several years.  Anybody who has attended any of the hearings, or who has been following the media reports, cannot but be impressed by the diligent and comprehensive manner in which Mr. Justice Hamilton and the tribunal's legal team have gone about their task.  We hope they will now get to the truth of this affair and settle matters accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also take this opportunity to acknowledge the very good work done by the media in covering the deliberations and business of the tribunal, ensuring that the public are kept abreast of developments as they occur daily.  It is perhaps regrettable that the tribunal and/or the media did not take the opportunity to consider the televising of their affairs.  In time it will be an inevitable development that all court proceedings in this country will be available to the television cameras.  In saying that I am not prompted by anything I have seen in another country in regard to a recent trial.  The more involved use of the media <Col N="1586" /> and their technologies in reporting matters is an inevitable consequence and extension of the democratic process.  Perhaps the tribunal would have been an excellent starting point for meeting media technology, the courts and their operations.  Perhaps it is a pity that the television cameras were not brought into the hearing room of the tribunal at the outset.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that there was considerable controversy, at the tribunal and in this House, as to what legal team was representing the public interest there.  Most people expected that the legal team representing the Attorney General would represent the public interest.  But it was clear from the early days of the tribunal that the brief given to the State's legal team was that their priority was to defend the interests of Government Ministers and public bodies against whom accusations had been made.  The statement by Mr. Justice Hamilton on 25 November, in which he asked the tribunal's own legal team to have special regard to the public interest, helped to clarify the position.  However, as we pointed out at the time, it imposes an additional burden of responsibility on the tribunal's own legal team while leaving the Attorney General's team unburdened in this regard and exclusively preoccupied with representing the State agencies against whom allegations have been made.</P>
    <P>A further conflict of interest can be anticipated when the issue of export credit insurance comes to be dealt with. It is difficult to envisage how counsel for the Attorney General can defend the allegations and, at the same time, represent the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, the original principal accuser in this regard when he was an occupant of the Opposition benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this is not really our function here. The deliberations will be carried out in whatever fashion is decided upon there. It is not our function, nor is it desirable, to refer to the outcome or to anticipate <Col N="1587" /> its shortcomings.  The decision has been made and any contribution here is not likely to change it.  Apart from the fact that we might be accused by the tribunal of infringing on their responsibilities, it seems to be a rather useless exercise to comment in any respect on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have finished what I wanted to say in that regard.  We deliberated on these matters earlier in the session and those deliberations led to a useful clarification by the chairman of the tribunal.  The issue will inevitably reemerge when the important matter of the export credit scheme is considered.</P>
      <P>The second and perhaps most important part of this Estimate is an additional allocation of £6 million to cover increased costs arising from the intervention system.  This focuses attention once again on the whole Common Agricultural Policy, which at last seems about to be subject to some degree of reform if the MacSharry plan goes ahead.  We have persistently queried the value and morality of a policy which produces goods for which there is no market, which adds up to £15 per week to a consumer's food bill, which consumes 60 per cent of the entire EC budget and allows 80 per cent of all price supports to go to the top 20 per cent income bracket.</P>
      <P>The intervention system is the cornerstone of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Where is the morality in the Community buying huge quantities of meat and dairy products and locking them away in some warehouse to deteriorate and decay while millions of people are starving to death in the Third World? Where is the morality in paying huge sums to cold store owners to store meat and dairy products when there are many families in my constituency for whom real butter and meat are a rare treat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dependence of Irish agriculture on the intervention system is a shameful indictment of the policies of successive Governments.  There are more than 300,000 tonnes of beef and dairy products held in intervention, with a value of around £300 million.  Ireland accounts for <Col N="1588" /> only a small proportion of total Community agricultural production, but we are one of the biggest users of the intervention system.  As of May this year this country accounted for almost 40 per cent of skimmed milk powder held in intervention by the EC.  We produce only about 5 per cent of the Community's butter but account for about 30 per cent of intervention stocks.  Almost 25 per cent of beef held in intervention is Irish.</P>
    <P>During the past year we have witnessed the totally immoral spectacle of families, including farming families, being unable to put adequate food on their tables, while at the same time we had to resort to hiring South American ships to anchor in Cork Harbour and store intervention butter because every cold store was already full to the brim.  The provision of cold storage facilities for intervention products is itself a big business.  The Minister told my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, last July that the total cost of storage this year would be £62.5 million.  The beef barons are paid £4.80 per week to store each tonne of boned beef and get £2.40 for each tonne of boneless beef.  He added that the cost of storage aboard ship is approximately three times greater than land based storage.  Those who have done best out of the Common Agricultural Policy are not the farmers or the consumers but the beef barons, the cold storage owners and South American shippers.  It is proposed in the Estimate to extend and continue this system which does not benefit farmers or consumers and for that reason we will be opposing the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In the short term we need to devise a strategy to get food out of the intervention stores and on the plates of those who need it, at home and abroad. The huge quantities of skimmed milk powder would certainly save lives in many Third World countries.  The provision of meat and butter, even at a reduced rate, would make a major difference to the efforts of many low income families at home to make ends meet. There was a number of limited distributions some years ago but they seem to have been quietly dropped while we <Col N="1589" /> keep throwing foodstuffs into cold stores and warehouses until they reach bursting point.</P>
    <P>The days of the Common Agricultural Policy in its present form are numbered. Everyone accepts that and knows that the Community will not continue to spend huge sums of money on the intervention system.  Rather than fighting an unwinnable battle to preserve the Common Agricultural Policy in its present form, we should be insisting that any reduction in EC farm supports is matched by a compensating increase in Structural Funding for Ireland.  Such a development would be of far more benefit to all sectors, including farmers, than the present wasteful spending under the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>The long term aim of the national agriculture policy must be to enable the land to provide the maximum possible number of families with decent incomes and increase its overall contribution to the economy in terms of income generated and employment created.  The Estimate before us addresses none of these fundamental issues and we will be opposing it.  I thank the Chair and Deputy Kavanagh for facilitating me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the Minister in his new portfolio.  Only three weeks ago I called for a change in this area and I particularly welcome the appointment of this Minister. His record in his previous Ministry shows that he is a very caring, aware and dedicated Minister.  This is what this Department needs now and in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister takes over at a time of crisis in confidence and in direction among farmers themselves and the associated industries.  The four main farm organisations came together when the proposals for the restructuring of the Common Agricultural Policy were announced.  They indicated to the then Minister that if those proposals were to be carried out it would mean a fall of 20 per cent annually in farm output.  They estimated the annual depreciation in the value of output at £684 million.  That is a staggering figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> I am aware that the Minister has been engaged in discussions during the past few days to avert the worst features of the proposals emanating from Brussels. He must also face the GATT negotiations. Everybody in agriculture is concerned about the outcome of these discussions.  No matter how hard the Minister tries, it is believed that very extensive change will take place which will not be to the benefit of the farming community.  I was glad that the Minister, in introducing the Estimate, was allowed to give us some idea how these discussions are going.  We are generally kept on a tight rein during these debates, but I hope we will be allowed in turn to make some comments on these matters.</P>
    <P>The Estimate before us indicates a demand for £1.1 million to cover various areas, but before dealing with it I would refer to the promise made by the Minister on taking office to draw up a national development plan for agriculture.  This commitment was given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I wish the Minister well in bringing forward this plan which, as can be seen from the difficulties in agriculture is urgent.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister will be in a position to tell us today when the plan will be announced or the length of time it will take to be implemented.  He should take into account not only the agricultural sectors but the wider community also.  Agriculture is our largest industry and impacts on every area of life.  People may not believe it but our economy and the purchasing power of people depend more on agriculture than any other industry. Shops and businesses in Dublin depend on a vibrant agricultural industry for their survival as much as corner shops in Shillelagh, Tinahely or Wicklow town. A development plan for agriculture which will restore the confidence which has been missing in this sector as a result of the scandals and events of the past year is badly needed.  I hope the policy adopted by the Minister will bring the crisis in agriculture to an end.  There is no need for me to mention the problems being experienced by people in all sectors of agriculture today because everybody <Col N="1591" /> knows them.  However, because of debates on other issues over the past few months we have devoted very little time to debating agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>A few weeks ago one day was devoted to a debate on a report on agriculture.  So far as I am aware, it is a long time since a report on agriculture produced by a committee of this House was debated here.  That very important debate was overshadowed by other events.  Reference was made in the debate to the crises in the beef, cereals, milk, sheepmeat sectors and so on. Unfortunately, these issues seem to be of little interest to the media.  If this country is to succeed and thrive the attention given to the other activities which are taking place needs to be given to these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead L.4 of the Vote refers to a sum of £50 million for payments in respect of storage, freezing, handling, transport and so on under market intervention arrangements.  Deputy Deasy referred to the cost of intervention and intervention stocks.  This morning I heard on the radio that housewives in Russia, a once great country, have to queue for bread, milk and meat.  It is terrible to think that we have intervention stocks piled up to the roof in plants throughout the country when people are starving in different regions of the world.  As has been said, we have had to hire ships to store some of our excess production.  A limit should be put on the financial aid given by the EC to the Third World and East European countries so that once that limit is reached we will resort to giving aid by way of intervention stocks. It is very difficult to understand how countries in Europe can give arms to countries which are marginalised in terms of their standard of living but cannot give them intervention stocks which are readily available.  The distribution of these surpluses is not just a problem for Ireland; it is also a problem for the EC. In view of the cost of intervention one of the best things the European Community <Col N="1592" /> could do is give these stocks to the Third World.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to the TB eradication scheme.  I hope the development plan to be introduced by the Minister will improve this scheme. Spokespersons for some of the agricultural organisations have said that this scourge will never be brought to an end under the present scheme.  Until such time as the operation and management of this scheme are improved we will merely continue to pour money down a black hole.  Last year more than £33 million was paid by farmers in fees and costs under this scheme.  Many farmers are unable to sell their cattle because one reactor was found in their herds.  The Minister should set a timescale for the elimination of this disease.  ERAD should be given the same timescale as Teagasc to organise themselves so that they can do the work they were set up to do.  I do not understand how this level of finance can continue to be wasted every year when no obvious improvement can be seen in the elimination of this disease.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say he has improved the situation in regard to the payment of headage grants particularly to farmers in disadvantaged areas. However, I am concerned that he may be only catching up with outstanding payments and that many farmers who hoped to be paid this year will not be paid until after Christmas.  One of the problems relates to the filling in of complicated forms.  While these forms are required for administration purposes, in many cases claims cannot be paid in the current year. I hope the Minister will improve the procedures.</P>
    <P>We had a brief comment on the operation of the tribunal.  I do not intend to deal with that issue; it is being dealt with adequately in the media.  I should like to ask the Minister if he is in possession of information, as I am, which suggests that agricultural officers in the meat factories and on TB eradication work have not been paid overtime and subsistence allowances for work carried out as far back as last September.  The cases which have been brought to my <Col N="1593" /> notice suggest that sums of £1,500 or an average of £500 to £700 for overtime and subsistence allowances are outstanding to these officers.  We all like some extra money at Christmas time and if we earn it we expect to be paid within a reasonable time.  When I was informed of the case of the agricultural officers I found it hard to believe.  Yesterday, I took the opportunity to telephone the payments office in Cavan town and I was left in no doubt that under subhead C.2 there is no money left to pay these people.  Unless money is made available these officers, their wifes and families will not have extra money to provide goods, toys and the various other things that people like to have at Christmas.  I am sure the Minister experienced this type of problem when he was Minister for Social Welfare and that he dealt with it so far as was possible at Christmas time.  He can take it from me that genuine hardship will be created for people who do the field work in the meat factories and who are under severe pressure, many of whom we have seen march across the gravelled triangle in Dublin Castle where they have to prove their worth in that very difficult tribunal.  We must ensure that people who are doing the field work in the factories are paid what is due to them. Perhaps the Minister would examine the position and ensure that these moneys are paid out before Christmas.</P>
    <P>The reclassification of disadvantaged areas has been the subject of discussion in this House.  There are differing views as to the work the disadvantaged areas appeal board can do.  A promise has been made to set up the appeal board but there is a doubt about the necessary resources being made available.  As I understand it, work in this area is at a standstill because of lack of resources.  I had hoped for something in this Estimate today that would ensure that the important work of the reclassification board could continue.</P>
    <P>Finally, we will not have the opportunity to discuss again the threatened closure of the establishments under the aegis of Teagasc, about ten in all.  Nevertheless I welcome the reversal of the decision to close the Grange beef <Col N="1594" /> research station.  If this decision was arrived at before the Minister came into office perhaps he would agree to taking time to have a close look at the area of research for the agricultural industry. This matter was dealt with very ably by Deputy Deasy.  There is a need for this type of research and development to continue apace rather than be reduced by cutbacks.  There are 600 jobs involved in the proposed cutbacks.  We must take into account the fact that the removal of the Dublin and Cork milk boards will result in redundancies in the AI area.  As I believe most of these decisions were taken before Deputy Woods became Minister for Agriculture and Food, I would ask him to take the opportunity over Christmas to examine them in detail.  The Milk Bill is in the Seanad at present.  Because there was an error in the Bill when produced in this House I would ask the Minister to disregard it and come back with a new one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Nevertheless I hope that the Minister will produce a more comprehensive declaration of the development plan that we can support.  At present because of the crisis in agriculture we have to take this opportunity to demonstrate to the Government that we are opposed to <Col N="1595" /> what has happened in agriculture in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I wish to outline my opposition to this Supplementary Estimate on the basis of its insufficiency which is clearly indicated by virtue of proposals to phase out a number of research stations throughout the country.  Like my colleague, Deputy Deasy, who initially outlined his opposition to this proposal, I would like also to underline the foolhardiness of any proposal by any Government Department to phase out the research and development section of an industry at a time when research and development is more important than at any other time in the history of the State.  If we are to compete in the international arena, or even on the home market &mdash; at a time when unemployment is at a peak and we have to depend on core industries &mdash; we need to put more money, time, effort and energy into research and development than ever before.  I should point out that the agriculture and food industry has the best potential for providing badly needed jobs.  It is flying in the face of the facts, of the evidence and the experience of those who have been involved down through the years, that at this vital time, when the dependency for job creation must be focused on the agriculture and food industry, it should be deemed fit to save what can be only a miserable amount of money by cutting off research and development and by saying that we no longer need it.  The policy is being borrowed from the Eurocrats who have deemed that food and agriculture in this country will no longer play a major role in Europe.  It is clear from what we saw in the past few months that the bureaucrats have decided that after the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy there will not be any need to bother with research and development.  In the Department of Agriculture and Food there now appears to be an opinion that there will not be any need to continue with research and development after the Common Agricultural Policy reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> I welcome the Minister to the debate. This is our first opportunity to have an eyeball to eyeball discussion across the floor.  I wish the Minister every success in his new portfolio.  He knows the subject very well and I hope his knowledge will stand him in good stead in his discussions with his European counterparts.  I was interested to hear him say this morning that there were certain things with which he was not happy and I hope he will pursue his views vigorously.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come into this Department at a time when it seems that the future of the industry has been predetermined in the Council, and perhaps in the Commission.  I hope the Minister can vigorously impress his opinion on the Commissioner and on the European bureaucracy generally who seems to have such control over our future.  If the Minister responds as well to the promptings from this side of the House and from his own side as he did in his previous Department, he will be extremely successful.</P>
    <P>The one thing that worries me in relation to Common Agricultural Policy reform, which is very much in the news at the moment, is the proposal to make ongoing payments to farmers to get out of production.  That is crazy.  It was referred to by Deputy Deasy.  When the Commissioner kindly met the members of the joint EC secondary legislation committee I asked him whether these payments would be continued after a certain period, and I was assured that they would.  If the Commissioner believes that and the Minister believes it they are more naive than I took them for.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The payments now being offered to the productive sector in agriculture to get people out of business are merely sweeteners to encourage them out of the production arena, and once they are out they will be cut adrift.  These payments are being offered in the same way the intervention packages were offered some years ago. There will be a battle to determine whether they should remain in place for a period, but ultimately there will be a reaction against them and they will be <Col N="1597" /> scrapped simply because they are unsustainable.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect any productive sector to be encouraged to do nothing, to do less or withdraw from the arena. Imagine going to a factory owner and offering to pay him not to produce furniture, for instance.  One would be laughed off the face of the earth.  Ironically, this seems to be what we are doing with agriculture.  I emphasise agriculture, and agriculture and food, not because it is a good thing to do politically but because, as Deputy Kavanagh just said, nobody bothers, the local communities do not seem to be worried about it.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals are being sold on the basis of a promise of cheap food to the consumer.  That will be another laugh, because if the consumer thinks he will have cheaper food after the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, he has another think coming.  Ten or 15 years ago we were told of the prospective benefits of EC membership.  We were told that when certain measures were put in place we would have cheaper motor cars, cheaper electricity, cheaper telecommunications and that other services would be cheaper.  Now, at last, food is to be cheaper.  At the same time the Americans in the context of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are telling the world that they have the final answer, the technology, the power and the strength of production, that they have modernised and rationalised and so on and that they have all the things they think the consumer wants.</P>
    <P>This brings me to marketing, which was also referred to by Deputy Deasy. Marketing in this country in terms of the agriculture and food market is almost non-existent.  In many cases producers and processors are presenting products in exactly the same form as they did 20 to 25 years ago.  There are a couple of honourable exceptions, but one can buy the same type of cheeses off the shelves in supermarkets as one could 25 years ago.  Things are different in supermarkets in Bonn, Berlin or Paris and these people have used time, energy and money on <Col N="1598" /> research and development having tested consumer reaction to products.  As a result of testing the market, as a result of research and development, they have found a niche for themselves and have sold their products.  We have been side stepped all the time in that area.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting one of my colleagues criticised Bord Bainne as being ineffective in terms of marketing, and perhaps there is some blame there, but we have failed badly in the area of producing a product for the convenience of consumers.  The Minister should take hold of the industry by the scruff of the neck and he should recognise that eliminating research and development will not serve a useful purpose.  We need to spend more on marketing and market research.  Products produced here should target the consumer in a way that is a direct response to the consumer's wishes. If we do not do that we will be left on the side line.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Common Agricultural Policy reform, which is a forerunner to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, I was delighted to hear the Minister's trenchant tone.  I hope he will continue in this way because, throughout the country, farmers and PAYE workers associated with agriculture have become dismayed at the lack of response and the lack of belligerence on the part of Irish negotiators in discussions which fundamentally affect their future.  For some reason beyond their comprehension, the farmers and workers feel that our representatives are not fully aware of the necessity to keep a steadfast line in terms of the interests of their own people and to recognise the importance of the industry as far as employment here is concerned.</P>
    <P>Some years ago some people talked about how good things were on the farm, how life was great there and so on. However, things have changed because the flight from the land was never greater. This is because the quality of life is better elsewhere.</P>
    <P>One would think there was a competition to see who can clear more people from the land most quickly on the <Col N="1599" /> premise that there will be greater efficiency in agriculture and the economy will boom.  It may improve things, but more people will be unemployed.  While it might be a great idea to take people off the land and make things more efficient, it is not such a great idea to put more people on the dole queues, as is happening.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the beef tribunal. It is sad that so much time and energy must be expended to tackle problems which have arisen over a period.  I hope the tribunal addresses all the problems so that there will be no need for further similar inquiries.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy McCartan's suggestion that all such hearings should be held in the full glare of publicity such as we have seen across the Atlantic in a case totally unassociated with this.  That could be done if courts and tribunals were there to titillate and entertain the public. If they are to tackle serious problems they should do it efficiently and confidentially and have regard to the freedom, lives and interests of the people involved who have private lives.  I would be critical of holding tribunals or inquiries in like fashion to what we observed of the recent trial across the Atlantic on various television channels.  That does nothing for credibility or for greater confidence in our institutions.  It provides people with cheap entertainment by listening to the minor details of other people's lives.</P>
    <P>I hope the expense of the beef tribunal will be money well spent.  I believe that in such cases there is only one winner, the legal profession.  I mean no disrespect to the legal profession.  Many of my family and friends are stalwart members of the legal profession.  However, I worry at the number of TV shots of eminent legal eagles trotting to and fro because I fear that every time they appear on television it has cost the taxpayer £250,000.</P>
    <P>The general public know that inquiries are necessary from time to time but there must be a less expensive way to do things. This Supplementary Estimate provides for £1 million and that means that we will <Col N="1600" /> have full disclosure and identification of all the problems in the industry that were referred to and a resolution to those problems.  I hope that, having spent well over £1 million, that the problems will be solved.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to upset the legal profession, but I should like to recite a short anecdote.  I had occasion to deal with an inter-family dispute involving some property in my constituency.  Some few thousand pounds was involved.  By the time the matter had gone through the legal channels all that was left was £300 or £400.  All the money went on legal costs, as if somebody had worked it all out with a pocket calculator beforehand.</P>
    <P>Agriculture does not need handouts. Handouts have killed this country.  We need handouts from the EC like a hole in the head.  What we need from the EC is equal opportunity to produce, get to the market and have a fair share of that market.  If we do not get that we are wasting our time.  The Minister is new in office and he should be able to say that he does not accept anything agreed before his term and that he wants a new agreement.  I ask him to do that.  I also ask him to speed up the payment of beef premiums in County Kildare and to do something about the number who were refused this year as compared to any other year &mdash; 90 were refused this year, three last year and one the year before.</P>
    <P>My final point is in regard to environmental protection.  The necessary moneys must be made available to those in the agricultural sector who are willing and anxious to protect the environment. Will the Minister please ensure that those moneys will continue to be made available?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I am opposing this Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister referred to Common Agricultural Policy reform.  I note with regret that he, like his predecessors, is failing to face up to the reality of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Surely it must be clear to everyone in the House that in our frantic efforts to hold on to as much of the <Col N="1601" /> Common Agricultural Policy as possible we are clutching at straws.</P>
      <P>The Green Party also have problems with the MacSharry proposals.  Our problem is that the Common Agricultural Policy reform does not go far enough. However, we would welcome them as an interim measure to bring some order and sanity into the agriculture and food sectors. The urban taxpayers of the EC cannot subsidise indefinitely an inefficient system of agriculture which costs EC taxpayers and Irish consumers too much to produce products which nobody wants and which in many cases are dangerous for human consumption owing to the excessive use of artificial fertilisers which in turn contribute substantially to the pollution of our rivers and streams.  It is hard to imagine a more lethal cocktail.</P>
      <P>I accept, however, that Irish agriculture needs financial support from the EC and this is clearly recognised in the MacSharry proposals.  What we should be aiming for is a system which benefits small and medium sized farmers rather than the large ranchers who at present benefit from extensive milk quotas and the sales of beef into intervention.  What is clearly needed is an income support system to maintain as many people as possible on the land.  Clearly the present Common Agricultural Policy system does not do that.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that the party to which the Minister belongs have as one of their aims the sentiments expressed in Article 45.2.7. of Bunreacht na héireann which states:</P>
      <P>That there may be established on the land in economic security as many families as in the circumstances shall be practicable.</P>
      <P>I ask the Members of the House to reflect on this noble aspiration and to draw their own conclusions as to whether this Government, or previous Governments within living memory have made the slightest effort to comply with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers gaining their livelihood from agriculture have been declining annually for many years and will continue to decline unless there are radical reforms <Col N="1602" /> in this area.  The question of agricultural economics, again, points to the advantage that would be gained by having a basic income scheme for all our citizens. This would be particularly appropriate in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the GATT negotiations, the proposals contained in the Uruguay Round have negative connotations for the world environment as they provide for the continuation of chemical based farming which has been responsible for so much environmental degradation, both here and throughout the world, and the production of food which can be dangerous to eat.  This is the same policy which is responsible for the wholesale destruction of the Amazonian rain forests in the interests of large multinational companies and the international banks.  Our Government should strongly oppose these aspects of the Uruguay Round.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to provide £1.1 million to meet the initial cost of the beef tribunal &mdash; please note the word &ldquo;initial&rdquo;. The final cost of the tribunal, no doubt, will run into millions of pounds of taxpayers' money to feed the already adequately fed legal profession.  It seems that this tribunal will continue well into the New Year, possibly up to Easter. While the tribunal is necessary, the legal fees involved will be astronomical.  Once again I want to put on the record my disgust at the extremely high level of barristers' fees in this type of inquiry.</P>
    <P>It should be realised that ewe headage payments are made to prop up a system which is clearly unsustainable.  There is much ecological evidence of gross overstocking of many mountain areas in the west of Ireland and this is having a disastrous effect on the ecology of the area and has led to the denuding of vegetation cover resulting in increased land slips and the carrying away of topsoil.  In addition, it involves serious cruelty to the ewes as many of them are dying as a result of insufficient grazing.  What is wanted is headage payments for people not for sheep.</P>
    <P>Under subhead L £2.9 million is being <Col N="1603" /> provided for extra farm investment.  I wonder how much of this will be used to prop up the agri-business sector and those farmers who have adopted intensive methods of agriculture, particularly in the pig and poultry sector.</P>
    <P>This is not often referred to in the House but it has to be said: many practices in this area are extremely cruel and represent a greater degree of cruelty to the animals involved than keeping large animals in zoos or to hares in coursing. These are fashionable issues which we, in the Green Party, take on but they pale into insignificance compared with the millions of farm animals who live in cruel and degrading conditions.  This issue needs to be addressed very urgently.</P>
    <P>The agricultural industry has many positive sides.  The side the Green Party would like to push is the organic farming sector.  It is fair to say that up to about four or five years ago organic farming was regarded as a bit of a joke but that is no longer the case.  It is becoming big business.  Indeed, it is amazing the number of farmers who have switched to organic or semi-organic farming during the past two or three years without any financial incentives to do so, in spite of the apparent short term financial problems involved.</P>
    <P>There is a vast market for good quality food which can only be produced by organic methods.  It is very hard to get organic food in shops and supermarkets because it is marketed in a very haphazard way.  Indeed there is an enormous market for this food in Europe.  We know how heavily polluted the soil is on the continent.  For example, in Holland the soil is so badly polluted farmers trying to produce food organically have found their produce contained unacceptable levels of chemicals.  In other words, Holland is just one vast land of poison, and the Dutch are not at all amused.  If they can get it, they will buy organic food produced in this country.  Indeed, one of the reasons people from continental Europe come here is that they know they will be able to eat clean food again although they are not always lucky.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their comments and extending a welcome to me.  All that I can say is that I will do my best and will make every effort in what is currently a difficult area.</P>
      <P>Let me respond first to the points made by Deputy Garland who does not seem to grasp what is involved under the Common Agricultural Policy and just how important it is for the economic well being of people in Ireland.  Deputy Deasy and others made the point very strongly that it would be disastrous, not only for Irish farmers and producers but for the Community, if we returned to the policy of nationalisation.</P>
      <P>One of our major tasks is to keep as many people as possible on the land.  In this context, I see many new opportunities, given the doubling of Structural Funds, developments at Maastricht and the proposed alternative measures.  The alternative measures in the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals are considered to be separate to the major proposals.  Because of this people are inclined to regard them as a sweetener.  I made the point trenchantly in the discussions which took place at the Council on a number of sectors, including the alternative measures, that this issue was far more important than they realised. No matter how well we do in the negotiations on Common Agricultural Policy reform and the GATT negotiations, more people are going to leave the land.  I am aware that only 50 per cent of farmers derive their full income from the farm. The rest of their activity is off-farm activity which supplements their farm income.  That has become necessary and there is nothing wrong with it provided it keeps people in the countryside and maintains the rural population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these schemes, whether it be the Leader Programme, which has great possibilities in that regard, the rural development schemes or the alternative measures which are proposed, are vital and there must be substantial funds for them.  You cannot say that because changes are taking place &mdash; greater competition, new circumstances arising, <Col N="1605" /> more efficient production and higher output &mdash; we do not need as many farmers. Agriculture is very important to us in Ireland and we need good alternatives, of which there are many, including the crops and other products Deputy Durkan mentioned.  There is much talk, for example about the development of the mushroom industry which is worth £45 million now.  In the early sixties I was head of the National Glasshouse and Mushroom Research Unit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot comment on that matter at the moment but the Deputy need not be too concerned about it.  I will come back to that later, but these are matters for the board in the first instance. People comment on the success of the mushroom industry, but that could also be the case with a whole range of other products and commodities.  There is a great need to tackle marketing and we will do so realistically with the knowledge and the competence we have developed. In the sixties there was not much competence in that area.  It was great to be able to develop Dairygold and excellent work was done in that regard but we were limited as far as marketing was concerned. What we must do is look at all the alternative products and market them properly.  Deputies are correct in that if we are to develop those products research must be carried out.  It is not possible to develop new markets without research and appropriate advice and technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had negotiations recently with the Iranians and succeeded in again opening up the market there.  However a number of elements were involved: political, diplomatic, trade and technological elements.  If we cannot satisfy people as regards technology, which is of the highest standard, we are wasting our time trying to satisfy them politically, diplomatically and from the point of view of trade.  Unless we concentrate on all these <Col N="1606" /> elements we will not succeed in developing our products and creating extra jobs. As Deputies said this morning, it is most important that we take action in this area, and I certainly hope to do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy was particularly concerned that the various measures that exist for Common Agricultural Policy reform and the measures that will be introduced as a result of the GATT negotiations will not be permanent.  There will be a lot of debate about the &ldquo;green box&rdquo;. There is also a &ldquo;yellow box&rdquo; but I will not confuse the House by talking about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;green box&rdquo; is crucial to development.  We will negotiate as best we can but at the end of the day, whatever package is agreed must go into the permanent &ldquo;green box&rdquo; which will be exempt from future GATT disciplines. That is the <i>sine qua non</i> of this measure, and there is an increasing understanding of that reality in the US.  There is an argument that they want some of their measures included in the green box, but that will depend on what is involved.  If the measures are equivalent to ours it would be hard to say that they should not be included but it is a matter of eligibility, and I can assure Deputy Durkan that there will be suitable forms for this.  That is the way the matter will have to be addressed at an international level, and these debates are going on as part of the GATT discussions.  I want to assure Deputy Deasy that it is a matter of which we are very conscious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy seemed to be concerned that nations such as Germany in particular, with all the problems they face, will be less interested in sharing our problems or working with us in trying to find solutions for the Community as a whole. That is not my experience of dealing with the Germans.  I had a bilateral meeting and dinner with them very late on Wednesday night last.  It was an excellent discussion and they are very anxious to <Col N="1607" /> know our requirements and to consider them in the context of theirs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland spoke about an income support system for everybody and said the people would be happy with that but Deputy Durkan pointed to the great dangers of such a system not only in the short term but also in the long term.  The Germans take the view more so than we do that a substantial proportion of the money should come directly from the marketplace.  If the system does not provide for that it will not be durable in the long term.  I mentioned that point in my speech.  We differ from the Germans in various respects but they support us in some of our difficulties. I assure Deputy Deasy &mdash; and Deputy Durkan can draw this to his attention since he has had to leave the House &mdash; that there is still great cohesion among the Agriculture Ministers in relation to these problems even though there are differences in the requirements of the various states.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy also emphasised the need for marketing, research and development and education, particularly for young farmers.  In this country 50 per cent of our farmers are over 55 years of age and therefore we are very interested in the pre-retirement arrangements under the alternative measures.  People in Europe who take a logical view of that would be inclined to say that this measure should apply specifically to those groups and that we should not apply for assistance for young people.  However, we want to keep young people in agriculture and we need more flexible arrangements in relation to quotas and so on.  Therefore just as it is necessary to have the pre-retirement arrangement it is also necessary that arrangements be agreed for our young people.  The Deputy can take it that I have noted his comments and I will be pursuing the matter.  Teagasc has been mentioned by Deputy Deasy, Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Durkan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Health (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £50,438,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1991, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that office, including grants to health boards, miscellaneous grants, and a grant-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 February 1991, my predecessor Deputy O'Hanlon outlined to the House the Government's policy regarding the management of the health services in 1991.  The policy, as outlined in February, <Col N="1609" /> was based on a number of key principles, including: the maintenance of services at a level not less than that which was approved in respect of 1990; the provision of assistance to health boards in meeting the cost of demand-led schemes where these proved to be higher than initially anticipated; and the pursuit, by health agencies, of all possible opportunities to maximise the use of available resources prior to the consideration of additional funding.  We remain committed to those principles.</P>
    <P>Given the current economic situation it is vital that all sectors of the public service contribute to the containment of expenditure at levels consistent with our economic targets.  To this end, a package of corrective measures was introduced in July of this year.  This Supplementary Estimate is net of savings achieved as a result of that package of measures. Despite the acute pressure on the public finances the Government are honouring fully the commitment which they made in relation to the funding of the health services in 1991.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer briefly to the main elements of the Estimate before the House.  This year, for the first time, the cost of all the schemes, generally regarded as demand-led, has been included in one subhead of the Health Vote-subhead G.2.  This subhead provides for expenditure on: disabled person's (maintenance) allowance; disabled person's (rehabilitation) allowance; capitation fees to vocational rehabilitation centres; mobility allowance for handicapped persons; infectious disease (maintenance) allowances; blind welfare allowances; long term illness scheme; drug refund schemes; domiciliary care allowances for handicapped children, and maternity cash grants.</P>
    <P>The boards are statutorily compelled to meet the costs incurred by every person who establishes eligibility under the various schemes.  In addition, changes in the manner in which eligibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance is assessed coupled with the changes in the social welfare code have led to an escalation in the cost of this scheme. <Col N="1610" /> These schemes have, therefore, put a lot of pressure on the resources of health boards.</P>
    <P>Expenditure under the disabled person's maintenance allowance has increased due to an increase in the number of recipients.  This has arisen mainly from the introduction of the equality legislation in 1989 and the outcome of the Healy case which established the right of spouses to claim the allowance in their own right.  The effect of these combined, has resulted in a greater number of spouses claiming DPMA both at the full and reduced rates.  The number in receipt of this allowance has increased by some 5 per cent over 1990 levels.</P>
    <P>Prescribing trends in the drug schemes have shown an upward trend during 1991 resulting in higher than anticipated costs in these schemes, notwithstanding savings which have been achieved through changes in the drug refund scheme.  The expenditure trend of the long term illness scheme has been influenced by the drug prescribing patterns evident in the general medical services scheme.  While the number of persons covered has increased by some 3 per cent to about 47,000 persons, the main factor responsible for the increase in the cost of this scheme is the increase in the cost mix of drugs prescribed, from less expensive items to newer, more costly, items.</P>
    <P>The drug refund scheme has been affected in a similar way by a change in the drug prescribing mix.  In addition, the drug cost subsidisation scheme, which was introduced in 1990 to alleviate the circumstances of patients requiring medication for an extended period, now covers some 19,500 persons compared with 12,000 on commencement of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Because of the increased expenditure on these schemes and to make provision for the bonus payments in December, an additional provision of £8.6 million is being made available to health boards.  I am pleased to be in a position to provide this assistance to the health boards, thus avoiding the need for health boards to reduce expenditure on other services in <Col N="1611" /> order to meet these costs.  This is a significant development in the arrangements for the funding of health boards and eliminates one of the major budgetary uncertainties which have affected the boards in recent years.</P>
    <P>A feature of modern health care is the increase in the range and scope of medical conditions amenable to treatment. A number of these treatments are highly specialised and it is not always feasible to provide them in this country. We are continuing to support hospitals in keeping abreast of medical developments, as in the case of liver transplants. Nevertheless, the need to send patients abroad to receive specialised medical care has increased considerably in recent years, although the overall numbers are still relatively small.  An additional provision of £1.3 million is being made available in order to meet the costs incurred in 1991.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, following a series of discussions with the Irish Haemophilia Society regarding the plight of those haemophiliacs who had contracted the HIV virus, the Government decided to provide further financial assistance for haemophiliacs. The House will recall that a sum of £1 million was allocated by the Government in 1989 and this sum was disbursed to individuals and their dependants through the HIV-haemophiliac trust.</P>
    <P>This year the Government approved the provision of further assistance of £8 million.  Certain aspects of the Government offer required to be cleared by the High Court.  This has now been done and I am pleased that, as agreed with the Haemophilia Society, the first payments are being made this week.  The balance is due to be paid early in 1992.  A total of 102 persons and/or their dependants will benefit from the settlement.  Under the arrangements agreed with the Irish Haemophilia Society and its legal advisers, the £2 million to be paid this year, which is provided for in this Estimate, will be divided equally among the claimants. The balance of £6 million will be paid early next year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> This Estimate makes a provision of £1.5 million from lottery funds in respect of capital expenditure on essential equipment replacement.  It will be used to fund a range of top priority items, including the provision of a replacement cobalt unit and major X-ray equipment at Cork Regional Hospital.  Following the failure of the cobalt unit at Cork Regional Hospital earlier this year, it was necessary to make immediate arrangements for the ongoing treatment of some Cork patients at St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin. Arrangements are currently in place for the provision of this specialised treatment and additional funding will be available to cover the cost to St. Luke's.  The commissioning of the new cobalt unit in Cork will bring a welcome end to this necessary but somewhat difficult arrangement for patients from Cork.  I am, of course, very grateful to the staff of St. Luke's for the care and dedicated attention given to those patients.  The capital provision in this Estimate will also be used to fund the purchase of operating theatre and anaesthetic equipment in a number of hospitals.  I am very much aware of the need for additional funds for the purchase of new and replacement equipment and I hope to reflect these priorities in the allocation of capital in 1992 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>An amount of £17 million is included in the Supplementary Estimate to meet the additional expenditure of the general medical services scheme.  This will bring the provision made for this purpose in 1991 to £172.712 million.  This compares with an initial provision of £155.7 million.</P>
    <P>The major contributory factor to the increase has been the continuing escalation in the cost of drugs prescribed.  The cost of drugs has continued to increase, despite the price reductions which resulted from the agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, negotiated in August 1990.  The major cause of this increase in costs is the prescribing of newer, more expensive drugs, rather than an increase in the volume. There are several reasons for the increase, including accelerating advances in treatment therapies and the diffusion <Col N="1613" /> of sophisticated drugs and medicines from tertiary hospitals into the community. Despite this trend, we are still relatively low prescribers when compared with other EC countries, but we must continue to identify and realise opportunities for savings in the total drugs bill.  In the February review of the GMS scheme several of those opportunities were identified and they are now being implemented.</P>
    <P>The National Therapeutics Advisory Committee have been established, a particularly important initiative.  The committee, representative of hospital doctors, hospital pharmacists, general practitioners, community pharmacists and management, are charged with examining all factors involved in influencing prescribing; advising on mechanisms to bring about greater co-ordination and offering professional advise to doctors on cost-effective prescribing. I ask everybody involved to work together to make the best use of the resources available.  The Government are considering other initiatives in that respect.</P>
    <P>The major commitment given by my predecessor on behalf of the Government last February related to the maintenance of services in acute hospitals at the level approved in respect of 1990.</P>
    <P>The additional provision being made in this Estimate for acute hospital services is £15.458 million, which is made up of the £7.713 million contained in subheads G.1 and G.4 and the freeing up of £7.745 million in subhead G.1 as a result of the provision of additional lottery funds under subhead G.9.  The health boards and hospitals have been able to maintain their bed levels, as I said earlier in reply to a Dáil question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Work on the new hospital in Waterford commenced in 1987 and is due for completion in 1993.  I would love to dwell on this rather good subject.  Improvements have been effected in Waterford, Wexford, the Mater Hospital in Dublin and work is under way at the Rotunda Hospital.  In south Dublin in 1991 phase 1C of the development at St. James's Hospital was commissioning.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Mid-Western Health Board, resources were made available to enable the planning of much-needed developments at Limerick General Hospital and appointments to Ennis General Hospital.  Provision has been made for the development of a consultant-led geriatric service and the accident and emergency and physiotherapy services at Ennis have also been improved.</P>
      <P>Members will notice the modesty of the Midland Health Board.  In August of this year approval issued to the Midland Health Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In this short review of acute hospital services in 1991 it is appropriate to refer to the work of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, chaired by Professor Kennedy.  The House is well aware of the <Col N="1615" /> group's excellent work and the various reports they issued.  There were three reports: the first report contained a series of recommendations in relation to the implementation of &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;; the second report dealt with the organisational structures in Dublin and the third report dealt with out-patient services, the management of in-patient waiting lists, referrals of patients and geriatric services.</P>
    <P>Professor Kennedy was subsequently invited to chair a new advisory group, who have already met and who will oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group in relation to acute hospital service issues, particularly regarding out-patients and waiting lists. The group will also advise me on other matters relating to the future development of hospital services in the Dublin region.  I am very pleased indeed that the group have been set up and have held their inaugural meeting.  I thank them for agreeing to act and I wish to keep in touch with them in relation to their various reports.  I pay tribute to them for the work they have done.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides £170,000 for consultancy services.  That expenditure arises in the finalisation of the work on hospital efficiency which concentrated on hospitals in Dublin and Cork.  The recommendations made in the report are being implemented through a high level steering group with the assistance of the consultants who prepared the report.</P>
    <P>Particular emphasis has been placed this year on the necessity for health agencies to achieve greater value for money individually and collectively.  I am glad to be able to inform the House that the health boards and hospitals have responded very positively to the initiative. The concept of value for money now forms an inherent part of the management culture of the health services.</P>
    <P>The steering group established by my predecessor are continuing to work closely with hospitals and will also work closely with the recently established Mercy/Charity Healthcare Company, <Col N="1616" /> and I am satisfied that in general this co-operation and collaboration will continue to move forward in this sphere.</P>
    <P>The health board value-for-money coordinating committee established earlier this year have met on a regular basis. They aim to achieve better purchasing power in many fashions and I understand that the purchasing performance of health boards is improving.  The committee will continue to receive the support of the Department.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that the concept of collective action has been adopted by the Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services for People with a Mental Handicap through the establishment of a pilot study group comprising four organisations.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border co-operation continues to be a priority in our efforts to maximise efficiency through collective action.  A series of initiatives is being pursued with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, notably in the area of equipment purchase. That is a very interesting development. I know my predecessor, Deputy O'Hanlon, enjoyed a fine relationship with his opposite number in the North of Ireland.  I have heard from Mr. Jeremy Hanley and hope to meet him shortly. When I held the Education portfolio I enjoyed a similar relationship with Dr. Mawhinney and later with Lord Belstead.  In the wider political sense and in the narrow health sense, it is very important that the contacts and ties continue.</P>
    <P>The lottery provision is being increased by £9.745 million.  As I already explained, £7.745 million of this amount enables my Department to free up an equivalent amount under subhead G1 towards the cost of acute hospital services under health boards.  It does not mean that there are additional funds now available in 1991 for grants to voluntary welfare agencies.  It is a substitution of lottery for Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>In addition, £2 million is being provided from the lottery in respect of payments to be made to haemophiliacs.  I have already dealt with that matter.</P>
    <P>The Estimate also includes a provision <Col N="1617" /> of £4.5 million in respect of a shortfall in appropriations-in-aid of the Health Vote which results from a lower than anticipated level of receipts from health contributions. This does not, of course, increase the gross level of expenditure which can be incurred under the Health Vote in 1991.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to recommend the Estimate to the House.  It is clear evidence of the Government's determination to meet fully the commitments made to the health services and to cope with the difficulties which have arisen for the services during 1991.  I know that it has been a difficult year for those managing and delivering the services and I hope they will see in the Estimate a very clear expression of the good will and concern which informs the Government's policy in relation to the health services.</P>
    <P>Although I have had occasion to deal with health matters in Private Members' Business and replied to Dáil Questions in relation to the Health portfolio, on this formal occasion I pay tribute to my predecessor, Deputy O'Hanlon, for his four years and eight months' dedication to the cause of health, for the service he gave the country and for his commitment to the provision of high quality health services.</P>
    <P>I should now like to speak briefly on one other matter, although it does not exactly form part of the Estimate.  Since the beginning of September, as the House will know, the accident and emergency services in the six main Dublin hospitals have been operating under a rota system whereby each hospital is off call after 5 p.m. for one week in every three.  At the introduction of the new rota a firm commitment was given that the effects of the new arrangements would be monitored closely by my Department in consultation with the Eastern Health Board steering group on the accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>This steering group is made up of the chief executives of the hospitals concerned and their accident and emergency consultants.  A detailed report on the operation of the new rota has been submitted recently with the unanimous <Col N="1618" /> recommendation that all six hospitals revert to the 24-hour on-call arrangement because of the difficulties that have emerged under the new rota.  The group have stated that while overall activity levels were maintained, difficulties emerged in maintaining satisfactory levels of service because of peaks in attendance during the on-call weeks.  Furthermore, elective, that is planned, hospital admissions and out-patient clinics have been affected in hospitals during their on-call weeks.  In the light of the experience of the arrangements introduced in September 1991, the Government have decided that there should be a reversal to a 24-hour on-call arrangement for all six hospitals.  My Department will be meeting the six hospitals to discuss their service plans and priorities having regard to their financial allocations for 1992.  Of course, the hospitals will be required to live within their overall allocations for 1992 and, in this context, they will have to address the relative priority and balance between their emergency services and the level of the other services they will provide.  I will be asking the Eastern Health Board Steering Group, to which I have referred already, to review the operation of the revised accident and emergency arrangements and to report to me at the end of March.</P>
    <P>I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is her first formal Estimate I should like to welcome the new Minister to her office.  However, if she were to ask today how we are doing in the Department of Health, I am afraid I would have to say that the present year she is reviewing has been one of disastrous mismanagement by Government of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a year in which the Government have lost their grip on the management of this crucial sector.  One need only revert to the January budget when the then Minister, despite the protestations of all of the health agencies under his charge that they did not have sufficient money to keep their basic services going, denied that that was the case and insisted <Col N="1619" /> on under-budgeting the services.  As predicted, by July the health budget had gone completely off the rails and the Government then reponded with a completely reckless programme of retrenchment.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that the Government launched an illegal dawn raid on £3 million from subscribers to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, virtually dismantled the drug refund scheme, as a consequence of which many low income families who sustained an illness found they would have to spend up to £180 on drugs without any refund of those costs. In effect, this scheme not only created hardship but deepened the poverty trap about which the Government so frequently say they are endeavouring to do something.</P>
    <P>The worst decision of all was their mindless policy of closing two of Dublin's major hospital casualty departments every night.  I am glad to note that the present Minister finally acknowledges this was a disastrous decision that did not save any money and brought admissions in Dublin hospitals to a virtual standstill.</P>
    <P>I would have to say to the Minister that it is serious when her Minister of State came into the House not one month ago and assured the House that elective admissions were up, that everything was running well as a result of that change. To treat Members of the House to that sort of padding and misleading information is just foolishness on the part of the Department and the Minister of State.  We are not children; we know the problems.  If one is taking a new approach to health the first thing one should do is have a little honesty with people as to what is happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are two flatly conflicting statements on the part of two members of the Government.</P>
      <P>I should like now to pass on to the present position in the Department and their approach to the management of these services.  It is very disappointing that the Department appear to have lost any real knowledge of what is taking place in the services themselves.  I have tabled a series of parliamentary questions to the Minister's Department: for example, seeking the number on waiting lists, when the Department were unable to provide that information; whether the Department would outline the level of capital spending on facilities for those with a mental and physical handicap, when the Department were unable to outline the information; a question about the capital projects assisted from the 1991 public capital programme, the projected cost, the allocations made, asking what work remained to be done on these projects, when the Department were unable to provide the information.  Again, I sought information on waiting lists classified in different procedures when the Department were unable to provide the information.  Another had to do with one of the big issues facing our health services at present, that of medical liability, when the Department were unable to provide the relevant information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is becoming a growing feature of Departmental attitude to parliamentary questions in this House, it is a very disturbing one.  I wonder whether it is that the Department do not know or do not want to let on because earlier this year the Government were willing to indicate detailed figures with regard to waiting lists.  In April I recall they indicated a number of 1,700 people awaiting hip replacements, 2,500 awaiting tonsillectomies, 3,000 for cataract operations, 1,000 for heart by-pass operations, all hard figures we were able to debate in the House.  Now the Government will not provide those figures.  The reality is that the Department are shying <Col N="1622" /> away from the financial and service realities created as a result of the 1991 budget.</P>
    <P>What has happened in real terms in 1991 is that the health boards and agencies under the Minister's control were given an extra £40 million, that is the health boards and various voluntary hospitals, to run their services.  They had absolutely no chance of maintaining their services with that sum.  For a start they were committed to normal pay increases to their staff of £45 million &mdash; that was an increase in pay they had to meet which alone would have absorbed all of their allocation &mdash; but, in addition, they were committed to £30 million in special pay increases.  Before one even begins to allow for the rising costs elsewhere in their non-pay elements, the health boards and agencies were down by a sum of £35 million.  That was a real cut in their services provision of 5 per cent.  It is no wonder we are seeing growing waiting lists, the special care institutions with growing lists, the community health services being subjected to increased strain with no opportunity or possibility of developing these to meet the rapidly emerging needs such as the AIDS crisis.</P>
    <P>Those are the hard facts the Government have attempted to conceal.  For example, the Government announced they would maintain the level of services in hospitals but when one examined what they meant it transpired that what they meant was that they would keep on paper 12,000 beds in the system.  They ignored the fact that prolonged seasonal closures were to be a feature in all those health agencies.  Those prolonged seasonal closures reduced the ability of hospitals to deal with their elective waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I will take just one example, that of the Mid-Western Health Board which, in the second half of this year, took out of their system 10,500 patient days, thus increasing their waiting lists &mdash; giving that the average hospital stay is five or six day &mdash; by approximately 2,000 patients. That is in one of the shortest lists where the waiting time for hip replacement is two and a half years.  The same is true of every other health board.  These <Col N="1623" /> waiting lists are often being concealed. People who want an assessment for surgery have to wait longer and longer before they can see a consultant and have the possibility of joining the end of a waiting list.</P>
    <P>The Government have repeated year after year that they are committed to providing resources to develop community care.  They have not done so this year.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> refers to real increases in spending of £90 million over the next seven years and a gradual shift of resources from in-patient institutions to community services.  The year 1991 saw a real decline of £25 million in the provision for community care, a dramatic reversal from the target.  Contrary to the Government commitment we saw a decline in the share of health spending going to community services as against acute hospital services.</P>
    <P>That is the reason that a growing number of persons with mental handicap are in urgent need of residential placement. The list in the Eastern Health Board area has grown by 50 per cent in less than a year.  Carers rightly feel neglected and bitter at the failure to provide resources.  They have to provide care day after day, well beyond normal breaking point.  There are literally thousands who have been deemed in need of residential care which is not available for them.</P>
    <P>The voluntary agencies have been badly treated this year.  Not only have their budgets been cut but the health boards have adopted the practice of delaying payment of their cheques for up to six months.  This puts a huge strain on voluntary agencies and on suppliers, who face the same delay.  The consequence is that next year suppliers when tendering will build into their estimates substantial increases because they know they will not be paid for six months.  It is storing up a problem for the coming year.  The national lottery has sucked £50 million out the budgets of voluntary agencies by depriving them of their fund raising capacity and it has put back a mere £3 <Col N="1624" /> million.  It is idle to talk of charters for these voluntary agencies when this is their experience.</P>
    <P>During the election campaign in 1989 the scales finally fell from the Taoiseach's eyes with regard to the crisis in the health services.  The same message is waiting for him and for the Minister if they care to listen.  A very insidious development in the way we are funding our health service is the notion of special allocations from the national lottery.  The health boards have been bearing real cuts for a number of years in their overall provision but then on budget day a few million pounds is given by way of special allocation. These sums do not go a tiny fraction of the way to honour commitments made or to compensate for the cuts.  The Government are trying to get praise by splitting the cuts and making a small allocation after the budget.  Far worse is that the health agencies cannot plan on the basis of these sorts of allocations because they do not know from year to year if they will continue.  They are trying to develop a long term plan which will see a gradual build up in community care, but that is not possible under these special allocations. It conflicts with good management of our health services.</P>
    <P>Another foolish decision this year was the extension of care to the top 15 per cent of income earners.  These people never asked for public care.  It was really an effort to get an extra £20 million in health contributions but it did not contribute to a better health service.  It would have been much better to concentrate on the existing public waiting lists.  It was a shame that the Government took this decision.  It involved this House in much needless debate which did not get to grips with the problems of people waiting for cataract operations, hip replacements and cardiac surgery.  It was a hollow gesture which did nothing for the health services.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department have been very strong on rhetoric and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> made pleasant noises about the way our health services should develop.  I said in a debate earlier this week that it took <Col N="1625" /> only seven days for the Government to renege on the commitment to persons with disability set out in that document. All those other commitments are gradually unravelling.  Nurses, particularly those employed on a temporary or part-time basis, have been expecting some recognition of their services.  They went to the Labour Court and got a commitment that they would be given recognition and an opportunity for some sort of incremental scale which would give credit for their skill and experience.  Now the Government are trying to talk them down.  The nursing staff are in the front line trying to deliver services to patients, often in very difficult conditions.  It will be a retrograde step if they have to suffer a cutback in their income, which is often very small.  They are among the low paid in the health services who are having to bear the brunt.</P>
    <P>The Minister remarked that drug costs are out of control.  The Government budgeted for a £7 million drop in the drugs bill in the GMS and in the drug refund scheme but there was no coherent policy underlying it.  It is not surprising that huge sums have to be put into the GMS to compensate for the foolish undertaking in the original Estimate to bring about dramatic cuts.  There was no policy to achieve it.  We must consider the fact that drug companies are spending £35 million promoting their products. There is the place to start making savings. That money is not getting through to any patients and it is probably encouraging doctors to prescribe drugs in the most recent brochures.</P>
    <P>This has not been a good year for the health services and the outlook for the coming year is probably worse.  Deputy Rabbitte will probably speak about the problems in Tallaght where the long suffering people are waiting for their hospital.  That is a typical example of our problems.  I hope the Minister will take her Department by the scruff of the neck and institute a better management system and a much improved delivery of services to people who wish her well in her job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party are <Col N="1626" /> opposed to this Supplementary Estimate because we do not believe it is sufficient to meet the increasing, legitimate and proven demands of the health services.</P>
      <P>In the debate on the motion put down by Fine Gael last week I maintained that the area of disability has been shamefully neglected by the Government and I said the Minister for Health should make it a priority to remedy this situation.  I have some confidence that the Minister can and will improve the position of handicapped people.  In order to do this the Government should increase the resources available in the forthcoming Estimates and next year's budget to implement the recommendations in the report entitled <i>Needs and Abilities</i> which is at present before the Minister.  I also said they should provide the minimum capital and revenue resources to meet the needs which have been identified in that report, together with additional resources to make up the shortfall in funding in 1990 and 1991.  This shortfall has not been taken into account in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party have identified that over the three years starting in 1992 the Minister will need approximately £12.7 million in capital funding and approximately £15.9 million in current funding for mental handicap alone.  As I said in the debate I mentioned earlier, the major agencies involved in the provision of services for people with a mental handicap &mdash; I will communicate the names of the agencies to the Minister &mdash; are practically bankrupt and will be seeking urgent meetings with the Minister.  I understand from reliable sources that one of these agencies is located in the Dublin area while another works in the western and midland area.  These agencies have to deal with a major crisis in funding and are virtually unable to meet their day to day liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acute financial difficulties experienced by these agencies have been caused by a starvation of funding from the Department of Health, and indirectly by the Department of Finance and the Government.  Each year since 1987 these agencies have been subjected to more <Col N="1627" /> and more cutbacks.  It has now reached the stage where most of them can no longer manage to maintain their existing services, let alone meet any increasing demands.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a commitment to maintain services at the agreed 1990 levels.  However, one cannot run a health service based on statistics.  If, for some reason outside our control, there is an epidemic next year and more people need to be hospitalised how will this demand be met if funding is maintained at the 1990 level?  This means that, statistically, people cannot get sick.  How can one run a health service on statistics like that? The Minister admitted that a mistake was made in relation to the major hospital accident services in Beaumont Hospital and other hospitals in Dublin and has reverted to the original arrangement; we asked her to revert to that arrangement and I am glad she is now doing this.</P>
    <P>The position of families who have to care for a person with a mental handicap has greatly deteriorated in recent years, as the report before the Minister graphically demonstrates, there has been a stand still in real budget terms while those with a mental handicap and their families have grown older and their demands more pressing.  The same applies in terms of the services provided by the health board.  As Deputy Bruton said, all the health agencies and programme managers have been in contact with us about this problem.</P>
    <P>There is an article in today's <i>The Cork Examiner</i> written by Eamon Timmins entitled &ldquo;Health Board Shock&rdquo;.  It states that health boards have debts of between £50 million and £60 million over and above the normal deficits in their current accounts.  The problem is so bad that some hospitals have experienced difficulties obtaining the normal deliveries. Small firms in my area rang me to say they are sorry but they cannot supply the hospitals in my area as they are unable to pay their bills.  Normally suppliers like to have contracts with health boards who are regarded as good customers who pay their bills when they became due, but <Col N="1628" /> because health boards are unable to pay their bills, small suppliers are being put under incredible pressure.  These small suppliers are unable to subsidise the cash flow problems of health boards.</P>
    <P>This point was taken up in the article by the chairman of the Small Firms Association, Mr. Faulkner, who said that this practice is unacceptable and unethical. That is an extraordinary statement from a person who is responsible for small firms.  Surely it is unacceptable from the point of view of the State that major agencies have to issue post-dated cheques which may bounce.  This represents gross mismanagement by health boards and the Department of Health from the point of view of patients who at the end of the day, are the people who will suffer.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to waiting lists for essential treatments.  It is sometimes forgotten that the people who get to the top of the queue may find it impossible to get a bed in a hospital.  This problem is getting worse by the day.  It is particularly bad in respect of long-stay patients who need geriatric accommodation. This morning I was contacted by the distraught relative of a person who is being discharged from a district hospital.  As no bed is available for this medical card holder in a geriatric hospital, they are being forced to look for a bed in a private nursing home.  The Minister's predecessor failed to introduce the necessary measure which would enable health boards make payments to private nursing homes to subvent the cost of looking after old people with medical cards who have given a lifetime of service to this country.  Because the State has abdicated its responsibility to these people, their relatives have to go around the country trying to find private nursing homes to take them.</P>
    <P>Hospitals are being forced to cut back on bed linen, cleaning, hygiene, nutrition and heating, all the items which make a stay in hospital a little more bearable. Increasingly patients are put anywhere space can be found for them.  In some cases non-ambulant patients are put in beds on second or third floors of dilapidated buildings.  It is only a matter <Col N="1629" /> of time before these patients are put at extreme risk from fire and other hazards. I hope the Minister will take it upon herself to visit some of these institutions which are starved of cash and cannot meet the requirements laid down by county council fire officers and her Department.</P>
    <P>There is only one reason the proportion of national wealth spent on health care has been reduced every year since Fianna Fáil came into office in 1987; the proportion of national wealth spent on health care is estimated to be approximately 6 per cent but this figure has failed to take account of the significant growth in GDP.  The figure is even smaller now. Since the 1987 election the Government decided to take 4,000 health workers out of the service; introduced charges for services to which people were previously entitled under PRSI; closed 3,000 beds &mdash; 2,000 of which were acute beds, 300 geriatric beds and 700 psychiatric beds &mdash; closed 24 hospitals, some of which were in my health board area and one in my own town, Tipperary &mdash; St. Vincent's Hospital.  That was a tragic decision which had been proposed by Fianna Fáil members of our health board.  They promised to reintroduce an ambulance station but that promise was never fulfilled.</P>
    <P>In a reply to a question the Minister stated that health boards had been given mobile cardiac care units in five or six health board areas but only one was put into operation, in Sligo.  In the south east region one such unit was parked in a shed for two years despite the generosity of the Irish Heart Foundation.  They are the problems we are faced with.  Those statistics are unpleasant but they are facts.  Some of the hospitals that were closed have been put to other use.  I compliment St. Vincent's Hospital, in my constituency, which is now a very useful day care centre.  That is fine but that centre was supposed to be erected on a new site in a new purpose built building before the closure of St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>
    <P>The net effect is that £200 million less has been spent on health in the past few <Col N="1630" /> years.  This Supplementary Estimate will not even cover over the cracks as far as funding the health boards is concerned.  It will not stave off the potential bankruptcy facing many of the health agencies or allow for the heating to be turned up in any of our hospitals as we approach the cold weather.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer is the fact that the medical council have run out of funds and are unable to continue functioning.  To some extent their funds have been exhausted by the long running and very complicated inquiry they are conducting into certain matters in Beaumont Hospital.  They may not even be able to complete that inquiry. The Minister will agree that the medical council are a very important body responsible, ultimately, for professional standards in medicine.  The point has now been reached where the medical council are unable to do their business.  That will result in a crisis in standards which will inevitably be accompanied by a crisis in public confidence.  We do not want that. Against this background one of the most nonsensical and even nauseating provisions in the Supplementary Estimate is that of £170,000 for a so-called hospital efficiency review.  That is being done at a time when the medical council are in difficulty because they are carrying out an investigation into certain matters in Beaumont Hospital.  If one had any relationship with hospital administrators, consultants or matrons who are so committed to the health services one would realise there are very few areas that can be run more efficiently.</P>
    <P>The health services are deteriorating before our eyes.  Our nursing profession have been shamefully treated to a point where the majority of nurses work under conditions of great physical and emotional stress.  In most health boards, and this is well known, nurses have been forced to take unofficial action and work to rule simply because they are unable to cope any longer with the ever-increasing demands made on them.  That resulted from the voluntary redundancy offered to the 4,000 health workers in 1987. Those who remained in the services were <Col N="1631" /> committed to staying.  Because of the inability of health boards to fill vacancies or create jobs in the nursing service, nurses who are left must face extra stress.  That will lead to more difficulties unless the Minister addresses the issue of health funding as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>I compliment the people directly involved in the health services, the nurses and doctors, who are extremely committed and who work under tremendous stress and strain.  This is the level to which the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government have brought our health services.  The Estimate provides for a sum of £40 million from the Exchequer and £10 million from the national lottery which will do little or nothing to alleviate the crisis in our health services.  I have no doubt that, if and when the Government have the courage to publish the Estimates for 1992, we will find that the picture is even more bleak.  We are warned about the doom and gloom of the public finances by every media source, on television, radio and in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to fight within the Cabinet to ensure that her Department are given priority over other Departments. She should not allow further economic stringencies to be placed on her Department.  That is the reason we will be calling a vote on this Estimate.  It is clear that the Government have already forfeited the trust of the Irish people in so many other areas and that was confirmed in last night's television opinion poll.  If that is the case, they cannot be trusted to look after the health of our people.  There is an element of distrust and absolute abdication of any sense of responsibility in health, education, housing and other priority areas.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Estimates honouring commitments given to Tallaght in the past, an area which I had the privilege of visiting with my colleagues, the Minister's predecessor, and the Minister of State.  There is an £8 million hole there which is supposed to represent the start of a new hospital complex to service the wider Tallaght area.  I look forward also to some improvements being carried out <Col N="1632" /> at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny where, because of overcrowding, patients are in the corridors.  That could be taken as an underhanded way of ensuring that we do not appoint more nurses.</P>
    <P>If we saw the level of nursing care in other countries, within and outside the Community, we would be ashamed of what we have done to some of our people and with what the Government have been allowed to get away with.  In February the Minister's predecessor &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; committed himself to additional funding for disabled persons maintenance allowances, drug refunds and other matters.  The problem is that until recently, the Department of Health have failed to reach an agreement with health boards, chief executive officers and chairmen and that has created a cashflow crisis.  The health boards are required by law to pay out funds to people who qualify for disabled persons maintenance allowance, drug refunds and so on.  They have no control over these issues.  We spent eight or nine months arguing with them as to the levels of over expenditure and I am sorry it has created a cashflow crisis which has affected other services and led to a cutback in overtime rates and other problems.</P>
    <P>I will not continue to itemise the problems, but I hope the Minister will continue his commitment to this Department.  This Estimate does not give me any cause for pleasure or reassure me, but I accept that the Minister has not been there long enough to put her stamp on the Department of Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her appointment to the Department of Health.  I do not know if this Ministry is the most difficult chore that faces the Minister in the New Year, but in any event I wish her well in it.</P>
      <P>Before referring to the acute hospitals service I will take up a point made by Deputy Ferris concerning his plea that the traditional neglect of the mental handicap area be addressed by the new Minister.  Every Member of the House will agree that this problem in Irish society has been hidden for too long and that eventually the parents of mentally handicapped people were forced to organise themselves, to go onto the streets, to picket this House, to hold meetings adjacent to this House and meetings in the Mansion House attended by almost 1,000 parents, all with harrowing stories to tell about the neglect of the mentally handicapped in our society. They were forced to do this because of their difficulty in dealing with the health agencies, the Department of Health and successive Ministers for Health.  I will not relate as anecdotal evidence the kind of stories told at those meetings and I am sure the Minister shares the human sympathy that exists for people dealing with these problems, but it is an area where parents have been left to look after their mentally handicapped offspring or relatives without respite every day of the week.  There have been inadequate institutional day relief services and so on.  The problem was exacerbated in my part of the city by the long term scandal of the under utilisation of places in Cheeverstown House.  That problem seems to be nearing a solution now.  It was disgraceful that that facility was only half used for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the general remarks made by Deputies Bruton and Ferris about the under-provision of resources for health services.  I am not arguing that the solution to all our problems in the health service is to throw more money at it, but having regard to the problems that are <Col N="1634" /> again manifesting themselves, especially in the acute hospital services, it is clear that we still have a crisis.  I hope that if we have a general election, and one seems to be imminent, the Taoiseach will not be able to tell the people that he only learned of it during the course of the general election campaign.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the provision to alleviate the problems in the acute hospital service.  Deputies Bruton and Ferris dealt at some length with some of the difficulties, especially the inordinate hardship imposed by the fall back to a rostering system for the accident and emergency services in this city, which was disgraceful.  If the delivery of and access to services in the acute hospital system is serious in the areas dealt with by Deputies Bruton and Ferris, can the Minister imagine what it is like in the part of Dublin which I represent where there is no acute hospital? I cannot see how any Minister for Health could, for example, announce a plan to streamline and reorganise the delivery of services under the aegis of the EHB, create five new district areas, each related to an acute hospital, and here we have a population of almost 250,000 people without an acute hospital.  How one can reorganise the EHB so that a new district health area is supposed to have as its focus an acute general hospital of any kind, I do not know.  When the former Minister announced that plan he did not make any provision and did not explain how it was supposed to function.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the air is thick with rumour and comment on scandals in politics and in business, but there is no scandal to compare with the neglect of the people I represent in west Dublin, north Kildare and west Wicklow.  This is an ongoing saga.  I have the prospectus which was issued at the announcement of the conclusion of the competition for architectural design for the Tallaght Hospital in 1981, ten years ago.  It makes very interesting reading in the context of the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, explaining to the House that the cost of the project is now envisaged to be £118 million.  It <Col N="1635" /> was £64 million according to the document I have in my hand at the time when we were supposed to turn the sod.  The longer we push it into the future the more difficult it will become to climb that mountain.  The helpful prospectus was laid out in question and answer form. The first question was &ldquo;when will the hospital open?&rdquo; and the answer was that planning for the hospital started in earnest in 1981, that the various stages of planning and building take a total of ten or 11 years and that therefore the hospital would open in 1992.  The Minister's colleagues in the constituency were not happy with that at all, especially when there was a different Coalition Government in power, and they published an advertisement in June 1989 which sets out a very specific commitment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the strictures of the Chair.  I merely wanted to validate that in that election of 1989 the local Fianna Fáil TDs promised to bring forward the construction of the hospital to 1990.  They were not satisfied with it starting, as scheduled, in 1991 and they undertook to bring it forward to 1990. The advertisement stated that the chairman of the Tallaght Hospital Board, Professor Richard Conroy, and the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, had agreed to accelerate the development programme and that &ldquo;it is now hoped that work will be under way in about 15 months time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One can imagine the boost that was to an area that has been so under provided for.  It was a big factor in that election and people's hopes and aspirations were greatly boosted by that undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not just a question of a badly needed medical facility in my part of the constituency but it also holds out the prospect of some 1,800 people being <Col N="1636" /> employed at the new hospital.  I know well that there will not be 1,800 new jobs but nonetheless it does contribute to developing an economy within the Tallaght area which is so badly needed.</P>
    <P>Another question on that prospectus was as to what size the hospital would be. The prospectus stated that it was planned that the first phase of the hospital which would open in 1992 would contain 450 beds with full supporting outpatient services, full accident and emergency service and all of the support departments such as pathology laboratory, X-ray departments, operating theatres, physical medicine, physiotherapy, dialysis department, pharmacy, chaplains, a social work department and so on.</P>
    <P>What kind of hospital would it be? The hospital would be a major regional teaching hospital serving the people of Tallaght, west Wicklow and south Kildare.  It would be associated with the Trinity Medical School and have a full nurse training school with post graduate medical facilities in all disciplines.</P>
    <P>What would the hospital mean to the community in the area?  It would provide the most modern and sophisticated medical facilities in the country, a centre of learning for medical research and a meaningful liaison between community medicine such as family doctors and other community health professionals through the use of a post-graduate medical centre designed specifically for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Where would the hospital be?  We know where the hospital will be in due course.</P>
    <P>When would building start?  Building was scheduled to start in late 1988 or early 1989.</P>
    <P>How much would the hospital cost? The budget price set by the Department of Health on 1 January 1984 was £62 million for the total project.</P>
    <P>How many jobs would be provided? There would be some 1,600 employees in the new hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister will readily appreciate how major a project that is for the people of south west Dublin.  It is not just the 90,000 people in Tallaght, it is the 50,000 people in Clondalkin and the people of <Col N="1637" /> the adjoining small areas of Rathcoole, Newcastle, Saggart, Brittas, Walkinstown right down to west Wicklow and part of Kildare.  It is a major catchment area, the most densely populated and fastest growing in the State, almost one quarter of a million people, and yet we are now told that this is being put on hold.</P>
    <P>Let me compare it, as I have done before in this House, to the situation in Limerick where there was a political dispute a few years ago about the closure of one of three hospitals in that city, a city that is smaller than just the Tallaght portion of the catchment area I am talking about.  One could, for example, compare it with Galway, where they have the Regional Hospital, the Galvia Hospital and Merlin Park, three hospitals in a city of 40,000 to 45,000 people compared with this area of almost a quarter of a million people.</P>
    <P>I have to urge the Minister to try to give this some priority because it is a major issue in the delivery of health care in my area.  I notice that in a recent statement from the Secretary of the Hospital Board, Mr. Des Rogan, he talked about his hope of work being enabled to start next summer, and my understanding is that it would cost about £6 million to allow work to start.  The Minister sitting here today must know whether she has found that £6 million to enable work to start.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister can find a similar amount &mdash; it is a coincidence &mdash; to allow work to start on the Tallaght Regional Hospital next summer.  I hope we will not have any argument, and the junior Minister would seem to suggest that we will not when, at one of the flood of public meetings, if you will forgive the pun, that took place throughout the constituency he assured the people that &ldquo;the management structure will not hold up the hospital.&rdquo;  He did not say, to be fair to him, that the financial problems might hold it up &mdash; I do not want to misquote him.  I would like to hear the Minister reiterate that commitment, that the management structure will not hold up the hospital, because, for a number of reasons, I would hate to think that the debate about the ethos of the hospital would be revived.  It would be unhealthy that we should have the sort of divisive debate that happened a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about the history of the <Col N="1639" /> three hospitals that are to comprise the new Tallaght hospital, all of us in this House would agree that for a great many years now the Adelaide Hospital has had an inclusive ethos.  It is quite wrong to refer to it as having a protestant ethic or for the Minister to want to impose a Roman Catholic ethic.  I sincerely hope that debate will not be given a new lease of life by any temporary dispute that may have happened between the three hospitals, because the preponderance of people who have reason to be grateful to the Adelaide would agree with the view that the ethos obtaining in that hospital has been an inclusive one.</P>
    <P>The wish expressed by the Church of Ireland to maintain a direct relationship with a major teaching hospital is, I submit, a perfectly understandable one. I am aware that the Church of Ireland Bishops, for example, met the Taoiseach on two occasions and, according to my information &mdash; I subsequently met some of the same people &mdash; they were very pleased with the Taoiseach's understanding and appreciation of the importance of this dimension.</P>

It is critically important that we maintain an even keel, that we do not allow any divisive issue to be introduced into this and that, above all, we do not use it as an excuse for not proceeding with the hospital.  It is not an issue that provokes the slightest dispute within Tallaght.  The people of Tallaght demand that the hospital be constructed.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the Catholic Clergy have been very active in the campaign to have the hospital built&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me say very quickly that the Catholic clergy issued a circular, in all the parishes of the constituency, in which they expressed their concern at the postponement of the Tallaght hospital project and pleaded with the public representatives of all parties to make representations to the Minister for Health to make sure the project went ahead.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in this difficult Department and plead with her to put the construction of the Tallaght hospital back on the priority list in the Department of Health.  Even at a time when resources are scarce, the provision of £6 million should not be an insurmountable barrier having regard to the scale of the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to thank Deputy Byrne for allowing me to make a brief contribution at this stage.  I understand he will wind up the debate on behalf of The Workers' Party. I also wish the Minister well in her new portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in an aside &mdash; I will <Col N="1641" /> be corrected if I am wrong about this &mdash; the Minister in her contribution announced that, having considered the position in relation to the accident and emergency service in the Dublin area, the hospitals will revert to the system which obtained earlier this year under which all the six major hospitals will be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, from now on.  If that is so, I am very pleased.  While Deputy Rabbitte holds a certain view in relation to the position in certain areas of the city, those who have to rely on the general accident and emergency service provided in our hospitals will be very pleased with this announcement.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter in the House on 24 October with the then Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, I asked him whether he would be prepared to act on an interim report on the operation of the accident and emergency service in Dublin but he indicated he had only received the report and was not in a position to make any comment.  When I pursued the matter with him I came to realise very quickly that he did not seem to appreciate the nature of the problem.  He proceeded to tell me that people living in rural areas &mdash; he gave Belmullet as an example &mdash; had to travel up to 50 miles to get to their nearest hospital whereas in Dublin people only had to travel six to ten miles at the maximum to get to a hospital.  I explained to him, however, that a person from Belmullet would not be obliged to pass a major hospital on the way.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that people living in rural areas have to travel great distances to get to a hospital for people in Dublin it can be a major problem to get from one side of the city to the other. For example, people living in my own community on the northern fringe of the city and close to Beaumont Hospital could not always go to that very fine institution in the event of an emergency or accident.  They were sometimes obliged to find their way to other hospitals, such as Blanchardstown, using <Col N="1642" /> the public transport system which, incidentally, does not operate after 11 p.m.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise this matter is that in the week gone by Beaumont Hospital was on call.  However, because of the demand for the service in the accident and emergency department, by 8.30 p.m. on a number of evenings they had been inundated with cases and had to divert all callers after that time to the other hospital on call.  Therefore, even when it was on call it simply could not carry the workload.  For those reasons, I am very pleased with this announcement that a comprehensive service will be available. No doubt it will be stretched during the winter months.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to indicate if the Department have any proposals &mdash; I note that this matter was not dealt with by her in her speech &mdash; in regard to the disposal of waste from hospitals in the Dublin area.  We have now reached crisis point. The environmental health section of Dublin Corporation recently carried out a survey of the 27 major hospitals in Dublin city and its environs by way of questionnaire.  Ten of the hospitals, two of which are responsible to the Department of Health, failed to respond.  I do not want to name any of the hospitals concerned because it was indicated that excuses had been tendered in the case of some of them.  It is incredible, however, that the environmental health officer did not receive the full co-operation of the health institutions concerned.  The picture painted is extremely worrying.</P>
    <P>When Beaumont Hospital was constructed, an incinerator was installed to dispose of all waste on site but it has not been used since the hospital was opened because it does not meet the standards laid down.  When we went after the English contractor who installed it we discovered he was no longer in business. Beaumont Hospital, therefore, has a very expensive &mdash; but now valueless &mdash; piece of equipment on hands.  As the result it has to dump its hospital waste in a landfill site on the north side of the city.  This is <Col N="1643" /> not a satisfactory method of waste disposal.</P>
    <P>There is no incinerator in Dublin city which matches the standards laid down by the EC and the Department.  All of the incinerators available to the hospitals in Dublin, therefore, are not up to standard or are inadequate.  This is a major problem.  The matter was highlighted in a recent report of the environmental health officer of Dublin Corporation in which he underlined the urgent need to provide an incinerator to allow hospitals in the Dublin area dispose of their surgical and other waste.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the services for mentally handicapped persons but, as this issue was dealt with in an adequate and comprehensive manner in the debate during the week, I do not intend to go into it now.  While I appreciate the Minister has been asked by Deputies on this side of the House to deal with matters urgently, I put it to her that her Department should respond in the near future to the question of the disposal of hospital waste.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy McCartan, for being brief, thereby giving me the opportunity to contribute.</P>
      <P>This is quite a large Supplementary Estimate &mdash; in excess of £50 million.  I am often amazed that Departments' budgets are so much out of line that Ministers have to seek the approval of the House for extra money.  People in the health services feel that the Minister has an obligation to provide more money and the Opposition can only support such a Supplementary Estimate.  Although we support this allocation it is inadequate and therefore we will be opposing the Supplementary Estimate.  I ask the Minister why more money is not being provided for this area because quite clearly this amount is not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the 1989 election the Taoiseach pleaded ignorance about the state of the <Col N="1644" /> health services.  The Fianna Fáil Party had obviously lost touch with the grassroots and the public.  Everybody was amazed that the Taoiseach would state that he did not know the health service was in such a bad state.  I remind the Minister that it is still in a desperate state. This Minister will not have the opportunity to make the excuse that she is not aware of or is not in touch with people who suffer as a result of the chaotic health services.</P>
    <P>The Minister is new to this post and I have already welcomed her to it. Although I am not The Workers' Party spokesman on Health, I periodically stand in for my colleague, Deputy Sherlock. The Minister is a fast learner and she will know of the crisis in the hospital service, particularly in the accident and emergency services.  She will have heard the pleas of carers of people with mental and physical handicap.  I am sure she is aware of the huge numbers of men, women and children on waiting lists for admission to hospital, and of the trauma they suffer as a result.  The Minister will have heard of the crisis with the care of the elderly.  She should be aware that there are at least 50 geriatric patients at present occupying beds in the Meath Hospital because no beds are available in nursing homes.  This hospital is bursting at the seams with patients, many of whom are inappropriately located there.</P>
    <P>The Minister will know of the huge problem with the care of the elderly. Some groups are successfully engaged in political lobbying and the Minister is aware of the problems of the people they represent.  For example, she is aware of the problems facing the mentally handicapped because of high profile lobbying in that area, but I will devote a few minutes to the care of the elderly, who do not seem to have the same degree of political lobbying behind them.  Statistics show that people are living longer due to modern medicine and better care.  Therefore the present crisis in caring for the elderly will get progressively worse as time goes by.  There is nothing as tragic as people suddenly realising that an elderly <Col N="1645" /> father or mother is in need of hospital or nursing home care.  They are shocked at how difficult it is to find a nursing home with a vacancy and then at the cost of nursing home facilities.  Many of these families are ill equipped to meet that cost and the health boards cannot satisfy their needs due to an inadequate number of beds.  I hope the Minister will take action in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that due to the huge waiting lists for acute hospitals, general practitioners request their patients to use the accident and emergency services to gain entry to these hospitals.  There are thousands of people waiting for elective surgery.  The Minister spoke earlier about the accident and emergency services.  She should look into the reason general practitioners use this system as a way of getting patients into hospitals.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on reintroducing the 24 hour accident and emergency service in the six acute hospitals in Dublin city.  What amazed me was the way her predecessor, in trying to save £750,000 or £2.25 million, depending on which report you read, arbitrarily introduced a rota system. However, no money has been saved and, quite rightly, the accident and emergency units in the six acute hospitals are being opened again on a 24 hour basis.  While the maximum 12,000 bed facility will be retained, because general practitioners and others are using the accident and emergency system as a means of gaining access to hospitals, I appeal to the Minister to consider major reports, such as the accident and emergency report.</P>
    <P>I am told there are reports sitting on the Minister's desk gathering dust.  If those reports were implemented it would help solve some of the problems with the accident and emergency services.  This is quite a complex problem which will not be solved just by opening the accident and emergency units on a 24 hour basis. Much more needs to be done.  Although <Col N="1646" /> I welcome the reintroduction of this service on a 24 hour basis, unless the hospitals are allowed to open wards that have been closed, to bring on stream more hospital beds so that the people who are on waiting lists receive treatment, general practitioners and others will continue to use the accident and emergency services to gain admission to hospital.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that the Minister has reverted to opening the six hospitals to deal with accident and emergency cases.  A number of hair-raising incidents occurred over the past number of weeks, including the Beaumont incident.  Whatever about adults having to wait, it is disturbing to hear that because of staff shortages in Crumlin Children's Hospital children have had to wait for 12 hours to see the appropriate doctors in the accident and emergency unit.  We also had the case that because of excessive demands on the Meath and Beaumont hospitals accident and emergency cases had to be diverted to other hospitals.  It was inevitable, therefore, to revert to having six hospitals on call.</P>
    <P>The Minister has to make a serious decision to use her political determination to ensure that there is an injection of sufficient funds into the health service to make the services for the care of the sick more acceptable than they are at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced that six hospitals will remain open on a 24-hour basis to provide an accident and emergency service, but that they must do this out of their existing resources.  Presumably this will have a cash implication and I would like the Minister to confirm whether the hospitals have sufficient resources to provide the accident and emergency service so that people will not have to wait 12 hours to be seen or be left lying on a trolley in hospital corridors or waiting rooms.  It is one thing to instruct the hospitals to provide an emergency service, but what will happen if there are not enough beds?  It is a <Col N="1647" /> chicken and egg situation.  While one can demand that six hospitals remain open on a 24-hour basis, if additional beds are not provided, there is no real improvement in the health service.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that some of the moneys being provided in this Supplementary Estimate would go to implementing the recommendations of the report of the review group on services for the mentally handicapped.  If the Government have made a policy decision to accept the findings of this report, money is needed to implement its recommendations. I will not get involved in a re-run of the debate on services for the disabled; nevertheless it is important to put on record that people caring for the intellectually disabled have a tremendously difficult life to live.  For many parents or family members, it is a 24-hour difficult task every day.  One could become emotional about the experiences of some mothers as they struggle to care for their intellectually disabled offspring. Christmas is often not a happy time for carers of the intellectually disabled. Because of the constant demands being made on them and the need to give 24-hour constant care to the handicapped person, every day is the same, Christmas day included.  The Minister has the power to make it a real Christmas for the carers. I appeal to her to use her power at Cabinet to activate a plan for the implementation of the recommendations of this report.</P>
    <P>During Question Time I tried to get the Minister to agree to accept the findings of the arbitration board on the IMO's claim for a 40 per cent increase in fees under the GMS.  Over 1.25 million people depend on the GMS scheme.  The IMO have threatened to take strike action and withdraw the services of their members from the GMS.  The Minister must realise that the withdrawal of services from so many vulnerable people would be catastrophic. Without a shadow of doubt if the threat was carried through and services <Col N="1648" /> were disrupted it would result in death, injury, misery and a further deterioration of patients' health.  Clearly there is a case to be met in regard to the doctors who are exclusively servicing the needs of the GMS patients.  The IMO have a legitimate case, although I might have reservations about a claim in excess of 40 per cent at this time.  Although there was a threat of a possible bus and rail strike, CIE agreed to go to arbitration and agreement was arrived at.  I ask the Minister to commit herself to accepting the findings of an arbitration board on the claim now being pursued by the IMO.  It is better that an amicable solution be found without disrupting the service to medical card holders.</P>
    <P>I know that the Dublin Dental Hospital is not solely the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  However, a site has been acquired in James Street for a new dental hospital because the existing buildings have been condemned by the fire officer, time and time again.  The Dublin Dental Hospital makes an invaluable contribution, particularly to the marginalised section of the population, medical card holders, prisoners, haemophiliacs, and AIDS victims.  The staff are working in unbelievable conditions.  The Minister should liaise with her colleagues to ensure that the proposed building of the Dublin Dental Hospital proceeds.</P>

      <P>Again let me ask the Minister to look at the waiting lists.  In the Eastern Health Board region there are 7,000 people seeking orthodontic treatment for which the waiting time is four years for treatment.  There is also a growing waiting list for the treatment of varicose veins, which is a relatively simple operation.  Increasingly, people are finding difficulty in having that relatively simple operation carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall leave it there for the moment <Col N="1649" /> and hope that the Minister will find an opportunity to answer some of the questions raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to raise several matters which in my view defy logic and cost the State money.</P>
      <P>The Minister wants increased resources for health.  There are practices imposed by her Department and by others which, if changed, could lead to a saving of money.  The saving of such money could result in the Minister being able to extend medical card benefits to those who need them and could allow us revert to the system whereby medical drugs costs are paid on a monthly rather than on a three monthly basis.</P>
      <P>I wish to talk specifically about means testing.  There may be as many as 20, or even more, different means tests applied by the State.  Means tests are operated by the Departments of Health, Social Welfare, Environment, Justice and Education.  For at least four years I have been pressing in the House for the provision of a single national eligibility test.  I hope that I am not straying too much from the main Estimate but I do want to highlight the anomaly that thereby arises.</P>
      <P>If somebody becomes unemployed, for instance, he or she has to go through the hoops seven, eight or nine times at least to obtain the benefits to which they are entitled.  They go through all these different means tests in just as many different public offices, taking up the time of the same number of public officials.  Very often those means tests are set to different criteria and applicants are confronted by all kinds of traps and anomalies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been arguing strongly for one national eligibility test so that the humiliation, degradation and inconvenience caused to the poor is stopped; so that people do not have to go through the hoops eight or nine times.  If people are subjected to an eligibility test for a medical card and are successful, they should <Col N="1650" /> be granted a certificate of means, which certificate should be accepted without further question for all other State means tests.  That practice would save a great deal of official time as well as eliminate much inconvenience, humiliation and degradation caused to people who become less well off.  Could the Minister please say why there is not one single national eligibility test for all State services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised the subject on several occasions in relation to the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare.  An interdepartmental committee were set up by the former Minister for Finance, now Commissioner MacSharry.  That committee were to report within a year, and that was four years ago.</P>
      <P>The anomalies continue and I shall go into them in a moment.  Not only that, each budget in the past four years has worsened the anomalies.  The Government are spending money, trapping people in poverty and worsening public service.</P>
      <P>Just this morning, for instance, I was confronted by the case of a separated wife with two children who was not in receipt of the deserted wife's allowance or any supplementary welfare because her older child was working and she was assessed on that child's income.  Of course the older child was not handing in that income.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed Deputy Mitchell some latitude but the matters to which he refers impinge on the responsibility of other Ministers.  They are not the sole responsibility of the Minister in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested, and I would be glad to listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1651" />
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that in order to get a medical card, the provision of which is the responsibility of the Minister for Health, that lady had to have her older child leave home.  The mother was not getting the income of her older child, though it was included in the assessment. When the older child left home the mother not only got a medical card, she received supplementary welfare and rent assistance; she qualified for everything. By pushing that child out of her family home an enormous additional cost accrued to the State.  Such an occurrence is not unusual, it is happening all the time because the means of children are taken into account in these cases.</P>
      <P>In another case with which I am dealing a mother of a large family has valiantly, despite her own poorish health, struggled to keep a disabled child at home.  Again because of the aggregate means of the family, that mother is deprived of the carer's allowance.  She does not want the carer's allowance for herself, that money is needed because of the extra requirements of the disabled child.  The mother will be forced to put her child into an institution&mdash;I can see that coming within the next few months &mdash; because she just cannot cope any more.  Again because of family means the mother is also denied a medical card.  What will happen is that her child will end up taking a costly place in an institution.  The child will be away from the family and will cost the State perhaps as much as £500 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Means testing must be reformed urgently because the system is riddled with anomalies that cost the State money. The biggest anomaly is the creation of a great poverty trap.  If a couple with two or more children live on social welfare they are already poor &mdash; and I want to emphasise that point &mdash; but if the husband or the wife takes up a job and earns the average industrial wage or less, because means testing is taken from gross pay and not net pay and because of tax, social insurance and so on, the family will be worse off.  That is the classic poverty <Col N="1652" /> trap.  Instead of becoming net subscribers to the Exchequer, such couples are trapped in poverty and become net drawers from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>If the system of means testing were changed to assess workers for medical cards, differential rent, higher education grants and so on, on net pay rather than gross pay then the large part of the anomaly would be removed.  Having workers' means assessed on gross pay when it should be assessed on take home pay is costing us money.  Since 1984 assessments for everything in the United Kingdom have been taken from net pay. The means of a worker cannot be assessed on gross pay which is never received. Workers should be assessed on the money they get into their hands.  So long as that very unfair anomaly against workers remains the poverty trap will be tied in and will continue to cost the State extra money in the Health Estimate as well as in other Estimates because people are forced to take alternative steps. Deputies deal with such circumstances every day of the week.</P>
    <P>Anomalies such as occur in the cases to which I have referred cost the State money and they also infuriate the people in the street, who learn of the anomalies and wonder what we, as elected representatives, are going to do about them. When people become unemployed they experience the humiliation of being put through all of the different means tests at different offices, offices that are often located at the end of an expensive bus run &mdash; an expensive bus run that they cannot afford.</P>
    <P>In respect of all State services, whether within the Department of Health, Social Welfare, the Environment, Education or Justice &mdash; with regard to matters like criminal and civil legal aid &mdash; I propose that individuals should be able to go to their local health centre, not entailing an expensive bus ride, and have their circumstances ascertained by way of an eligibility or means test.  In addition, I propose that any certificate issued should <Col N="1653" /> obtain for all other services and should last a year, even if their circumstances were to improve within that year.  Otherwise we are spending a lot of money, not on administrative duplication, trip-tuplication or more, very costly triplication or more, very costly administration, and very humiliating inconvenience for citizens while, in the meantime, the services deteriorate.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into the hospital health services today.  Others have gone through their inadequacies, the waiting lists and so on.  I want to talk about those who are not in hospital but who may have to go to hospital because of poor out-of-hospital services.  In particular I want to refer to the medical card.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that that change is effected for 1992, that medical cards would be granted to workers on the basis of their take-home pay, the money they get into their hands, not on their gross pay.</P>
    <P>The recent changes in relation to claims under the drug refund scheme which mean that one must expend so much over three months before obtaining any rebate should be reversed.  I know it is State money but it was a mistake, is very unfair and is an added burden on those families already penalised by sickness. I do not know what are the savings, but I am quite sure that, in a full year, they are a lot less than was made in some recent property transactions in this city. That is tremendously important.</P>
    <P>This debate is taking place at a time of unparalleled unemployment.  Even in recent months we have seen reports of the connection between unemployment and health; there is a very real connection. Indeed, it is not just psychological health that is affected but physical health as well.  Unemployment adds enormously to the health problems of a family because of the pressures it creates. We should not add to those pressures by humiliating people when they become unemployed, by putting them through these several hoops.  Because of the <Col N="1654" /> additional health problems created, not merely for the unemployed themselves but among their families, we should not be adding to their costs by saying they must spend so much more in three months than had been the case previously before they get any refund.  I appeal to the Minister to endeavour to help people remain at home.</P>
    <P>I know there are three other speakers wanting to contribute but when we have the full debate on the Health Estimate in the coming year I hope I will have more time to spell out my concerns and suggestions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to other speakers wishing to contribute, I too shall be brief.  In the circumstances I intend to confine my remarks to one aspect of the Supplementary Health Estimate rather than range across the whole spectrum.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to that most important question in my constituency, the failure of this Government to provide, in this Supplementary Estimate, for the construction of the Tallaght Hospital.  This disgraceful position has been adverted to in this House on many occasions.  Yet, here is a Supplementary Estimate introduced for £50 million without any indication that the Government intend to fulfil the commitment given in this House going back over a period of years.  Tallaght is now a town of 90,000 plus people. Plans for a hospital were laid out and a commitment to its construction given by this Government.</P>
      <P>I might refer now to a motion in Private Members' time introduced in this House on 6 December 1988, in particular to the Official Report of that day at column 47 when the Labour Party gave up their Private Members' time to a debate on the development and needs of Tallaght.  That debate was responded to by the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, when he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new hospital at Tallaght will be one of the major general hospitals for the Dublin area and will, together with <Col N="1655" /> Naas Hospital, serve the population of south-west County Dublin, the western portion of County Wicklow and the southern portion of County Kildare.</P>
    <P>At the bottom of the same column the Minister had this to say:</P>
    <P>This Government are committed to the Tallaght Hospital project and approval has recently issued to the board to proceed to stage 4 of the planning process.  It is anticipated that if the present rate of progress is maintained construction work will commence in mid-1990.</P>
    <P>We have seen how almost £9 million of taxpayers' money has already been expended on this project.  Year on year this House voted moneys towards the continuation of that project, its development, the drawing up of designs, plans and so on.  Perhaps twice-yearly I tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health on this project.  For example, on 18 July 1989, I asked the then Minister for Health if he would make a statement regarding the present state of development of the proposed new hospital for Tallaght.  The Minister replied as follows:</P>
    <P>Planning for the provision of the new hospital at Tallaght is at an advanced stage.  It is anticipated that if the present rate of progress is maintained construction work on the first phase of the development will commence in 1990 and should be completed in 1993.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  We find a complete abdication of the responsibilities and commitments, freely expressed by this Government, to the needs of the people of Tallaght and the surrounding areas for their hospital.  The people from Tallaght have to travel great distances to St. James's and the Coombe Hospitals incurring transportation expenses they cannot afford, incurring risk to life and limb as a result of delays in having to go there. Indeed, we know that the existing city centre hospitals Tallaght Hospital is <Col N="1656" /> intended to replace are old and past their period of economic and proper usefulness. The Meath Hospital has wonderful staff, they do a magnificent job, but the buildings are more than 200 years old and crumbling.  It is not acceptable in a modern world that such buildings should continue to be used.</P>
    <P>The Government introduced a £50 million Supplementary Estimate for health but the £10 million required in 1991 and 1992 to get that project at least moving, does not appear in this Supplementary Estimate.  No way can the Labour Party support that.  It is a sell-out of the people of Tallaght.  It is an absolute disgrace that, having given the House their firm commitment, having used up £9 million of taxpayers' money, the Government now abandon those £9 million and are not prepared to say that, in 1992, they will commit moneys for Tallaght for that much-needed hospital for the people of the area to enable them get that project under way.</P>
    <P>The board of the Tallaght Hospital was set up years ago comprising tremendous expertise, doctors, nurses, specialists and politicians &mdash; I served on it for a while myself; they met on 104 occasions.  Can you imagine the number of man hours these experts gave, voluntarily, to draw up those plans and designs for the Tallaght Hospital, being thrown out the window?  It is a matter of indifference to this Government that all that work and all that money have been ploughed into this much needed essential facility which was promised.  What is the response?  The response has been a brick wall, nothing, no interest, no care, no appreciation of the needs of the men, women and children of Tallaght.  That speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will oppose and vote against this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to be brief to allow Deputy Belton to contribute. On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas.  I am opposing this <Col N="1657" /> Supplementary Estimate.  The cost overrun for this year amounts to no less than £50 million or nearly 4 per cent of the original Estimate.  The fact that public expenditure on Health this year has reached £1.4 billion is an appalling indictment of the state of the nation's health. The Minister's Department should be called the Department of Illness.  Their response is always reactive rather than progressive.  They see people who are sick and say they must be cured.  That shallow, short term attitude to the nation's health is reflected in this enormous expenditure.  The attitude of the Department should be holistic and preventive. They should ask why people are ill in the first place.  In fairness, in the past two or three years there have been some signs of movement and consultants are talking about the stress factor in heart disease and cancer.  We must ask the basic question &mdash; why is stress such a factor in our health profile?  I am sure it was not so 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>The pollution of our cities by coal and motor vehicle emissions is a major factor in the nation's health.  It should not be forgotten that while considerable progress has been made in Dublin in reducing air pollution levels due to the ban on the sale of bituminous coal, serious problems still exist in other large cities such as Cork, Limerick and Waterford and smaller provincial towns.  No proper monitoring is taking place in these cities and towns.  In money terms alone the cost to the taxpayer of maintaining people with respiratory problems in hospital is enormous.  Now that pollution from bituminous coal has been substantially reduced in Dublin, attention must be paid to car emission levels which can be a major health hazard.  Drastic reorganisation of Dublin transport is needed to get cars out of the city centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drugs are a major cost factor in the health services and, although there was an apparent price reduction during the year, the cost of drugs seems to increase all the time.  Again, the stress factor and <Col N="1658" /> the lack of a holistic approach to curing patients manifests itself.  Whereas the Department of Health are quite rightly attempting to effect price reductions in drugs, the Department of Industry and Commerce are doing the exact opposite by their promotion of the Patents Bill which extends the life of patents from 16 to 20 years.  The effect in the pharmaceutical industry is to maintain the high prices charged by patent drug companies for a further four years.  I am surprised the Minister did not refer to this. Any further cost cutting in this area will be extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>Hospital accident and emergency services are appalling, particularly in the Dublin area where it is not unusual to wait hour upon hour for attention.  A nation which allows this to happen has its priorities wrong.  The ever-lengthening queues for operations are another manifestation of this.  The hospital services are undoubtedly at crisis point.</P>
    <P>While in Opposition Fine Gael are most vociferous in their call for greater health expenditure but while in Government they pursued Thatcherite economic policies, to the great disadvantage of the poor and the underprivileged.  Many middle-class families suffer from health cuts, yet at elections they vote for reactionary parties like Fine Gael or either of the Government parties.</P>
    <P>Most distressing is the inadequate provision for the mentally handicapped. Surely every Member accepts the need for a realistic budget in this area.</P>
    <P>The Green Party are very concerned at the cost of running the health services and in the long term we would like to see costs considerably reduced by the adoption of a less stressful and more healthy lifestyle.  Great savings can be made by treating the symptoms of the disease, be it diet, the living and working environment or the whole economic insecurity of Ireland today, before the symptoms become a debilitating illness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with issues relating to the Midland Health Board region. The Minister referred in her speech to Tullamore General Hospital and the orthopaedic services there.  This matter has been a major problem for quite some time and the consultants called together all the local politicians, emphasising their anxiety about the lack of services in this hospital.  These surgeons are under extreme pressure and the waiting lists are huge.</P>
      <P>Some people in County Longford have been waiting 18 months or two years for treatment.  I spoke to a man at a function recently who has been taking pain killers for the past month and his prospects of a hip operation in the near future are almost nil.  I welcome the reference to two new theatres at Tullamore Hospital in order to increase the services in the orthopaedic unit and I hope this project will be undertaken quickly.  Coming as she does from the midlands, the Minister must be well aware of the problem.</P>
      <P>The orthodontic service in County Longford is nil.  There is a waiting list but nothing is happening.  There is absolutely no service for primary school children.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of all the good work which has been done at St. Christopher's in Longford.  They are awaiting funding for a residential home there and at Granard and I hope the Minister will see to it that the Midland Health Board can provide the necessary funds for that worthy project.</P>
      <P>The casualty unit in Longford is not all that we would wish but it is providing a service.  Some anxiety has been expressed about it and I want to emphasise how important it is.  We were hoping to have a new unit built and the Minister might consider that matter.</P>

      <P>I thank all Deputies who have contributed to this debate. The speeches were interesting and informative and I agreed most heartily with Deputy Garland who wished to see a less stressful and more healthy lifestyle, <Col N="1660" /> thereby reducing the Health budget.  Would that it were so simple.  It would be lovely if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a very nice Deputy but sometimes one would think he is living in fairyland.  He seems to think that everything would be lovely if we all adopted an outlook similar to that of the Green Party.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised several points. He made accusations about incompetence in my Department.  I have only been there a short while but they seem to be entirely competent.  He also said they appeared to be unwilling to supply information.  I do not accept they are unwilling to supply information.  I will pay assiduous attention to any parliamentary questions put down by the Deputy from now on to ensure that he gets the information he wants.  He referred to payments to health agencies. All these agencies will get the appropriate pay increases in addition to what they have got.  It was mischievous of the Deputy to say they had to make savings in their estimates to pay costs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton also said the Government had made an illegal raid on the VHI.  I accept that in the Dáil we speak under privilege but I should like to put it on the record that I am sure no illegal raid on any organisation was made by my predecessor, by the Government or the Department of Health.  The word &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; seems to be the &ldquo;in&rdquo; word for some Deputies.</P>

      <P>I will be making further announcements in 1992 about the <Col N="1661" /> development of the AIDS programme. All areas of health are vital but AIDS is one area to which we have to give very great priority.  The Deputy also asked about the freeing-up of money.  As I said, there will be a freeing up of £7.745 million in subhead G.1 as a result of the provision of additional lottery funds under subhead G.9.</P>
      <P>All Deputies referred to services for the mentally handicapped.  I accept their bona fides in this respect.  People who speak on this subject usually know someone with a mental handicap.  As I said last week, I intend to develop a coherent plan for the provision of services in the mentally handicapped area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ferris referred to the problems being experienced by certain health agencies due to a lack of finance and he went on to talk about the Medical Council.  I dealt with that matter during the week and I was rather alarmed by what he said. He implied we should pay for some of the expenses incurred by the Medical Council.  As the House will be aware, they are the regulatory body for the medical profession, are self-financing and are responsible for the investigation of issues such as the one which arose in Beaumont Hospital.  The Deputy went on at some length about this issue.  The position in regard to this council is as I have outlined. Naturally I regret the events in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>Both Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Taylor referred to the Tallaght Hospital. The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, and I have discussed this matter and I have read most of the brief on it.  I hope to shortly meet with a representative group&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind comment.  However, I should <Col N="1662" /> point out that there is a big difference in the cost.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne said that I was a fast learner.  I do not know what to make of that comment.  Nevertheless, I am always delighted to get a compliment of any kind.  He referred to the needs of the elderly, to the Meath Hospital and the acute hospital services.  As I said, I hope next year to consider the establishment of geriatric assessment units.  He also spoke with feeling about the mentally handicapped and the disabled.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the problem of waste disposal in Dublin hospitals.  This matter was raised in an Adjournment debate in the Seanad some time ago and a very detailed answer was given to it.  This is a complex issue and it needs to be properly addressed.  There is no point in adopting a short term solution to the problem.  I accept that this is an issue to which I must address myself.  My ex-constituency colleague, Deputy Belton&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could be the Minister's constituency colleague again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if there is another census before the next election. However, I do not think that will happen. I should like to thank Deputy Belton for contributing to the debate.  He referred to the Midland Health Board area, with particular reference to Tullamore, and the casualty service in the Longford Hospital.  As I said, the Midland Health Board occupy a very modest space in terms of the other health boards.  Somebody said it will not always be like that and we should wait to see the estimate for the Midland Health Board next year. If I increased their allocation I would be accused of being partisan.  I have to take into account all aspects of my brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the word &ldquo;cutback&rdquo;. I do not have the figures with me but the expenditure on health this year will amount to approximately £1.4 billion. <Col N="1663" /> This represents an increase of approximately 11 per cent on the start-up figure at 1 January last year.  One can never spend enough on health or education. People need the services provided in these areas and the requirement for these services increases each year.  How one can call an increase of approximately 11 per cent a cutback is remarkable.  One can never give enough.  Every country is experiencing the same difficulties in the provision of education and health services.</P>
    <P>I am not one bit daunted by the challenges facing me and I look forward to dealing with them and to hearing the many fine ideas which will be put forward <Col N="1664" /> during debates on health in the House.  I look forward, in particular, to working with all the agencies in the health area.</P>
