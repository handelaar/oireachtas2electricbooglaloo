      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the Government propose to table a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare in view of the fact that the budgetary estimate for unemployment was 228,000 and there is now an unemployment level of approximately 253,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last few days it has been established that there will be a cutback in the recruitment of Garda personnel. In view of the sinister development in Border areas &mdash; I refer to the incident of Sunday night in my own area &mdash; I would like the Government to clarify the position.  Incidents such as <Col N="1424" /> took place on Sunday night are now a major threat to every family living in Border regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The formal announcement last night by the Commission of its proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy makes this debate very timely.  After a series of regrettable leaks which have given rise to immediate and predictable reactions the stage is now <Col N="1427" /> set for the beginning of considered analysis and painstaking negotiations.  It will be a long and difficult road before the conclusion of negotiations, a conclusion which will require significant differences from the initial proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It will be a long and difficult road before the conclusion of negotiations, a conclusion which will require significant differences from the initial proposals if it is to be acceptable to Ireland, and not just to our farmers, because of the unique importance of the whole agricultural sector to our overall economy.</P>

      <P>I hope I will be allowed the injury time I will need at the end of this match, even though, in any event, we will beat them in normal time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of the importance of the agricultural sector to our economy that the Government have pledged to the social partners in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the fullest consultations at all stages of the negotiations that will begin at the Council of Ministers next week.  Concessions must, of course, be fought for in negotiations but simultaneously action must be taken which is entirely within our capacity to successfully meet the challenge <Col N="1428" /> of a new agricultural order in Europe and worldwide.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, we stand at a crossroads. The agriculture and food sector has seen expansion and contraction, rising and falling incomes in periodic movements over the last two decades &mdash; long gone are the heady days of the seventies when commodity price increases were there for the asking.</P>
    <P>These movements have been influenced by internal and external economic and market factors.  But all the time there has been the moderating element provided by the market based support system of the Common Agricultural Policy. Now, as a result of a cumulation of domestic and international factors, we are faced with a fundamental overhaul of that policy as set out in Commission proposals adopted yesterday.  That overhaul could have the most far reaching consequences, not just for farmers and their families but for all who lived and work on this island.</P>
    <P>Before we consider the detail of what is being proposed, and its likely consequences, there are a number of points which need to be emphasised.  First, these are proposals not decisions.  As I said, long and difficult negotiations will be necessary before we reach decision stage. Secondly, there have been significant changes over the past ten years in the way in which the CAP is organised and managed and this drift, with adverse consequences for Ireland, would be set to continue if there were no reform decisions.  Thirdly, the mechanisms of the CAP are not written in stone.  What is important is that the principles on which it is based are not sacrificed and that they are given effective implementation.</P>
    <P>The Commission indicate that these proposals respect these principles.  Even if that were the case what is at issue is whether the new or revised mechanisms effectively implement them.  It is on this crucial question that the Irish response must be decided.  I will return to this critical point in the course of considering the Commission proposals.</P>
    <P>While the pressure for reform was given an immediate stimulus by the growing budgetary and market difficulties in <Col N="1429" /> several sectors during 1990, the need for reform had been evident for a considerable time.  It has been obvious for some years at least that a Community policy brought into being at a time when the European Community needed to increase its food production to feed its people was not the most effective and efficient at a time of surplus.  Of course, the fact that the Community has moved from a position of deficits in the sixties to one of surpluses in so many product areas today is confirmation of the effectiveness of the Common Agricultural Policy in meeting the main objectives set by the founders of the Community over 30 years ago.  The CAP has been so successful as to have become &mdash; to some degree at least &mdash; the architect of the problem now facing it.  Internal contradictions involving, in particular, different arrangements for cereals and competing products have added another major dimension to the problem.  At the same time, growing concerns about the need for better balance between larger and smaller Producers in the distribution of FEOGA support and increasing emphasis on food quality and environmental aspects have given a further impetus to the reform platform.  International demands, both through the GATT negotiations and requests from Central and Eastern European countries for increased access to Community markets are further dimensions to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Commission's broad approach to the reform process was set out in its reflections paper presented to the February Agriculture Council.  The Commission indicated that it based its approach on a number of key objectives, foremost of which would be the retention of sufficient numbers of farmers on the land.  Farmers would in future be seen as having dual functions of producing food and protecting the environment in the context of rural development.  Another key objective would be to control production to the degree necessary to bring markets back into balance.  While the fundamental principles of the Common Agricultural Policy would be retained, <Col N="1430" /> the new approach would seek to ensure a different distribution of support while taking account of the difficult situations of certain categories of producers and regions.  In practice, this would mean a switch of support away from a policy of mainly price guarantees to one with greater emphasis on direct payments targeted to a greater degree to those in most need and the modulation of support arrangements and quantitative restrictions in favour of smaller-scale producers and disadvantaged regions.  In the Council, all Ministers accepted that the Common Agricultural Policy needed to be reformed although they differed on how this should be achieved.  There was an acceptance that current support arrangements, which were leading to higher budgetary costs and generating huge intervention stocks, in particular in sectors such as cereals, beef, milk, wine and tobacco, were not sustainable while incomes were declining.  In the light of the views expressed, the Commissioner undertook to consider further how to frame the reform proposals.</P>
    <P>This approach is set out in detail in the proposals which have just now become available.  In general, their thrust is broadly similar to that already signalled by Commissioner MacSharry earlier this year.  The Commission is proposing price reductions in many sectors together with some restriction on output and a significant package of structural measures. The other element in the proposal is a series of compensatory measures biased in favour of small to medium sized producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Specifically, the Commission is proposing a 35 per cent reduction in support prices for cereals over three years.  Producers would receive full compensation for the price reductions through a regionalised acreage premium but entitlement to such compensation would, in the case of producers other than small scale producers, <Col N="1431" /> be conditional on participation in a set aside scheme.  Producers with more than 50 hectares of cereals would, however, receive set aside payments only in respect of a maximum of 7.5 hectares.  These measures would replace the current stabiliser arrangements and the co-responsibility levy would be withdrawn. The Commission is also proposing reform measures for the oilseeds and protein sectors to ensure coherence within the arable crops sectors.</P>
      <P>For the beef and milk sectors, support prices would be reduced by 15 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, on a phased basis in part to reflect lower concentrate feed costs arising from lower cereal prices but also to take account of the market situations.  For the beef sector, current rates of premia payable in the case of male animals and suckler cows would be increased substantially and would be limited to the first 90 livestock units and to extensive producers, defined as those with maximum stocking rates of 1.4 livestock units per hectare in the disadvantaged areas and two livestock units per hectare elsewhere.  In addition, a new measure would be introduced to encourage the early slaughter of male calves from dairy herds and further measures will be proposed to combat the illegal use of prohibited substances.  For milk producers, a premium scheme would be introduced providing a premium on the first 40 cows in every herd in the case of extensive producers.  For both beef and milk, promotion programmes would be introduced with financing from producers, the industry and the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the price cuts in the milk sector, the Commission is also proposing further compensated cuts in national quotas.  Part of the cuts in individual quotas would be redistributed to priority categories while a voluntary cessation scheme would be introduced to avoid or moderate compulsory quota cuts for small and medium sized producers with quotas of less than 42,725 gallons.  In addition, permanent buy-up arrangements would operate to provide for redistribution, restructuring or adjustment of <Col N="1432" /> quotas depending on the market situations and the co-responsibility levy would be withdrawn.  In an innovative measure, payment of compensation and cessation premia would be by way of guaranteed bonds.</P>
    <P>For sheepmeat, the Commission is proposing to limit eligibility for premia to 1990 levels with lower ceilings on the numbers of animals in flocks eligible for premia.</P>
    <P>Reform measures are also signalled for some other sectors such as tobacco and wine while the support arrangements for other products will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of reforms to the major sectors.</P>
    <P>To complement the reforms, the Commission is proposing a series of measures in the agri-environment and structural areas.  The measures would be negotiated with the member states to take account of local and regional conditions.  The type of measures envisaged include compensation for extensification of production, environmentally friendly farming and long-term set aside of land. In addition, there would be a more attractive early retirement scheme and increased and extended incentives for afforestation.</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated, the full details of the Commission's proposals have only just been released and these will, of course, have to be fully assessed before we can respond in a comprehensive way to the approach involved.  There have of course, already been some discussions at the Council on the need for Common Agricultural Policy reform.  In those discussions, while accepting the need for reform, I have made Ireland's position very clear.  In particular, I have stressed the important role of agriculture as the dynamo in Ireland's total economy and have left my colleagues in no doubt about my requirement that the reform must respect Ireland's vital interests and afford the fullest safeguards for the future of all <Col N="1433" /> categories of family farmers.  I have cautioned against adjustments which go beyond the strict needs of market and budgetary requirements and have insisted that the revised Common Agricultural Policy must continue to respect the provisions of Article 39 of the Rome Treaty.</P>
      <P>I have also pointed to the need for balance in the adoption of reform measures between the very legitimate expectations of smaller scale producers, that agriculture will continue to afford them the opportunity of a livelihood and the requirements of the more commercial element in our agriculture &mdash; an element which is vital to the maintenance of a competitive and vibrant food industry. As in the GATT negotiations, I have insisted that adequate Community funded compensation be made available to offset the adverse effects for producers and regions of support reductions flowing from the Common Agricultural Policy reorientation.</P>
      <P>The importance of securing a satisfactory outcome for Ireland on Common Agricultural Policy reform has been to the forefront of Government thinking over several months.  This was given concrete recognition in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> where the Government committed themselves to keeping the Common Agricultural Policy reorientation under the closest review and to using all their influence with the Commission and our Community partners to secure our interests.  I have been actively following through on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, of course, had regular contact with the Commissioner and, at either ministerial or senior official level, we have met almost all other members states over the past six months to underline the Government's concerns about the forthcoming agricultural reforms and to set out unambiguously Ireland's requirements. I believe that as a result of these meetings there is now a greater appreciation of our needs in the various Community capitals.  I expect that this will be very helpful to our cause as the negotiations proceed.  Furthermore, now that the details of the proposed reform <Col N="1434" /> have become available we will intensify our efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to do all that is necessary to keep our Community partners fully appraised of all our concerns. The Dáil can be assured that the Government are fully conscious of all the implications of Common Agricultural Policy reform and of the vital necessity to the entire economy that a balanced and satisfactory outcome can be secured. The Taoiseach underlined this at the recent summit.</P>
    <P>While Ireland's general approach to Common Agricultural Policy reform has been spelled out since the debate commenced, it is not possible, as I have already mentioned, to adopt a definitive position until all the details of the proposals have been fully analysed and their consequences assessed.  This examination will include not only consultations with relevant organisations on the approach to be adopted throughout the negotiations as provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, but it will also make use of the most appropriate research and economic analysis such as recent work by the ESRI.  Before any decisions are taken or positions adopted, the Government will be honouring their commitment &mdash; again in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; to present the organisations involved with an assessment of the consequences of the reform proposals for Ireland.  This work is already under way in my Department.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is clear at this stage that further cuts in milk quotas and substantial price reductions create major difficulties for us, especially as the effects of the price cuts fall unevenly on different regions and different types of production. With the exception of tobacco, the reforms only affect the cereals and livestock sectors.  These sectors are, of course, at the heart of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>Within the livestock sector the comparative positions of red and white meat producers would be disturbed.  There is an imbalance in the treatment of the compensation issue between the different sectors; livestock producers relying on <Col N="1435" /> the less intensive grass based production would be inadequately compensated by comparison with more intensive cereals based production.  This surely conflicts with one of the declared aims of the reorientation which is to give an impetus to extensive, more environment friendly production systems.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a lack of appreciation in the proposals of the vital part played by agriculture in the entire economies of certain member states and of the damaging consequences of particular measures on the general level of economic activity in such countries, including employment levels and the balance of payments.  Of course, the new approach will also be more costly in budgetary terms, at least in the medium term.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, positive aspects in the proposals.  Substantial compensation is provided, especially for small and medium-scale extensive producers who constitute the majority of farmers in Ireland.  There is at least an acknowledgment that we should be concerned with support for family, rather than factory farming &mdash; although Ireland might not fully agree with the way in which it is proposed to do this.  The socio-structural package has a number of attractive elements in it.  There is a promise of a greater concentration on rural development policies arising out of the mid-term review of the operation of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>We are not necessarily opposed to the Commission's intentions.  We have, however, major difficulty with the details.  These will, of course, be the substance of the negotiations and it is impossible even to guess at this stage what the final outcome will be.  It is, however, possible to be clear about the elements which will need to be present for the outcome to be broadly acceptable to Ireland.  We will need to be satisfied that the mechanisms finally agreed effectively implement the underlying principles of the CAP; adequate financial resources are guaranteed both immediately and in the longer term to underpin the policy; <Col N="1436" /> adequate support is given to ensure that the vital commercial element in our agriculture remains viable; support for extensive production takes realistic account of what is required to maintain the economic basis of modern family farms; compensatory elements do not discriminate against grass based livestock production; the needs of economies critically dependent on agriculture are properly met; and any changes in the CAP are dovetailed with, and given full credit in, the finalisation of the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>The last mentioned point is critically important.  We must ensure that the GATT negotiations take place in parallel with the negotiations on the CAP reform package.  Any agreement reached in one must take account of what we are to agree in the other.  Otherwise we run the risk of losing out on two fronts.</P>
    <P>The GATT negotiations are again returning to centre stage.  It is certain that another major effort to bring the round to an early conclusion is about to get under way.  The House will remember that the Community and the participants have been committed since 1986 to agree in the Uruguay Round on a more market orientated agriculture trade policy through substantial and progressive reductions in support.  The Heysel meeting in December broke down mainly because the US and some others could not agree with the Community on the nature and extent of these reductions, I might say, because we could not agree with the United States on the nature of their demands.</P>
    <P>Following the resumption of the negotiations in February and the US Congress agreeing to extend the fast track negotiating procedure, the negotiations are likely to take off again over the next few months in expectation of a decision before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Major difficulties, however, remain in the GATT negotiations.  The US, despite occasional indications of increased flexibility, have not changed substantially from the position they adopted in the December meeting and that position is broadly supported by the Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries, <Col N="1437" /> including Australia, New Zealand and Canada.</P>
    <P>The Community's GATT offer, which was agreed only after long and difficult discussions last autumn, proposed a 30 per cent reduction in aggregate support for groupings of the main products by 1995-96 from the 1986 levels with a 10 per cent reduction for other products. All non-tariff Border measures would be converted into tariffs under certain conditions and the resultant tariff equivalents would then be reduced by an amount reflecting the reduction in support prices. Export supports would not be subject to any specific level of reduction but would be reduced as a result of reductions in support and protection because of certain subsidiary commitments.  While some further signals were given by the Commission in the course of the Heysel discussions last December, the Community's global position remains unchanged and is essential for us.</P>
    <P>During the discussions on the Community's offer at the Council I insisted that producers had to be compensated for losses attributable to the GATT outcome. A majority of Community Ministers also supported this stance.  As a result, considerable safeguards were built into the Community's proposal.  In particular, the Commission gave undertakings on complementary measures, on ensuring Community preference and a clearer commitment on safeguarding export refunds.  The Commission has accepted that any future adaptations to support and arrangements that will be necessary shall take into account the difficult situation of certain categories of producers and regions and that the total level of assistance to the less favoured regions should not be reduced as a result of the implementation of the outcome of the GATT negotiations.  This is particularly helpful for Ireland now that I am on the point of having 72 per cent of the country classified as less favoured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Sheehan ever heard of an A point at Council negotiations then he would be pleased to know that this will be an A point at the next Council meeting because of the work we have done with our colleagues.</P>
      <P>I am determined to ensure that the Community's basic position is upheld in these negotiations, as I believe are my colleagues in the Council, despite demands from some members within the Community and elsewhere for further concesions to be made.  I have made my position clear on the need for the fullest involvement of the Agriculture Council in the negotiations on agriculture.  It is also important that agriculture is not isolated and targeted in the GATT negotiations, as the US and the Cairns Group would like to do.  The conclusions of the recent summit were very helpful in relation to this and to the continued involvement of Agriculture Ministers.</P>
      <P>However, we should not take an entirely negative view of the Uruguay Round.  There are many positive aspects to it.  The achievement of a settled and liberalised environment will facilitate international trade, and not only to the benefit of our competitors.  It is not just a one way street.  Such an environment is preferable to a retreat into regional trading blocs which would impede trade, restrict the growth of economies and lead to ever increasing numbers of trade disputes involving retaliation and counterretaliation. Finally, the GATT negotiations offer is the only way in which we can secure agreements to have output controls operated by the other Community reciprocated by the other major producing and trading countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of the agri-food sector to the Irish economy is unquestionable. Apart from the vital role it plays providing outlets for our agricultural products, it is the single most important element in the economy and in our external trade.  The sector accounts for about <Col N="1439" /> £6 billion or almost one-third of our total manufacturing output.  It is also a significant contributor to employment directly at manufacturing and processing level and indirectly in the distributive, catering and service trades.</P>
    <P>For too long, however, the ability of the food industry to reach its full potential was stified by overreliance on commodity trading and market support systems. That situation will have to change.  Over the past few years the Government, acting through my Department and the various agencies concerned, have been working strenuously to maximise the industry's contribution to the wellbeing of the entire country.  This is being done by providing the support and encouragement, both financial and otherwise, which the industry needs to enable it to become more fully market-led; in other words, an industry which can supply food of the type of quality demanded by consumers and which can be produced and sold competitively.</P>
    <P>The process of change is a slow and sometimes painful one and results are not always immediately obvious.  I am confident, however, that provided the momentum for change, which has built up in recent years, is maintained, the food sector and all those involved in it will have a very bright future.  The Government, of course, will continue to play their part.  On this point I should remind the House that in the three years up to December 1990 a total of £117 million &mdash; £75.3 million in national aid and £41.7 million by way of FEOGA aid &mdash; was awarded to the agri-food industry.  In addition, already this year I have announced the award of substantial further national aid to the pigmeat and dairy industries.  I should also like to remind the House of the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to seek special funding to enable the food industry to adopt to changes in the CAP support system. That commitment will be honoured.</P>
    <P>In all of this, we are in the main targeting value added production to move us away from reliance on intervention <Col N="1440" /> products.  To underpin this effort in the dairy sector, I have recently announced grant aid for a major new research and development project at Moorepark into which all the key players in the dairy sector can now link.</P>
    <P>While it is true that EC supports can mitigate prices and income problems in the short term, in the longer term the future is in marketing more of our products in premium outlets in the EC.  We joined the European Community to have access as of right and not as a favour.  We have been in the Community for nearly two decades and while there have been great strides, for example, in building up meat vacpac exports, much more could be done, much more must be done.  A successful marketing strategy to put more Irish products on Community supermarket shelves requires funding, quality assurance and targeted promotion of the product.</P>
    <P>That is why a year ago I encouraged CBF to prepare an industry wide strategy which would involve producers, processors and exporters, that is, all those whose contribution is essential to achieving recognition that our product was not only wholesome and met the highest health standards but ranked with the best quality the rest of Europe had to offer.</P>
    <P>I considered that this was a priority and, despite the rigorous constraints on the public finances, the Government allocated an extra £0.25 million to CBF last autumn.  This year I was very pleased to obtain a doubling of their grant-in-aid to £1.5 million.  The industry, too, are making a special voluntary contribution of £1.5 million to finance the planned target of 10-15 per cent growth in beef sales to Europe in 1991.  With these resources and moneys from the EC Structural Funds, CBF's income in 1991 will be over £7.5 million or double what it was two years ago.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned, quality.  A quality product like Irish beef, produced in superb natural conditions, can realise its full benefit only with successful promotion and marketing.  Government can assist, but the future rests ultimately with <Col N="1441" /> those in the beef sector whether producers or processors who are close to the cutting edge of the market.  Quality must be built in at each stage of production and marketing.  It is not an optional extra. That is why I was delighted recently to launch a quality assurance scheme for beef which aims to establish a new identity for Irish beef on continental and other markets.  Its clear intention is to position Irish beef on premium markets.</P>

      <P>CBF are providing direct market entry support for beef sales to Britain where they have planned a series of promotions in supermarkets. They will expand promotions in the five target markets &mdash; France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain and are opening an office in Spain.  I have personally participated in promotion campaigns in Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.  I have been very encouraged by the response and propose to continue this work in coming weeks and months.</P>
      <P>One thing which we cannot afford to allow is any activity which taints our reputation as a producer of good wholesome food.  In this regard I would like to say something loud and clear about the illegal use of veterinary drugs for growth promotion. I have already made some strong statements on the matter.  I reiterate that those involved in illegal activities can except no mercy.  They will be pursued and subjected to the full rigours of the law.  A number of cases are already listed for hearing.  I am determined that any illegal use of these substances shall be stamped out.  The confidence of consumers and the reputation of our meat industry cannot be put at risk because of the irresponsible action of a small group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unrealistic to claim that nobody will ever attempt to break the law.  But what I can, and do, claim with conviction is that I and my Cabinet colleagues are fully aware of the importance of the meat industry to not only the farming community but our economy as a whole.  We are prepared to take whatever <Col N="1442" /> measures may be appropriate to ensure it is protected and that its good reputation will not be damaged.</P>
    <P>I have already informed this House of my intentions to introduce some further legislation to facilitate the detection of offenders and to make provision for substantially increased penalties in certain circumstances.  However, I must point out that legislation and penalties alone will not deter some individuals who take a very short-term view of the profits to be gained from their illegal enterprises. We cannot guarantee that these unscrupulous individuals will not attempt to break the law, but we can make the exercise extremely difficult and highly unprofitable.</P>
    <P>I have said before that the problem can be eliminated very quickly if the collective will is there.  The representative associations of all the partners in the beef industry condemn this illegal activity. I encourage all members of these associations to follow this advice.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude on this issue by pointing out that, following eight months of extensive surveillance and testing, the evidence available shows the alleged levels of abuse are exaggerated. Reports emanating from Ireland have been picked up by the international media and have put pressure on the reputation of the natural, wholesome quality which our beef enjoys.  I wish to assure the House that where these reports have appeared, appropriate action has been taken to counteract the allegations made. Officers of my Department serving in Irish embassies abroad have been most vigilant in this regard.  In addition CBF have been fully briefed on the factual position and the measures being taken to counteract abuse in order that the necessary assurances can be given to customers. Furthermore, I am very pleased to note that, as I have already demanded in the Council, the Commission will propose a programme to give reassurance to consumers in relation to the absense of substances such as devil dust, not angel dust, hormones and other prohibited substances in meat.</P>
    <P>This issue of quality is of critical <Col N="1443" /> importance to Ireland.  We must be able to make full use of our natural advantages as a food producing country.  Our aim must be to be perceived as the European producer of natural organic food.  I will not be satisfied until the strict regulations we have introduced here and are now implementing are followed on a Community-wide basis.</P>
    <P>While the &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; side of the CAP will continue to be the principal conduit through which the Community's support for agriculture will be channelled in the future, the contribution of the Structural Funds will take on increasing importance in the years ahead.  As I already mentioned, the Commission is proposing an improved financial package for a range of structural measures including early retirement, forestry, extensification and environment-friendly farming practices. These should form a useful supplement to the many measures already operating in the structural areas.</P>
    <P>The Government have the strongest commitment to maximising Ireland's usage of the Community's structural support arrangements in ways which develop rural areas generally.  The House will already be aware that in October 1988, with assistance from the EC, I launched a pilot programme for integrated rural development in a number of specially-selected areas throughout the country.  The aim of this pilot programme was to promote &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; development through encouraging the communities in those areas to decide on their development priorities, to take the necessary steps to bring them to reality and be responsible for the results.  The programme was a success, so much so that I have now got the approval of the Government for a nationwide rural development administrative structure in the light of the experience we gained from the operation of the pilot programme. My intention is that this structure will administer the scheme for small and Community enterprises contained in the operational programme for rural development which I announced last December.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> All of the other measures proposed in this operational programme have now been implemented.  In general the programme provides for diversification of agricultural production through alternative farm enterprises, including agri-tourism, for infrastructural measures such as rural roads and fishery harbours, and for assistance for training and education services for agriculture and fisheries. This has meant that in recent months I have been able to introduce new schemes of grant aid to encourage onfarm enterprises such as deer, horse and other animal production, for greyhounds, for a new nationwide agri-tourism scheme, the response to which is very encouraging indeed, for horticulture and for services in rural areas.  The programme also contains support for R &amp; D and marketings in the food industry. Teagasc has been given the role of promoting the new measures among the rural community.</P>
    <P>Another significant development about which I am quite pleased is the Community's initiative for Rural Development known as Leader.  This is a very exciting and innovative initiative which provides an opportunity for the rural community to identify a role for itself and to actively participate in its own development.  The aim is to improve the development potential of rural areas by tapping local initiative across a broad range of areas and activities and by supporting the community in actively working to realise its own plans.  The underlying philosophy is similar to that employed in our own pilot programme which is one of development from the &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; rather than from the &ldquo;topdown&rdquo;. Local bodies are actively engaged at present in drawing up business plans I look forward to a whole series of exciting projects emerging from these plans.</P>
    <P>On the disadvantaged areas, Deputies will be aware that in the Programme for Government of September 1989 commitments were given to increase headage grants, to negotiate with the EC on a maximum extension of the disadvantaged areas, to introduce an appeals system <Col N="1445" /> for borderline areas not included in the extension and to abolish the off-farm income restrictions from 1990.  I am very happy to inform the House that all these commitments have been honoured.</P>
    <P>As regards our extension proposals, the final stages of ratification are expected to be completed in the coming week for an extension of 1.9 million acres.</P>

      <P>As regards our extension proposals the final stages of ratification are expected to be completed in the coming week for an extension of 1.9 million acres.  This extension will be the largest secured by Ireland since accession and increases the percentage of our land area designated as less favoured from about 60 per cent to 72 per cent which is almost five times that secured by the then Government in 1985.</P>
      <P>As regards reclassification, our proposals to reclassify over 1.3 million acres to more severely handicapped status and almost 300,000 acres of mountain sheep grazing land to less severely handicapped status are at present under active consideration by the technical services of the Commission and should be adopted in the fairly near future.  Provision has been made to increase headage payment rates later this year and this will complete the four stage programme for the disadvantaged areas outlined in the Programme for Government.  The abolition of the off farm income, the extension and reclassification of areas and the increase in rates will lift the annual cost of the headage schemes from £60 million in 1989 to £100 million this year &mdash; a very significant increase by any standards and one which will benefit the low income sectors of the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, for the first time, an appeals panel has already been appointed and procedures have been introduced to enable local groups of farmers in areas <Col N="1446" /> included in the extension to lodge appeals this month against exclusion and to have their cases reviewed.</P>
    <P>The farming community in Ireland have had two very difficult years for a variety of reasons.  Some of these were market related and the consequences of the build up of surpluses.  Some related to changes in Eastern Europe &mdash; desirable politically but with attendant trade complications. Some related to factors as diverse as the Iraq was and the BSE problem, and some to changes in the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Where we have been able to take mitigating action nationally &mdash; including using our influence to moderate proposals to change the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; we have done so.  But the fact remains that the environment in which we make policy and in which our farmers and processors must operate has fundamentally changed.</P>
    <P>The agri-food sector and the Irish economy generally have benefited to a significant degree in the past from the Common Agricultural Policy arrangements. Neverthless, we cannot ignore the deficiencies in the existing policy.  The nature of the support system has led to the development of production unrelated to market needs.  Substantial Common Agricultural Policy expenditure has not prevented the decline in farm income or the drift from the land.  We would be deluding ourselves in believing that existing arrangements can be maintained with minor amendments.  There is a willingness in the Council to adjust the Common Agricultural Policy fundamentally to make it more relevant and responsive to current and forthcoming requirements, although Ministers differ in their approach to reform.</P>
    <P>We cannot hide from the implications of the Commission proposals or of the GATT negotiations but neither should we exaggerate their consequences nor fatalistically accept what is on offer.  The Community can stand firm in the GATT and reach an agreement which is reasonable and takes account of what we have done and may do in the future in regard to changes in agricultural policy. <Col N="1447" /> Furthermore, we can ensure that commitments on compensation are honoured.</P>
    <P>On Common Agricultural Policy reform, nothing can be gained by imitating the ostrich.  But neither should we abandon our stand that changes in the policy must respect the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy, protect family farming, not factory farming, take account of the diversity of agriculture in the Community and be based on a secure and guaranteed budgetary framework.  I intend to use all the resources available to me to oppose those aspects of the proposals which do not meet these aims and which, as a result, are neither in the interests of Irish agriculture or of the Irish economy.  In this, I know I have the full backing of the Government.  I trust I have the support of the House.  I have also the support of the industry generally and of its representative bodies.  United behind a clearly identified national position we can ensure that reform of the Common Agricultural Policy works for rather than against our long-term interest.</P>

      <P>The applause is noted, muted though it was.</P>
      <P>Commissioner MacSharry's proposals must be a cause of considerable concern to all the people of this country, not just the farmers.  For Ireland to lose hundreds of millions of pounds per annum will put a major strain on an already depressed economy.  It is a true adage that when farming is doing well the country is booming. Conversely, when farmers come under pressure every sector of the economy feels the impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot allow the proposals put forward in Strasbourg yesterday to become law.  We in Opposition will render every assistance to the Government in fighting our country's corner.  Our European alliances with the Christian Democrat parties who share in the rule of six <Col N="1448" /> member states will be utilised to the full by our Leader, Deputy John Bruton, myself and our MEPs in an effort to avert what would be by far the greatest setback we have suffered since our entry into the Community.</P>
    <P>I am alarmed by the smugness and downright indifference to the seriousness of the problem by the national media. Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is definitely a necessity but it should not be at the expense of tens of thousands of jobs here, on and off the farm, as well as the financial ruination of many of our best farmers, No European Community compensation will repay those who have borrowed and worked hard to build up farms.  Irish cereal farmers will become as rare as the corncrake, if not totally extinct.  Ever since the leaking of the original document in December last the media have viewed the implementation of the proposals as being inevitable.  The proposals announced yesterday belie everything that has been said by the Government in this House over the last six months.  The leaked document was genuine.  We knew since last December what was coming.  Yesterday confirmed our worst fears.  On foot of the leaked document we could not get a debate in this House because the Government pretended that the document did not exist.  Of course it existed, and the sooner we started to fight the better would have been our chances of winning.</P>
    <P>It is only today that we are having a debate on something which will have a massive impact on the whole economy, on every man, woman and child in the country.  The Government and the Minister have been seriously negligent in pretending that the problem did not exist and &mdash; to use the Minister's own expression of ten minutes ago &mdash; have been sticking their heads in the sand.</P>

      <P>Since the leaking of the documents in December last the media have taken the implementation of the proposals for granted.  They have looked on those proposals as being of little consequence to anybody other than farmers.  This is not so.  The worst aspects of Commissioner MacSharry's proposals must be opposed and defeated.  Commissioner MacSharry says that over 90 per cent of Irish farmers will be fully compensated.  We do not have any faith in those promises.  Even if the compensation was granted, and was desirable, which it is not, we do not have any faith in that promise.  The 160,000, who constitute 90 per cent of the farmers here, should be able to work the land as they have done for centuries.</P>
      <P>We do not want to see this land lying idle.  These people have pride in their work and do now want to depend on hand-outs.  Both the Minister in his speech here today and the Commissioner in his proposals have missed this totally relevant point.

      <P>Some of the worst protagonists who fought years ago supposedly for farmers' rights are now strutting around in sheep's clothing neatly bleating and saying that the proposals are okay and everything is in order.  This is despicable, dishonest and totally anti-national.</P>
      <P>I would have no confidence in a compensatory payments system as I do not believe it would ever compensate hardworking farmers.  In addition, I cannot see the EC Commission putting up the massive amount of money required to pay eight or nine million European farmers &mdash; that is the total if one takes approximately 90 per cent of the ten-11 million farmers in the Community.  It is much more likely that individual Governments, particularly those of the industrialised nations, will have to subsidise their farmers with national aids, something, of course, we cannot afford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what is going to happen.  Commissioner MacSharry can talk about compensatory payments until the cows come home but the fact, is that the Commission is not going to give the money which would be necessary to compensate milk and beef farmers for the losses they will incur.  These proposals are primarily an attack on beef and milk farmers.  Of course, farmers who are involved in cereals can forget about it &mdash; they are supposed to be eliminated.  It is also an attack on sheep farmers.  Under these proposals cereal farmers can forget about it.  There will be a huge reduction in income for beef and milk farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British, Germans, French and even the Italians, all major industrialised nations, will be able to provide compensation nationally to their farmers. Therefore, what we are seeing is the total <Col N="1452" /> dismantlement of the Common Agricultural Policy and individual countries will have to subsidise their farmers, something we cannot afford.  I want to give a simple example to illustrate this point.  Not alone can we not afford to subsidise farmers but according to a report issued during the past few days by the ESRI &mdash; themost reputable independent economic survey groups in Ireland &mdash; we will have to raise as much as £700 million extra in taxation by the year 1995 if these proposals go through. If we have to raise £700 million extra in taxation rate for which we were all hoping, this will mean a massive hike in rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred &mdash; and he has done this numerous times lately in the Dáil &mdash; to the disadvantaged areas scheme and to the considerable increase in the most recent submission.  He also pointed to the 1985 submission which was put forward when we were in Government. There is no comparison between that submission and these proposals.  I want to clearly point out that there was no crisis in farming in 1985.  Incomes were buoyant and we were getting annual increases of considerable dimensions from Brussels.  That is not the scenario today.</P>
    <P>This year, for the first time since we entered the Community, we suffered a major loss in the annual price package negotiations.  The conservative estimate is that we lost £80 million.  Last year there was a drop in farm income of 16 per cent. The projection for 1991, without any of Commissioner MacSharry's proposals being implemented, is of a further drop of 11 per cent.  The severe reductions in farm income and minor cutbacks in Brussels yielding a loss of £80 million are whole new ball games.  Is it any wonder that every farmer wants to be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme?  Farmers are not fools.  They sense, probably very correctly, that if their land is not classified as disadvantaged for either headage payments they will not be beneficiaries of compensatory payments and, even if they are, that they will be of a <Col N="1453" /> very minor nature.  Their demands and requests to be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme is a reflection of what they think of the negotiating ability of the Minister and the Government in this instance.</P>
    <P>The number of farmers wishing to be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme is like a stampede.  I have attended meetings all over the country which have been attended by hundreds of farmers.  They know that things have gone totally wrong and they want some sort of safeguard.  They believe the disadvantaged areas scheme will enable them and their families to survive.  These people have reason to be concerned.  The Minister said today: &ldquo;We are not necessarily opposed to the Commission's intentions&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, has repeatedly stated up to as late as yesterday that the problems facing the agricultural sector in Europe arise from the surpluses and he has blamed European Community farmers for causing this problem.  He is being extremely unfair and dishonest because the surpluses being stored in the Community at present &mdash; this is disgraceful and I would not dare to be the last to deny it &mdash; correspond with the imports of agricultural produce from outside the Community, some of which have been imported legally but a huge amount of which has been imported illegally.  Yet, he has made no reference to this maniputlation and distortion of the overall situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so naive to pretend that the problem could be solved by pulling the shutters up and stopping all imports but this is not practical and the Minister would get no sympathy in Europe if he were to plug that particular line. However, the true situation and the problems being caused by imports, in particular illegal imports from countries outside the Community, should be analysed.  This has not been recognised. We recognise that people in Western Europe, including ourselves, have sympathy for their colleagues in Eastern Europe, who have been oppressed for 50 years, realise that they must get some assistance and be given some concessions but the Minister should be honest and <Col N="1455" /> recognise, identify and state so.  He should not pretend that the problem has been created within the Community itself.</P>
    <P>An argument used widely by the media is that these proposals should be welcomed because they will mean a large drop in consumer prices.  We all know that that will not happen.  If the price being paid to the farmer, the producer, is reduced there will not be a corresponding reduction as far as the consumer is concerned. It may drop initially for appearances sake but within a matter of days or weeks it will go back up to what it was and eventually the price will be increased over the initial level.  That is the proverbial carrot being dangled to get the public on side but we should not buy that as it will not happen.  What I see very clearly is a considerable number of job losses in food processing industries as well as in allied industries, including the farm machinery sector and in industries manufacturing fertiliser sprays and all the other various commodities which are used in growing crops and producing livestock. There is a huge number of job losses in that area when money is not in circulation.</P>

      <P>These people who invest in agriculture will not be compensated.  I do not mean to make any disparaging comments about small farmers but it is the major producers who provide the bulk of what is produced in the country. If they are put out of business or if their production levels are reduced then all other industries such as farm machinery industries and the building sector which derive benefit from the construction of agricultural buildings will suffer enormously.</P>

      <P>A survey carried out by the ICOS, the Irish Co-operative Society which is the umbrella organisation for co-operatives, has clearly identified that these proposals will lead to the loss of 16,000 jobs in agri-related industries and businesses, as if the position was not bad enough already.</P>

Think of the effect this will have on the economy.  People in the media might say that I am being unfair in criticising their coverage but they have to face up to the fact that a further 40,000 people or perhaps more will lose their jobs.  Who knows exactly what the knock-on effect of these proposals will be but they will be catastrophic.  I do not want to be melodramatic.  I think the writing is on the wall and we all see it quite clearly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that Mr. MacSharry has seriously miscalculated.  He has not considered what the knock-on effects will be and has not thought it through.  We are the ones who are going to suffer.  No other country in the Community depends on the production of milk and beef to the extent we do.  Beef is ten times more important to us than it is to any other country in the Community while milk is seven times more important. We are all supposed to accept the same cuts although, relatively speaking, it is of far greater value to this country than to the other countries I have mentioned including the industralised states.  One could also mention Holland and Denmark who, because they have refined, <Col N="1457" /> modernised and efficient systems of agriculture, can afford to take the knocks but we cannot do so.</P>
      <P>Mr. MacSharry's plans take no cognisance of the loss of production which will lead to a major recession in the food industry which will lead to the job losses mentioned. I do not know whether the media have seen this &mdash; we have seen it &mdash; but one-third of all jobs in this country are to be found in agri-related industries which generate £6,000 millions a year.  If the Minister wrecks the agri-economy he will put that many industrial and farm jobs and money in jeopardy.  The loss of the economy would be beyond comprehension.</P>
      <P>It is very obvious that price reductions, even of the order of 10 to 20 per cent, although they could be considerably greater, for milk and beef in addition to quota cuts, will make many of our farm enterprises non-viable.  The collapse of the price of grain has a twofold downside for us.  It makes our cereal farmers noncompetitive and eliminates our advantage of feeding our animals cheaply on grass.  Agains, the significance of this has been lost on the popular press.  We cannot afford to lose that advantages.  We have enough physical disadvantages already, our domestic population being so small and our distance from the European market being so great, without having to suffer the loss of our one significant advantage, our ability to feed our livestock on cheap grass.  The collapse of the grain price eliminates that advantages.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is too important a segment of our economy to be treated on a par with the rest of Europe or America and we should remember that they are calling the shots.  Agriculture is by far our largest industry and cannot be allowed to be destroyed by problems originating in mainland Europe and further afield.  Our farming techniques are traditional and efficient and are not a major contributory factor to the problems of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We should outlaw factory farming but not family farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we have invited some of our problems.  Our milk co-operatives, and many of our meat plants, have depended <Col N="1458" /> for too long on subsidised storage and guaranteed prices, better known as intervention. These industries, in conjunction with the farming organisations, should have devised a strategy to lessen our dependence on price support systems such as intervention and export refunds.</P>

The days of putting butter and skim milk powder into intervention storage are limited, but in the interim the Government must get derogations from the EC to protect our vital national interests.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food and, above all the Taoiseach, must see to it that the other Heads of State are acquainted with the gravity of our problem. It may be that the final decisions will be taken at the next or subsequent meeting of Heads of State but they will have to be decided by the Heads of State. We will have to fight every inch of the way.  We will support the Government as long as they are up front and fight a fair fight, as long as they are honest with Members of this House and the farming community.</P>

      <P>One thing that is fairly obvious from the contribution of the Minister is that he has not been out in the country contesting the local elections because if the Minister had happened to be in his constituency &mdash; indeed, I believe he told people in his constituency he would not be seeing them for about 12 months because he would be going off negotiating &mdash; he would have seen the extent of rural poverty and the pressure on the farming community.</P>

      <P>He would have seen the vast number of cattle on the land because there is nowhere to dispose of them.  He would have heard people complaining about the price of calves because they cannot sell them but there is no evidence in the Minister's script of any basic understanding of the gravity of the difficulties facing families right across the farming community, big and small, milk and beef producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, for months, has been evading the serious difficulties which were coming at him like a train at 90 m.p.h. in the hope that somebody would pull the brake before he would meet the train.  He has had to come into the House to explain his position.  The other parties have the opportunity of starting their concerns and the Minister, and the Government, will go off and negotiate.  I am not sure if that is in the best interest of the farming community and the economy as a whole.  We have lost valuable time. We have known what would come from the European Commission yet we have been stuck in our position which is that we will wait until we know the proposals in detail, after all Commissioner MacSharry is one of our own and he will not let us down.  So much for <Col N="1460" /> old friends looking after their old friends. Obviously, the full impact of the Commission's proposals will hit home now that the statement has been made. However, by and large the proposals are not very different from what we anticipated over the past 12 months.  I am at a loss to understand why the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and his Department, were not be in a position to state the Irish Government's position.</P>
    <P>I do not think the farming community were expecting too much of the Minister, his junior Ministers of the Government in asking them to state clearly and categorically the position from which they would not be departing.  The farming community should be able to feel they have somebody they can depend on fighting for Irish agriculture in Brussels. However, on the basis of the Minister's speech this morning I am afraid Irish farmers will go home more worried than they have been for the past 12 months.  I do not believe the Minister is aware of the anxiety of farmers.  Farmers would not complain in the past because they felt they were getting a fair crack of the whip but they are now up against the wall and have no options.</P>
    <P>We are not just talking about individual farmers but about a very important sector of the Irish economy.  I am not sure whether the Minister has managed to convey to his colleagues in the Council of Ministers or, indeed, that the Taoiseach, who for the past 12 months has been waltzing away from the seriousness of this problem, has conveyed to his colleagues in the EC the vital importance of agriculture to the Irish economy.  It is clear from the tables that agriculture accounts for 10.3 per cent of our GDP.  Greece is the only country in the European Community with a higher percentage of gross domestic product from agriculture.  Are we talking about a level playing pitch?  Denmark derives 4 per cent of GDP from agriculture, the Netherlands 4.1 per cent, the UK 1.7 per cent and Belgium 2.2 per cent.  It is clear that the impact of European proposals on these economies will be minimal compared with the impact on the Irish economy, where 10.3 per cent of GDP is <Col N="1461" /> derived from agriculture.  There will be a massive impact across the beef and milk producing sectors.  The plans released last night do not take into account existing imbalances and the dependence of various sectors of the Irish economy on agriculture.</P>
    <P>We are not talking only about agriculture. When agriculture is suffering and cash is not circulating in the rural economy it affects the retailing, hardware and building sectors in town and villages.  The farming community do not have the cash they had two or three years ago, yet I did not detect in the Minister's speech an appreciation of the seriousness of this problem.  Years ago people used to say that Ministers were out of touch.  That was the glib expression used about every Minister in every situation.  I am forced to wonder if the Minister and his colleagues, whom I have described in the past as able men, are fully cognisant of the problem.</P>
    <P>I would have been far happier if the Minister had come into this House today with the backing of the Taoiseach and his colleagues and of the farming bodies, having had meetings with these groups and with the social partners, and the participants in the Programme for Government, and outlined in five or ten points the solid cornerstones of our agricultural policy.  The situation is very different.</P>
    <P>I hope there is no clear message in the Minister's departure.  Gone forever, possibly.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that we are not necessarily opposed to the Commission's intentions but that there are major difficulties quite obvious for all to see.  He said we are heading into a period of difficult negotiations, the outcome of which it is impossible even to guess.  I find it hard to understand why we have not a clear strategy designed to achieve our objectives, particularly since Mr. MacSharry holds the Community agriculture portfolio.  The Minister said that there are certain aspects with which we will <Col N="1462" /> have to be satisfied.  They are important aspects and they are worth restating. These are the principles on which we will have to protect our agriculture.  If we fall down on any of them, we are effectively losing the argument on behalf of Irish farming.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the mechanisms finally agreed will effectively implement the underlying principles of CAP.  He could have elaborated on the principles of CAP we wish to see retained. Is he totally satisfied?  There has been a strong body of opinion in this country in the past few years that the benefits of CAP have not been evenly distributed.  Well documented research has shown that 80 per cent of the benefits which have come from Europe have been directed to 20 per cent of the farming sector.  The farming organisations should be looking for changes to ensure that there is a fairer distribution of income from Europe.  It is not good enough that the biggest and strongest in 1973 continue to get bigger and stronger, while many people are getting off the land because they cannot survive and sustain their families under the present regulations.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about adequate financial resources to be guaranteed both immediately and in the longer term to underpin the policy.  I did not detect any long-term strategy revealed by Commissioner MacSharry last night.  He was talking about a quick fix.  Perhaps we should declare this to be a redundancy package for farmers.  The same unfortunate consequences apply to redundancy payments in agriculture as to industrial redundancies.  They are fine for the first six months but after that one is in serious difficulties.  I did not detect in Commissioner MacSharry's press statement yesterday or his arrogant presentation on television last night any long-term commitment to Irish farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about adequate support to ensure that the vital commercial element in our agriculture remains viable.  That is gobbledegook. He should have told us what he was talking about.  It is glib language which has <Col N="1463" /> no meaning to somebody trying to make a living on a small holding.  The Minister also referred to support for extensive production taking realistic account of what is required to maintain the economic basis of the modern family farm.  Again the Minister could have outlined how he intends to protect modern family farms as opposed to the big production units on the Continent which are far removed from farming as we know it.  Will the Minister guarantee protection for the family farm?</P>
    <P>He wants to ensure that compensatory elements do not discriminate against grass based livestock production.  If the present proposals are accepted, grass fed beef will become totally uncompetitive. We are saying we want to produce from a clean environment the best beef in Europe but at the same time the Commission seems to be quite happy with mass production in factory units on the Continent, irrespective of feeding or other arrangements.  The Minister is not nailing down the protection of grassbased production.  We are very proud of it but does it matter to the Europeans? The Minister will have to answer that question in due course.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that the needs of economies critically dependent on agriculture must be properly met.  Our economy is nine or ten times more dependent on the beef sector and seven times more dependent on milk.  I have not heard anything from the Minister that gives an indication that the Commission or the Council of Ministers appreciate our greater dependence on agriculture compared with our partners.</P>
    <P>The Minister focuses on changes in CAP dovetailing with the GATT negotiations. We are having this debate at quite a late stage and one has to be critical of the handling of the GATT negotiations by the Twelve.  The Americans know what they want and are pursuing it rigorously and with determination. Meanwhile the Europeans are trying to sort things out among themselves.  We are up to three years behind in establishing our position in relation to CAP <Col N="1464" /> and GATT.  We should have fixed our positions and be able to tell the Americans what European agriculture requires.</P>
    <P>We have left ourselves in a very weak negotiating position.  At all times the Americans have been the ones putting the cards on the table.  They have been stating their position and we have not stated our bottom line.  I wonder if the Minister can secure his objectives in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT at the same time.  We seem to be losing out on both fronts.  My worry is that because of sloppiness in the general GATT negotiations we are going to lose out on GATT and, in the meantime have been unable to protect our agricultural sector in terms of the changes now proposed by Commissioner MacSharry in the plan revealed last night.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister is not getting the agreement of this House today.  There may be some differences in the nuances of agricultural policy.  Some of the parties in this House may be more concerned for the consumer than for the farming organisations but, because of the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy I am quite confident that the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, could get an agreed motion or resolution from this House which would strengthen his hand and the Taoiseach's hand at the end of the day.  Ultimately it is the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Taoiseach who are going to have to carry the can with European colleagues.  It is unfortunate that they could not have come into this House, stated the position and gone out of this House this evening with an agreed resolution.  An agreed resolution would reflect the concern of the farming organisations, even though they have some differences among themselves on emphasis, the industrial sector and the people generally.  It is very obvious throughout the country that this is not a problem solely and narrowly confined to agriculture because agriculture has a bearing right across the economy.  Obviously this is going to end up with the Heads of Government for negotiation.  It is unfortunate that the Taoiseach cannot <Col N="1465" /> go to those meetings with an agreement arrived at with all the political parties in this country, all the political representatives and the farm organisations.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the three main farm organisations get together on this problem quickly and put down on paper for the Minister for Agriculture and Food the main problems as they see them.  It does nobody in the farming industry any good that we now have three organisations trying to protect farmers in different areas.  It is unfortunate that we cannot have an agricultural lobby stating the position clearly because of its seriousness and because of the drastic consequences for the Irish farming community if the MacSharry proposals go ahead.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister's speech does not give rise to great confidence.  He talks about exciting developments and repeated a number of announcements he had made already in this House. Unfortunately they seem like a party political broadcast to a very serious crisis. In one instance I can conclude that the Minister is admitting defeat.  Right throughout his speech he accepts what is coming down the line from Europe.  He talks about points of detail and says we must get more detail, as opposed to stating the principles and concerns of Irish agriculture.  I believe those principles have to be very firmly stated to our European partners and I am not convinced they have been so stated.</P>
    <P>The first realistic test of the MacSharry plan has to be whether it is going to work for farming and in the Irish context.  One wonders whether Commissioner MacSharry has asked himself if his proposals will strengthen Irish agriculture.  Will those proposals weaken agriculture?  Will poverty be eradicated from the family farm?  There is poverty right throughout family farming in this country.  Will agriculture continue to play the central role in the Irish economy it has played since the foundation of this State?  Will agri-business, upon which we have placed a great deal of emphasis in the last ten to 15 years, continue to be a viable business and a very important part of our economy? <Col N="1466" /> From my understanding of these proposals and from a first reading of them my response to these questions would be in the negative.  The plan is aimed at getting farmers out of farming as painlessly as possible from the EC point of view.  The essence of the plan is to ask milk producers to produce less milk, beef producers to produce less beef and cereal growers to produce less cereal.  That effectively is the net essence of the MacSharry proposals of last night.  If the proposals as enunciated last night are given effect we are talking about producing less milk, less beef and less cereal.  Obviously, if that happens Irish agriculture is going to become significantly smaller than it is at present.  There is little consolation in that for the people depending on agriculture.</P>
    <P>The plan says that without the reforms proposed by the Commissioner and adopted by the Commission annual surplus production will be well in excess of foreseeable export outlets.  In other words, the markets are not there, intervention can be tolerated no longer and farmers must be got out of farming, to put it bluntly.  It is easy enough to see the logic of this approach from a European perspective and given the minor dependency the European economies have on agriculture.  Obviously it is not big deal to them if they have to get farmers out of production and off the land, but in the Irish context the long-term implications of this plan are potentially horrific for Irish farming.  These implications must be examined without giving undue weight to the compensatory arrangements or the redundancy payments which are built into the plan because, in effect, these are purely transitory and will be gone in two or three years.  If the plan is worked through in its present form we will be producing far less, there will be fewer farmers and even for those fewer farmers average farm incomes will be significantly lower than they are at present.</P>
    <P>That is not all.  The balance of trade will be much worse for a country such as ours with all it implies for our small, open trading economy.  If far less is produced there will be far less to process and the <Col N="1467" /> employment knock-on effects will be substantial. The figures indicate that at least 5,000 jobs in the vital growing and processing industries will be lost.  That would be a tragedy when these industries are making an important contribution to our economy.  As is well known, the food industry in Ireland accounts for one in every five manufacturing jobs compared with about one in 12 in the Community as a whole.  It is worth noting that there are no proposals throughout the MacSharry plan to deal with the wreckage the plan will leave behind it throughout the agri-business sector.  It does not get around to looking at that aspect.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to make an objective assessment of the overall damage this plan, if unamended, will create.  The independent estimates from the ESRI, on whom certainly we can depend, forecast a decline in agricultural output of about £429 million, 17 per cent of which is hard to take by any standards, a decline in farm incomes of £200 million and the knock-on effects in industry and services of at least 5,000 jobs.  In addition, ICOS estimate that ultimately the plan will lead to a decline in farm numbers of about 22,500 coupled with an increase in family farm poverty.  As Deputy Deasy stated, if he had come into this House any time between 1983 and 1987 and put up these proposals there would have been a rush from the Fianna Fáil benches to get him out of the House.  He would have been called a traitor, what he would have been attempting would have been called national sabotage, or words to that effect, having regard to the social consequences of any such proposals.  The serious effects that the present proposals would have are reflected in the fact that Fianna Fáil backbenchers are not interested in this debate.  They are throwing in the towel as their Minister seems to be doing in Europe.</P>
    <P>We have to work from the basic tenet that this plan will not work for Ireland, for Irish farming or for the Irish economy and that its publication is a major crisis for us.  The last thing we need for Irish farming is a redundancy package, and <Col N="1468" /> that, effectively, is what is being proposed. Likewise, we do not need a complacent Minister for Agriculture and Food, as the Minister has been in relation to these negotiations.  The words that have gone out from here this morning will offer little consolation to our farming community.  Our own spokesperson, Deputy Kavanagh, warned the Minister more than once on the impending farm price package.  On every occasion he did so, the Minister insisted that that was not the occasion to respond.  We had to wait until after the Commission made their announcements.  Unfortunately, we have seen how that strategy has failed, given the direct announcement from Commissioner MacSharry last night.  I am sure the farming community themselves will remember the promises made quite recently by the Taoiseach in the course of the local elections, to use his words, he was going to &ldquo;bang the table&rdquo; at the Luxembourg Summit.  He was going to ensure that our concerns about the future of our largest industry were known and understood at the highest levels in Europe.  They will not need reminding about how he clapped himself on the back on his return from that summit, telling us that all these issues had been put firmly on the European agenda.</P>

      <P>I always respond to the Chair, and I will stay in order.  An aspect of this debate which seems to have been lost completely relates to the serious starvation problems that exist.  I do not have enough time but I want to put on the record of the House the serious position in relation to the Third World, which did <Col N="1470" /> not even warrant a mention by Commissioner MacSharry.  This matter should be addressed in the context of the reform package and the proposals that are now in place in relation to the CAP.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is destined to take a hammering. The Government have not been successful in dealing with agriculture. They have slashed the budget of Teagasc to the bone and have presided over the debacle of the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes.  The Government have talked a lot about agriculture but unfortunately have done very little.  I regret that the Minister has not been able to bring about the legislative changes he spoke of when we discussed hormones and angel dust or devil dust.  It is a matter of regret that the Minister was not able to find time to bring those issues before the House because people who are causing massive damage to Irish agriculture are still walking away from our courts.

      <P>As has been previously pointed out, the gist of the proposals has <Col N="1471" /> been well known for some time, and on that basis The Workers' Party have carried out an analysis of the position. Whereas it is not possible to go into every detail of the proposals issued last evening there is no doubt that the consequences of the package of reforms announced by Commissioner MacSharry will be very serious for Irish agriculture.  On the other hand, the consequences of not facing up to the need for fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will be even more serious not just for agriculture but for the Irish economy and the entire European Community.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party have been pointing out for several years now that the writing was on the wall for the CAP and it was time to look for alternative structures for agriculture.  Yet successive Governments and the main farming organisations have failed to face up to reality and have tried to fight an unwinnable battle to preserve CAP spending at its current level.  Commissioner MacSharry has shown that he is prepared to bite the bullet, and we have to face up to that.  A farming policy which produces goods for which there is no market, which adds up to £15 per week to consumers' food bills, which consumes up to 60 per cent of the entire EC budget and which allows 80 per cent of all price supports to go to the top 20 per cent income bracket has no future and is not worth fighting for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard to understand that a person with a quota of 100,000 gallons of milk could get a hand-out of £35,000 while his neighbouring farmers are starved because they do not have sufficient land to increase their quota.  It is about time that system was ended.  We must at the same time take into consideration the fact that the producer of 35,000 or 40,000 gallons of milk cannot afford to take a 3 per cent cut in production.  That person will have to lease his quota and will use some of his profits to pay for that quota. That should be taken on board.  If the emphasis is placed on that producer a structure could be developed whereby people who want to remain on the land will have some chance of doing so.  On <Col N="1472" /> the question of land acquisition, there must be a policy to enable people to acquire and lease land so that they will have a sufficient quota to provide them with a sustainable standard of living on the land.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the theory, the intervention system in practice is simply unacceptable. If there was a long-established industry in this country employing thousands of workers, producing for instance, a particular type of car for which there was no longer a market, and in order to protect the jobs of the workers the Government or the EC decided to buy up the surplus cars, so many cars had to be bought that the country ran out of storage space and had to hire ships to store the cars offshore, just imagine the outcry there would be over the waste of public money and the demands to halt this wasteful practice.  Yet this is the story of Irish agriculture after almost 20 years of EC membership.  There were no more enthusiastic advocates of Irish membership of the EC than the farming organisations, who promised that the whole country would benefit from the access of Irish agriculture to CAP funds.  Almost two decades later, despite the very substantial transfer of funds, the agricultural sector's net contribution to GNP remains unchanged; the numbers obtaining a living from farming have declined by 40 per cent and the number at work in the food industry has declined by nearly one-third, from 46,000 to 33,000.</P>
    <P>Ireland accounts for only a very small proportion of total Community agricultural production, but is one of the biggest users of the intervention system. As of May last, this country accounted for almost 40 per cent of total skim milk powder held in intervention by the Community. We produce about 5 per cent only of the Community's butter but account for around 30 per cent of intervention stocks.  Almost 25 per cent of total beef held in intervention is Irish. We have the totally immoral spectacle of families &mdash; farming families among them &mdash; being unable to put adequate food on the table for their children, while two South American ships are anchored in <Col N="1473" /> Cork harbour with tens of thousands of tonnes of butter deteriorating in their holds.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, a Community wide problem.  There are other products in intervention in the other EC countries in respect of which Ireland accounts for very little, such as cereals, wine, pigmeat, tobacco and olive oil, in respect of which we do not feature at all.</P>
    <P>Any agricultural policy &mdash; at national or Community level &mdash; should be assessed on how it measures up to certain objectives: to provide a good quality, varied and adequate supply of food as cheaply as possible; to enable the land to provide the maximum number of families possible with decent incomes and to increase its overall contribution to the economy in terms of income generated and employment created; to do so in a manner that preserves, so far as is practicable, the environment and ensures that the countryside is preserved as a leisure resource available to the entire Community; to take account of the need to support the development of the Third World economies, for whom agricultural production and exports is of such importance; and to provide raw material of sufficient quality, quantity and regular availability as is necessary to maximise the efficiency and potential for development of downstream industries in processing, marketing, etc.</P>
    <P>The reality of the Common Agricultural Policy is very different.  It costs a fortune to run &mdash; up to 60 per cent of the entire Community's budget, almost £25 billion in 1991.  Its complicated structure invites waste, inefficiency and fraud. In 1989 it cost something approaching £2.5 billion simply to store intervention stocks.  The value of those stocks depreciated by around £1.8 billion over the year.  It takes an army of civil servants, inspectors and other unnecessary bureaucrats to operate, manage and police it.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that between increased food prices and additional taxes it costs the average family around £700 per year. Much of the CAP spending is absorbed by various commodity traders and other <Col N="1474" /> middlemen.  Of the amount going to farmers, 80 per cent goes to the top 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The obvious waste and huge cost of the CAP has been successfully used, particularly by the UK, to block the development of other common policies by the Community in areas where they are clearly necessary.  In any event, it leaves little of the Community budget for anything else.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the EC support prices are 20 per cent higher than they need to be in order to keep efficient farmers in business.  In theory they are subsidised by this additional amount in order to protect the incomes of the smaller farmers.  However, since it is a subsidy to production, the most efficient benefit disproportionately and, year by year, there are fewer farmers and farms get bigger. Thus, while average farm incomes and the real gross income of the industry falls, that of the most efficient usually increases and consequently what was supposed to have been an exercise in social solidarity has actually seen a further widening of the income gap between large farmers and small landowners.  Several studies have shown that the CAP is a much less efficient mechanism for getting subsidies to their targets than either the Regional or Social Funds.</P>
    <P>The drive for increased intensive production provoked by the CAP has been doubly damaging to the environment because of the consumption of resources and the pollution caused by waste. Against this background, it is not surprising that there has been a growing realisation that the CAP cannot be allowed to drift on in its present chaotic state.  The Workers' Party have long recognised it; Commissioner MacSharry recognises it now.</P>
    <P>While there are many details which still need to be clarified, the main drift of the MacSharry proposals seems to be a step in the right direction providing as it does, a step away from incentives to over-production, chiefly by the big producers, and towards targeting spending on smaller and poorer producers.  What seems to <Col N="1475" /> have been overlooked is that the MacSharry plan actually provides for a substantial increase in CAP spending, bringing it from around £26 billion to around £29 billion.  What reasonable person can object to more money being spent and more efficiently targeted, especially when it is likely to lead to cheaper prices for consumers and less wasteful production?</P>
    <P>The proposals for direct income support rather than subsidies on production are particularly welcome and should be of real value to the smaller farmers who need them most.  We must ensure that the overall level of EC support for Irish agriculture is maintained to at least existing levels so that the overall Irish economy will be cushioned against the immediate effects of the proposals.</P>
    <P>The MacSharry proposals are only part of what must be an ongoing process of reassessment of agricultural policy at both EC and national level.  In many respects the problems of agriculture are similar to the overall problems of the peripheral regions.  The problems must be approached in a similar way.  Direct payments to smaller farmers can only be a temporary arrangement, and neither is there any long term value in protecting low paying, inefficient industries.</P>
    <P>The existing Structural Funds must be retained, although to do their job properly the funds available need to be substantially increased.  Any decrease in CAP spending in Ireland in the longer term must be compensated for by an increase in Structural Funds.  There must be a shift away from intensive production in favour of organic methods of production. The demand for organic food products is likely to continue to grow. Such a shift could be particularly beneficial to Irish agriculture and other less developed regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>There needs to be a shift, as part of an interventionist industrial policy, of higher paid, value added, high technology industries from the cramped centre to the less developed regions.  There needs to be a specific programme for direct investment in and development of industries based <Col N="1476" /> on the natural resources indigenous to the peripheral and largely agricultural regions.  The Community must assist with the reorienting of agricultural production to fit in with industry.  Support must be provided for diversification into the production of non-surplus food and other non-food products.</P>
    <P>I studied the proposals in the Leader programme and I do not think one can disagree with the proposal that the major adjustments in rural economies have been the cause of concern at EC level for some time.  The report referred to mounting food surpluses and falling farm incomes which are leading to a serious questioning of the continuation of the Common Agricultural Policy.  An integrated approach is required to the continued development of the rural economy.  The Leader programme, if properly implemented and the advice given to farming communities could lead to a policy for the future.</P>
    <P>At home the priority for national agricultural policy must be to put the country's agricultural resources to their most productive possible use.  There is a need for a comprehensive plan to work towards this objective.  This plan should identify smaller farmers with development potential and provide them with the means to reach this potential.  Small farmers who do not wish to expand, who wish to remain in agriculture, should be encouraged to diversify into new areas, such as forestry and agri-tourism.  Farmers who do not see a future in farming should be allowed to retire with dignity or to move into new careers with their land being reallocated to developing farmers, through sale or lease.  However, the proposal in this regard is ambiguous and should be clarified.  Farmers who want to leave the land should be properly advised at a very early stage.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, there is a strong case for diverting much of the CAP funding which currently goes to bigger farms to the Structural Funds, with the specific aim of creating new job opportunities in rural areas, for those wishing to diversify or move out of farming altogether.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> The ultimate aim of agricultural policy should be to create a core of commercial farms which can compete successfully in the more open markets which will result from reduced CAP funding.  These farms should be capable of giving their owners a reasonable living while also supplying food at reasonable prices to consumers.</P>
    <P>A new breed of farmer is required who can afford to look beyond tomorrow and take the long term requirements of the sector into account.  There are at the moment too many quick buck merchants in the industry who are prepared to sacrifice all our futures in their own short-term interests.  The scandalous failure to control bovine TB and the alarming spread of the use of angel dust are but two indicators of this cancerous element in the Irish farming community.  We need a farm policy which can, and will, mercilessly weed out these people.</P>
    <P>We also need a farm population more committed to the long term development of markets for high value Irish food products. We can no longer afford an industry which is happy to feed animals on summer grass and sell into intervention in the autumn.  Because of the seasonal nature of the industry &mdash; this was referred to earlier &mdash; cereal imports should be very carefully looked at.  We should also look at the seasonal nature of our production. Why was there not a policy to extend production to the winter season? Why were workers let go from factories in which large amounts of State funds were invested?  We should have a system where milk will be produced in the winter.  It would have been easy to do this but there was no effort to implement it.  I am very concerned about the cereal substitution imports allowed because they could affect the industry.</P>
    <P>Agricultural policy needs to develop a farmer controlled meat processing sector with individual farmers committed to supplying plants which they own and control themselves.  While the dairy sector has developed well on this model, the meat sector remains characterised by anarchy, with factories opening and closing, and firms coming and going, with bewildering regularity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> The Workers' Party call for the establishment of an agriculture and food development authority analagous to the Industrial Development Authority.  This authority would bring the various interest groups involved in Irish agriculture together in order to hammer out an agreed long-term plan for the industry. Broad goals would be set for the different sectors, and specific goals within each sector.  Assistance to producers and processors would only be provided to the extent to which they were prepared to meet agreed targets in terms of quantity and quality of output, and to the extent that long-term supply linkages were established between producers and processors. All involved would have to contribute towards funding both scientific research geared to the industry's needs and the development of stable markets for Irish food products.</P>
    <P>The Irish agricultural sector can have a prosperous future in the context of more open European and world markets.  We have basic advantages relating to soil, climate and, above all, a reputation for a clean environment.  Many more off-farm jobs can be created on the basis of an efficient farm sector.  These goals will not come about if the various elements are left to their own devices.  There is a need for dynamic political and developmental leadership from the State to knock heads together, get things moving, sort out the chaff and create a sense of unity and purpose behind a programme of reorganisation and reform for a better future for us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity of contributing to this vital debate.  There is no doubt that the proposed reform of the CAP and the current GATT negotiations are a major event in the agricultural calendar.  The matters involved will take up most of the time of the Government and the Department of Agriculture and Food for the reminder of this year.  It is vital to have this debate because the outcome in both cases will significantly influence the direction which agriculture and the whole economy will take in the next couple of years.</P>
      <P>As the Minister informed the House earlier, the Commission yesterday finalised the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals and the real debate on the vital issue for Ireland is about to start. I should like to think that the real fight will be in Europe by the Government and the Department at the Council of Ministers in association with farming organisations and of partners under the social and economic programme.</P>
      <P>The most discerning aspect of the proposals is that they rely almost exclusively on the cereal and livestock sectors to effect reform.  Of course, those are the areas of activity that are the most important in Irish agriculture.  The Government will, of course, have to study the proposals in all their detail, including the compensatory and structural elements, before arriving at a definitive position. As I said, and I give an undertaking to the House, in all of this we will be maintaining close and regular contact with all of the appropriate interests, farming organisations and social partners so that our approach will be fully informed and balanced, taking account of the requirements of the agriculture and food sectors and, indeed, the entire economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any adjustments to existing market mechanisms must be limited to what is strictly warranted by market or budgetary requirements, and any change in <Col N="1480" /> policy must continue to respect the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy and, in particular, Community preference. Ireland's vital agricultural interests will have to be appreciated by the other Community countries and the Commission.  The Government will have to insist on the fullest safeguards being provided for the future of all categories of Irish farmers.  Those will be the underlying principles of Ireland's negotiating stand.</P>
    <P>We will insist on a Community policy on agriculture which will respect and safeguard the vital national interests of agriculture and the entire economy.  I do not intend to spell that out in any more detail now, because that has been done already by the Minister and by each of the contributors to the debate from the other parties.  I see no difficulty in there being a combined and completely unified approach to this absolutely crucial matter.</P>
    <P>As well as the proposed reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the present GATT round of negotiations is gathering momentum.  It is vital that both the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals and the GATT round be taken in tandem and that the Irish position be maintained, that because we are so dependent on agriculture and food any measures that would negatively affect that industry would have far-reaching repercussions for our entire economy.</P>
    <P>I am glad there is now growing acceptance by the participants in the GATT round that the Community will not tolerate the singling out of agriculture for particular attention, because this is most important for Ireland.  At the same time, demands continue to be made for further Community concessions on agriculture. Obviously we need to maintain the stoutest fight there to safeguard and protect our interests.</P>
    <P>To reiterate the position, our principal objective must be to ensure that the GATT round outcome does not undermine the Common Agricultural Policy, to that end we have been insisting, and <Col N="1481" /> will continue to do so, that any commitments should be coherent and consistent with the basic principles of the Common Agricultural Policy.  That will underline our position in relation to both areas of negotiation, the GATT round and the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, also be necessary to ensure that the reforms which will ultimately be agreed and the changes emanating from the GATT round will not militate against the continued development of a competitive and modern agri-food industry.  Such a modern industry will be essential if we are to move to greater market orientation &mdash; an inevitable consequence of both Common Agricultural Policy reform and the GATT negotiations.  As Minister with special responsibility for the food industry, I have particular interest in the implications of CAP reform and the GATT negotiations for the area.</P>
    <P>The Government attach the utmost importance to the development of the agri-food industry, and Government policy throughout the past number of years has been clearly directed towards investment and restoring confidence in the food industry.  The fact that £117 million has been directly invested in the food industry since 1987 is an indication of the enormous potential that the Government sees in the proper development of this industry.</P>
    <P>The present position regarding CAP and the GATT negotiations is that proposals are on the table and the serious negotiation is about to commence.  I would assume that those negotiations will continue for a number of months and that it will probably be towards the end of the year before any agreement is reached.</P>
    <P>There is a tough, tenacious and determined fight to be carried out in Brussels. I am certain that with the co-operation of all interested parties the importance of agriculture to Ireland will be recognised and there will not be a negative outcome to these negotiations that would seriously affect the development of our most important industry.</P>
    <P>The industry, of course, must gear <Col N="1482" /> itself to meet the challenges of the marketplace.  The Government have been saying &mdash; and I have been saying personally for several years now &mdash; that it is all very well to call on the Government to do various things, but the industry itself has several actions to take in the whole agriculture and food area.  It will certainly have to move away from the idea of using intervention as a permanent outlet for production.  The Government keep on saying that and we will continue to say it because it is a fact of life.</P>
    <P>Dairying is the cornerstone of the agricultural industry.  Again, dairy farmers have faced a severe decline in income in the past year and a half or so.  It is appropriate now that the industry be examined in the context of the negotiations. Our marketeers will just have to take a lead from the better aspects of the marketing of agricultural products and try to emulate our most successful ventures. For example, Ireland has been most successful in the marketing of Kerrygold butter on the German market. If that case study were to be taken out, read and reread, studied and restudied and used as a model by other marketeers they would find out how that operation succeeded and premium return farmers received.  Anyone who has attended the Anuga food fairs or the Berlin Green Week would have noted that the dominant dairy product on the supermarket shelves was Irish butter.  Not only that but they would also have noted that it was the dominant product carrying a major premium in its price, sometimes up to about 30 per cent.  The best of marketing skills have been illustrated in that operation and I certainly recommend that our food industry marketeers in general study that operation.  Good marketing operations certainly make a great deal more sense than the loading of tonnes of butter or skim milkpowder on to articulated trucks bound for intervention storage. That makes no sense at all.  It is even more ridiculous now in the context of these reforms and in the context of 1992. It is time for the industry to confront that problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> The future prosperity of the whole agricultural industry will undoubtedly be under threat if heavy dependence on intervention continues. The key factor in the strategy for the successful expansion of the agricultural industry is the development of quality food and beverage products, the importance of which I have continually emphasised.  This is because I am convinced that attention to quality is absolutely essential to succeed in the intensely competitive international market.  It is no use saying that we have the greenest island in Europe, that we have environmental attributes that are comparable with any other country or that we are the greatest.  Consumers will judge whether or not we are the greatest based on the quality and competitiveness of price at which we can make our products available.  There is no other way.</P>
    <P>From the farm to the palate we must ensure that our products not alone meet the minimum requirements for food safety and health but we must assure our customers, the market place and our supermarkets, that in relation to health, safety and quality, in relation to the absence of any kind of deleterious material whether it is angel dust, additives or preservatives, Irish food products measure up to what we claim for them. This new culture of quality has to permeate the entire industry, the co-operatives, the farmers, the factories and the semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>When I was appointed Minister not one food firm here measured up to international quality standards.  Now 31 firms, with 20 further firms pending, have attained that standard.  Additionally, 70 Irish companies have attained the quality mark operated by the Irish Quality Association.  Again, in recent times CBF have been to the forefront in their quality assurance programmes in relation to pig meat and pork.  Only a week ago a quality assurance scheme was initiated and launched by Minister O'Kennedy in the beef area.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by those developments because there has been a great deal <Col N="1484" /> of taxpayers' and FEOGA investment in state of the art factories and equipment. We have excellent graduates throughout the industry.  We have very important marketing programmes and European orientation programmes.  I regularly meet young Irish graduates on the Continent who are doing post graduate work in marketing.  There is in place the potential, as never before, to exploit our agriculture industry.  If we do it right and take it seriously I have no doubt we will succeed.</P>
    <P>However, we must have the climate and the environment right.  That is why the proposals regarding the reform of the CAP and the GATT round are so worrying and why we are extremely concerned about them.  There is no use in Irish farmers working themselves to the bone if they have not the opportunity to market their produce on the shelves in the European Community.  There is no use in being told that there is a market of 350 million people if we have not a chance of producing for it.  If we have not this Community preference, this cornerstone of the CAP and the Treaty of Rome, we will get nowhere.  In a nutshell, what we are looking for is the opportunity to be the best in Europe.  We must ensure that the negotiations on the CAP and the GATT round do not result in agreements which in any way interfere with the proper development of our farming and food industry.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, we are satisfied that, with a unified approach by farming organisations, and by all sectors in Ireland, behind the Government's stand, there will be a satisfactory outcome to these negotiations.  If this occurs Ireland can proceed to capitalise on our undoubted advantages in food production and processing and become the quality supplier of European food.  Provided we gear ourselves properly and have the proper mental approach to farming, processing, marketing and promotion we can and will succeed in this task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words <Col N="1485" /> on what is probably the most important subject to come before Dáil Éireann in 25 years.  I am extremely worried at the defence the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister of State, are making of Ireland's stand on future negotiations. I thought they would have said they were unequivocally opposed to what is happening because it suits neither Irish farmers nor Ireland as a whole.  From what the Minister has said it would appear that he is weak-kneed and like a cork on the ocean, going everywhere as he has done.</P>
      <P>I forgot to mention when I started that I propose dividing my time with Deputy Nealon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>No fewer than 30 Fine Gael Deputies wanted to speak on this topic, for obvious reasons.  We would need a three day debate for that but we have been asked to cut our contributions. My contribution will last about ten minutes.</P>
      <P>The day the US Secretary for Agriculture, Clayton Yeutter, arrived in Dromoland Castle over a year ago will be remembered as the blackest day Irish agriculture has known since the emergency days in the thirties.  The meeting was organised ostensibly to allow face-to-face negotiations take place between Clayton Yeutter, wearing his GATT hat, and Commissioner MacSharry on behalf of ten million EC farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us remember the background.  The Americans wanted a short sharp conclusion to the GATT round of talks.  They said, and many commentators in Ireland believed them, that no decision had been taken and, if a decision was not taken before the end of the year 1990, it would be a catastrophe, that not alone would EC and Irish farmers suffer but world trade would be crippled.  No decision was taken before December 1990 nor has a decision been taken yet and world trade did not collapse.  World trade will not collapse.  The American tactic was to pressurise the EC into whipping its CAP <Col N="1486" /> into line so that European prices would fall to world levels.  If this had happened, without doubt there would have been a very successful outcome to the GATT negotiations in Geneva for the Americans but it would have spelled disaster for Irish farmers and many European farmers. Many industrial countries in the EC are very happy with what is happening.</P>
    <P>I condemn Commissioner MacSharry for committing a major tactical error on that day one year ago in Dromoland Castle by announcing a 30 per cent reduction in Community aid to European farmers.  The Americans knew on their way to that conference that this initiative was on the cards.  With a voluntary proposal of 30 per cent cuts in farm price supports under their belts, and without one single minute of negotiating time expended, the Americans knew that their worldwide industrial influence would work wonders on European agriculture. As we know, New Zealand and Canada were delighted but Irish farmers were shocked.</P>
    <P>The European dream, as far as Irish agriculture is concerned, is well and truly shattered.  The founding fathers of the EC correctly identified Irish agriculture as the single most valuable industry and also the most difficult industry to rationalise. Many vitally important matters relating to agriculture have been forgotten in the mists of time.</P>
    <P>Ask Irish farmers about their experiences as late as the sixties when we were fettered to the UK market.  Trying to negotiate with a country that always pursued a cheap food policy was bad enough but, when other countries dumped their surplus products on the British market, prices just slumped here.</P>
    <P>I remember, as a young lad, listening to the farmers at fairs and marts in the early sixties.  The only item of important conversation was what the live cattle trade to the UK was like that week.  On several occasions the news would come through that there were too many cattle on offer at the sale in Banbury.  When this news reached the fairs in Mountbellew or Ballygar where I come from the cattle were walked home again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> I did not understand it at the time but people often said they could see the anxiety, disappointment and hardship written on the faces of the farmers. I do not want to be a carrier of bad news but what I have heard here today indicates that we are not too far away from a return to that situation.</P>
    <P>I recall this scenario to illustrate why Irish farmers reacted so positively in 1972 to join the EC.  The Common Agricultural Policy signalled that there was something better.  It seemed to provide two vital factors unavailable to Irish farmers for generations.  First, the CAP offered a guaranteed price for certain farm products and, second, it presented Irish farmers with the opportunity to trade on a much wider stage.</P>
    <P>From being tied to the UK market a new exciting market to service over 260 million people emerged.  If we were good enough we would do well &mdash; at least the opportunity had now presented itself. Did we do well?  Yes and no.  From a primary producer's point of view we did well.  We dramatically increased our output of beef, sheep, milk and, at times, cereals.  Yields increased dramatically, fertilisers and lime usage increased, new and better farm machines were purchased and, with some exceptions, there was a buzz in agricultural circles during the latter part of the seventies and early eighties.  But all was not well.  Farmers, listening to economists, forecasters, bankers, politicians and all types of advisers borrowed heavily, too heavily in many cases.  Thousands of farming families still have traces of the scars inflicted during that period.</P>
    <P>I hold the EC responsible for many of the problems associated with CAP. Farmers, generally, are producers of food and, depending on the region, will strive to grow more and better crops thus improving their financial position.  The EC planners allowed an intervention system to develop where some continental farmers could profitably keep 2,000 cows and 20,000 cattle without an animal ever eating a bite of grass in a field.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> Cheap cereal substitutes dumped into the port of Rotterdam presented factory farming with the raw material it required. The EC never raised a finger.  Politics within the EC and outside the Community ensured that the vital changes needed were not made.  The 40 acre Galway farmer was in direct competition with the Dutch factory farmer and now both of them will be in competition with the 2,000 acre American farmer.</P>
    <P>However, the EC committed another unpardonable blunder.  Farmers were encouraged to produce more.  No real effort was made to convert the extra produce into food products in demand by the housewives of Europe.  Dumping into intervention was a far too easy option both for farmers and food processors. Intervention was and always will be important to farmers but there should have been controls.  Many good food products never saw the light of day simply because there was far more money in selling into intervention.  There was no shortage of lip service to the concept of added value and the provision of new products.</P>
    <P>Now the EC has gone from one extreme to the other.  This worries me. The new proposals are draconian and, if implemented, will flush small farmers off the land and weaken commercial farmers to the point where they will not be able to compete with their counterparts, and we will have the worst of all worlds.  The part played by the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, is nothing short of disgraceful. The Minister has been weak kneed.  He does not have any view of his own as to where Ireland should go and we certainly do not have a strategy.</P>
    <P>However, the part played by the Fianna Fáil MEPs is bordering on national sabotage and is real hill-billy stuff.  They are the only group of politicians who can argue that if the value of farm products is reduced by over £500 million, 90 per cent of Irish farmers will be better off under the new proposals. Indeed, one of them, my colleague in Galway, Mark Killilea, had the audacity and neck to suggest that small farmers <Col N="1489" /> will be better off.  Their principal argument seems to be that farmers will be fully compensated for losses incurred in lower product prices.  What folly, what ignorance.</P>
    <P>If the EC intended to fully compensate farmers for loss of product prices the EC budget would remain as it is.  This is not the intention.  I will spell out exactly what MEPs Killilea and Lane are trying to convey.  Take 1989 farm price levels and a 70 acre farmer totally dependent on farming to support his family.  He has a milk quota of 20,000 gallons from 25 cows, rears his calves to one and a half years and has a sheep flock of 50 ewes. By Irish standards he is a well stocked farmer.</P>
    <P>Let us take a quick look at what happened this farmer in 1990 compared to 1989.  On milk he lost 18p per gallon or £3,600, on his 17 weanlings he lost £120 per head or £2,040 and his 60 lambs and wool sold for £870 less than the previous year.  This farmer's income was reduced by £6,150 in 1990.  His disposable income in 1989 was £9,500.  Like many other well stocked farmers this man had no option but to invest in a slatted house to control farmyard pollution.  Despite the new grant of 50 per cent he had to borrow over £15,000 and is repaying it at the rate of £1,500 per year.  After all expenses, this farmer had £30 per week to rear his family before Commissioner MacSharry and the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, got at him this morning.  All the indications are that incomes will drop by another 8 to 10 per cent this year.  If I am right, the bottom will fall out of the cattle trade.  One has only to look at the marts of Ireland over the last 14 days to know that there is a tragedy on the way.  In some cases farmers will get 25 per cent less than they got last year for cattle.</P>
    <P>What compensation will the 70 acre farmer get from the new package?  First, there is the famous headage payment.  A good number of farmers here already get headage payments, so that will not make any difference.  Others are being brought in some time and they will get the maximum £872.  In my part of the country the beef premium can be collected once <Col N="1490" /> only, although it will be paid for three years on the same animal because farmers cannot hold the animal for three years.  Basically there is little extra there. Because a farmer holds nine animals he would get an advantage of £162 only on the beef premium.  The farmer, by and large, has lost £6,000 and he will get £1,200.  Will the Minister tell me where the cream is for him?</P>

      <P>My father was a small farmer in the west as were all his neighbours and practically everyone else who was working on the land in Sligo, Leitrim and Mayo.  A knowledgeable man at that time could name all the big farmers in the three counties, mainly the big houses with walled estates.  There is little change today.  There has been some doubling and trebling up of small holdings as the occasion arose following a death without an heir or a deparature on an emigrant boat.  The Land Commission also helped in this restructuring.  As we reach the end of the century this is still essentially unbroken small family territory in comparison to Leinster or Munster, not to mention the US with which the small farmers of the west oddly find themselves in conflict through the machinations of GATT.</P>
      <P>Deputies from the west frequently have great difficulty in putting across the message of just how small these farms are or how tough a task farming is for small farmers.  The reality is that in recent years the small farmer who relies solely on his land for an income has been living pretty close to the poverty line.  Indeed some farmers keep their farms rather than the farms keeping them.  An official survey issued by Teagasc shows that many farmers have a negative income.  However, in spite of all of this, the image of all farmers as a privileged species with big cars and fat wallets still persists.  The only thing farmers in the west have in abundance is beautiful scenery which, as everyone knows, makes very poor collateral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the small farmers in my constituency and indeed throughout the west this century has been a failing battle for survival.  They have tried to stick with farming, continue the tradition into <Col N="1491" /> which they were born, hold onto the family farm and keep the smoke coming from the chimneys of their houses. Unfortunately, thousands of small farmers have found this to be an unequal struggle.  The only respite they have had from this constant battle &mdash; ironic in view of the proposals we are discussing today &mdash; came from the CAP in the seventies. This led to an improvement for small farmers at that time.  They had hope, expanded their farms and at night asked God to bless Mark Clinton. However, the good times did not last long.  Naturally the first thing many farmers did with the extra money they received was to improve their spartan living conditions.  Who could blame them for doing that?  They then proceeded with vigour to expand their dairy herds from five, six and seven to 14, 15 or 20 cows. However, in the course of this expansion in deference to EC policies and promises, they were caught by the quotas, despite the efforts of Deputy Austin Deasy to gain a few extra years in the reckoning. The only means by which farmers could make a decent living on a small farm through expanding their dairy herds was cut off.  The average herd size in north Connacht, particularly in counties Sligo and Mayo, is 11 or 12 cows.  In recent years all farmers have been getting from the Commission is a restrictive price policy and a dilution of the CAP.  This policy is now failing in its primary obligation to provide small farm families with a reasonable income.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to the national figures.  Over the past 18 months the cut in the price of milk has taken £10 million from the pockets of dairy farmers in the Sligo-Leitrim area and the local economy.  The so-called reform measures now propose to cut the price of milk by a further 9p per gallon. This will lead to a further loss of £3 million-£4 million to the supplies in this area. Over the past four years, 20 per cent of the dairy farmers in this area have given up the unequal struggle and got out of milk production.  What will happen if a further 20 per cent, 30 per cent or 40 per <Col N="1492" /> cent go out of milk production?  Where will these farmers go?  The only alternative I can see for them is the totally ineffective agri-business.</P>
    <P>The returns in the beef sector are even worse.  The price of forward store cattle, the essence of the market in my area, has fallen by £75 a head in one year.  Farmers have been told not to worry, that they will be compensated.  However, the compensation now on offer would mean a net loss of between £40 and £50 a cow. In addition, the compensation will be paid on one cow only per 1.4 acres.  This proposal reveals the true intention of the thinkers behind the CAP reform proposals, that is, force the farmers of the west out of business.  We were assured there would be no quota cuts below 43,000 gallons.  I should like to ask the Minister if there is an assurance that there would be no quota cuts below 43,000 gallons, and if it is true, why is the word &ldquo;linear&rdquo; used in this connection?  This would seem to indicate that suppliers under 43,000 gallons are targeted for proportionate cuts.</P>
    <P>Compensation will also be paid in the beef area.  However, there are so many conditions attached to this that it will be impossible for small farmers who traditionally keep animals for the winter and sell off grass the following October to get maximum benefit.  There is no way such farmers can make the massive investments needed for environmental as well as farming purposes.</P>
    <P>The threat posed by the reform of the CAP to the future of the family farms in the west, whatever about anywhere else, is the greatest since the famine.  The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy portends the end of small farming structures and communities as we know them and the closing of the farm gates on farm production.  Of course, this will not happen all of a sudden; it will be a gradual process.  Compensation will be portrayed as covering all losses but it will amount to little more than a redundancy package for the last generation of small farmers. These farmers want to stay in farming but they want to see their incomes coming from their farms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> The Minister for Agriculture and Food has a major crisis on his hands, the biggest he is ever likely to face, as he tries to re-establish the position so that family farms will have the opportunity of earning reasonable incomes from commercial activities.  My colleague, Deputy Paul Connaughton, referred to headage payments. Under the proposals in the budget, I calculate that a man who got £400 last year in headage payments will get an extra £10 this year.  I calculated this on the basis of questions I asked last year in regard to the budgetary allowance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not been sufficiently aggressive to date in regard to the CAP reforms.  We may have got our information about what is happening in Brussels through leaks, counter-leaks or inspired leaks but now he knows the facts. I wish the Minister well in his negotiations. An important part of our tradition, our way of life and the west of Ireland as we know it rides with him in these negotiations.  We must not contemplate failure in these negotiations.</P>

      <P>This House has found it necessary on many occasions in the past to debate matters pertaining to the agricultural industry, but I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that never before has there been such genuine concern and fear about the future of Irish farmers, their families and the entire agricultural service industry.  In this debate we are not referring to the crisis in farming, the decline in farm incomes and the threat to the agricultural industry generally but also to the livelihoods of many thousands of people in the community who depend on the agricultural industry for their survival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened attentively to this debate.  Many references have been made to the importance of the family farm. <Col N="1494" /> Over the years our economy has been largely based on the development of family farms.  A large proportion of our workforce depends on agriculture for employment.  Tragically this number is now declining.  As I said, many businesses depend on agriculture for their survival.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the brief issued by farming organisations.  One of the most telling arguments in favour of agriculture was contained in the very simple comparative briefing document issued by the IFA.  This related to the size of the enterprise needed to maintain a family farm, relating it to the average industrial wage. I will give as an example the dairy farmer who is supposed to have the highest income so far as agricultural enterprise is concerned.  In 1989 23 dairy cows provided a comparative industrial wage for a farm family.  This increased to 40 cows in 1990 and to 57 cows this year.  There are not many family farms which can maintain and support a dairy herd of 57 cows.  I will give as another example the position of farmers in disadvantaged areas with single suckling cows.  In 1989 a farmer needed 109 acres in order to earn the average industrial wage.  This increased to 133 acres in 1990 and to 152 cows this year.</P>

However, it will be examined, as I said, in the first instance by the task force to see what results we might expect and then, of course, it will have to be considered because of its budgetary implications.

      <P>It is not a question but rather an irresponsible statement.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was a success recognised domestically and internationally.  Under that programme we created 70,000 extra jobs in the nonagricultural sector.  The present situation in regard to the unemployment figures is quite clearly, and this is provable, a result of population movements, migration and emigration, and not because of any decline in employment.  In fact, the present position is, as I have pointed out time and again in this House, that the increase in the number of unemployed is primarily due to the cessation of emigration. Both programmes contain a number of measures to increase employment. It is quite irresponsible to suggest that the Government are wasting their time in setting up a high powered, expert, skilled and experienced task force to help and advise them in this regard.</P>

      <P>Deputies are using Question Time to try to spread doom and gloom and create a completely negative atmosphere about the economy.  The Irish economy is in very good shape and is quite capable when international circumstances improve of providing an <Col N="1500" /> increasing number of jobs.  That is our target.  The whole purpose of the two programmes is to create the sort of economy that can grow and develop and provide jobs.  It happens that in this year, because of a downturn in the international economy, we are undergoing adverse circumstances.  I would point out that the adverse circumstances we are encountering are being experienced all over Europe and other countries to a far greater extent than here.  I cannot see why Deputy Rabbitte, among others, should criticise the positive initiative we are taking in setting up a task force of experienced industrialists and commercial people to look at the position and see why we have not succeeded in transferring economic growth into employment.  That is a legitimate economic question.  We have been getting average growth of 4.5 per cent and we want to know why we have not succeeded as yet in turning that growth into more employment than we have been generating. The task force can help us to examine that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 8 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the ESRI report, <i>Education, Employment and Training in the Youth Market.</i> The report contains a very good analysis of the workings of the Irish youth labour market particularly as regards the way educational qualifications can affect young people's labour market experiences and performance.</P>
      <P>The findings of the report bear out a message I have repeatedly delivered in this House and elsewhere &mdash; namely, that the positive link between qualifications and employment is well established and that young persons entering the labour market without qualifications are dealing themselves a very poor hand in relation to their prospects of securing meaningful, worthwhile employment.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the study found that the higher the level of educational qualifications the better the chance of getting a job and the better the labour market record the better the prospects of further employment.  Conversely, the longer a job seeker remained unemployed the smaller the chances of finding employment.</P>
      <P>The study indicates that young unemployed people who receive training significantly improve their prospects of getting work; training improves their chances of employment by 250 per cent and not 20 per cent, as originally misinterpreted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report noted that not everyone who leaves school without qualifications is trapped in a vicious circle of low-grade work followed by a period of unemployment: some, in fact, escape but they <Col N="1505" /> are unlikely to do so without help and support.</P>
    <P>This is the basis for State intervention in favour of unemployed young people. Since the cut-off date for the data used in the report, the Government have launched the Youthreach Programme for unqualified school leavers.</P>
    <P>Youthreach provides special education and training courses for up to two years duration to help the unqualified gain a better foothold in the labour market and to prevent their further marginalisation in society.  The teachers and instructors involved do sterling work, often in difficult circumstances, in providing further education and training courses specially geared to the needs of participants.  In 1990 a total of 2,660 unqualified school leavers participated in the Youthreach Programme.  These positive developments on the youth labour market would not have been taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Government accept that Youthreach is not the complete answer and that earlier intervention is needed.  The ESRI report stresses this point, noting that labour market interventions are probably insufficient to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>Research suggests that early school leaving is prompted by poor performance in school often arising from a combination of factors, including lack of support from parents who had left school without qualifications.  In order to break this vicious cycle the Minister for Education has already embarked on a campaign to improve links between home and school.  In the new school year, 80 schools will employ teachers full time in contacting parents to get them actively involved in working with the school for their children's sake.  The forthcoming Green Paper on Education will address this issue in greater detail.</P>
    <P>FÁS have welcomed the improved information on how young people get on in the labour market and will carefully study the report's conclusion.</P>
    <P>For my part I will take the findings fully into consideration in the preparation of the White Paper on Manpower Policy which I hope to publish later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  A point clearly made in this report is that a policy which allots to post-school interventions the responsibility for fitting a large number of young people into the mainstream of the labour market implicitly devalues the role of the educational system.  Will the Minister agree that the problems in this area cannot be resolved simply by post-school training schemes and apprenticeship schemes and that it requires a completely new approach not just by his Department but by his Department in conjunction with the Department of Education? Will he also agree that urgent consideration should be given to raising the school leaving age to 18 years to ensure all young people complete a full second cycle within the school system? Will he further agree that for that to be valuable there is a need for a greater vocational element in the post-primary education system to ensure more young people come out of school with qualifications and do not have to seek places on apprenticeship or FÁS schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government and the last Government have acknowledged that.  Since 1987 we have been considering both second and third levels.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there are nearly 9,000 extra places created in third level education and, on top of that, a great number of extra places have been created over the last four academic years in second level education.  I acknowledge what Deputy Shatter says.  This report which was commissioned by my Department traces these 1,100 people through the years and shows clearly that it is far better for people to stay in second level or third level education and that the State schemes are useful in some areas, like apprenticeship, where a person wants to follow a definite line.  In the normal training schemes it is far better that people get training within the education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I set up Youthreach in 1988 and I acknowledged then, and do so again, that that is a response to an inadequacy in the education system that is losing these <Col N="1507" /> people.  Youthreach is there only to pick up people who have dropped out.  I think the Green Paper on education will address the issue of disadvantage further as well as some of the other problems mentioned.</P>
    <P>There are some other interesting points in the report that are extremely important for young people to take account of. I welcome the fact that these points have been highlighted in the media, but it is clear that the figures used in the labour force survey in the last few years are correct.  The longer a person stays in education the better his or her chances of gaining long-term employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that both he and his Department have a direct input into the Green Paper on educational policy and that specific suggestions are made by his Department on the manner in which our current post-primary educational system and courses should change to meet the needs of particular young people who may not have academic skills but who have other skills that could be enhanced in post-primary education?  Will he agree that part of the problem in this area is the departmentalisation of the problem where there is a diversity of responsibilities within different Government Department areas?  Finally, will the Minister accept that the problem needs not just a change of attitude on the part of parents, but requires Government action which will make it part and parcel of our society that children will stay at school later? That means increasing the compulsory school going age to 17 or 18 years.  Will he also accept that without that we will not be able to resolve the problems of unskilled young people coming on the job market with no jobs available to them?</P>

      <P>My Department are <Col N="1508" /> already having discussions on the issues that affect the Department of Labour and training.  The school leaving age is a matter for the Department of Education. Through all the policies pursued by FÁS, which are my area of responsibility, we have agreed with, co-operated and coordinated our efforts with the education system, and indicated that before we would allow people on the Youthreach scheme, we would check with their schools that they had gone through the school system rather than what used to happen &mdash; maybe through nobody's fault &mdash; that a person would be attracted to a scheme because of the financial gain rather than the educational gain.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>
      <Quest>whether, in view of the recent upward trend in redundancies, he will hold discussions with the social partners to consider measures to reduce the level of redundancies by providing financial incentives for flexible voluntary work sharing options, having regard to the Labour Party's proposed work reorganisation scheme, 1989 (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Redundancy statistics have shown in the first six months of this year an increase compared with the same period in the previous year.  The figures for May and June 1991, however, show an improvement over those of recent years.  I should also add that the redundancy figures stabilised in 1989 and 1990 at about 13,000 as opposed to figures of the order of 30,000 in 1983 and 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to flexible voluntary work sharing, as I mentioned recently in reply to another parliamentary question, it is clear that the expansion of part-time employment, reduced working hours, job sharing and other proposals in that sphere, offer many advantages to certain groups in society, as well as contributing to the more efficient functioning of the labour market.  I feel, however, that the increased use of work sharing as a way <Col N="1509" /> of distributing available employment is primarily a matter for negotiation between employers and workers' representatives or individual employees.  In any consideration of work sharing, it is imperative that regard should be had to potential cost implications and to the need to improve the competitiveness of Irish goods and services internationally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that redundancies have been a major contributory factor to the present unemployment figures.  While it was a very good scheme, it has been abused by companies who were profitable and have used the scheme to increase profitability. That applies to both the private and public sectors.  Likewise companies who have been in receipt of major grant aid from the Government have shed jobs.  It is not in the context of the Minister's recent question of job sharing.  We are talking about something entirely different. We are talking about part-time work as an alternative to redundancies where a certain number of jobs would be available in a company and would be shared until there was a pick-up in business.  That is what I have in mind.  The Minister has evaded that.  Perhaps he will respond directly to that aspect of my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Over a number of years I have been very critical particularly of large firms who have used the redundancy scheme rather than diversifying into other industries.  I had a great debate in public with one major company in 1988 and I think they see the folly of the ways they followed.  However, I am not going to pursue that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have examined the proposals Deputy O'Sullivan has made available.  I would have some difficulty not with the concept but with the cost or feasibility of putting them into operation.  I am not saying the redundancy system is perfect but I do not believe there is any bonanza for people who are made redundant.  The proposal in Deputy O'Sullivan's position paper &mdash; which I welcome as an effort to <Col N="1510" /> do something constructive and I am not criticising the preparation of the document &mdash; would make the system more cumbersome and would involve financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>Let us say for the record that under the present system a person made redundant gets a half week's pay up to the age of 41, a full week for those years served over age 41 and an additional week.  By and large, it is not a bonanza for anyone. In the schemes mentioned in Deputy O'Sullivan's paper we would be talking about a week's pay for every year served over 25 years of age and five weeks' pay on top of that.  That would not do away with redundancy schemes.  In my reading of the document, if a company ran into difficulty even after the three year mandatory period provided in the document, a person would still use the redundancy scheme.  The Deputy also suggested that the rebate scheme be switched from the present 50 per cent to 65 per cent.  The difficulty is that someone has to pay and the social insurance fund would have to be reimbursed fairly massively to do that.  I see some wisdom in trying to convince people not to go the redundancy route, and I will continue to look at ways of doing that.  The Deputy's paper is a long one and I have studied it in detail. If he wishes I can give him my reply here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With a view to stemming the flood of redundancies and as a means of tackling the unemployment problem, it is necessary for us to conserve existing jobs.  We should try to prevent or at least discourage further redundancies. The Minister spoke in terms of a week's pay per year of service.  We have had the experience of companies paying up to nine week's wages for one year of service. This is the type of offer that workers cannot refuse.</P>

Maybe we should <Col N="1511" /> welcome the fact that a person will get a windfall after a number of years' service but effectively what is happening is that people are being encouraged to become redundant, and that is a much greater cost factor.  As regards the rebate system, it would be much better to pay 65 per cent and keep people at work rather than pay them social welfare.  It is with that in mind that the paper was drafted.</P>

      <Quest>when the proposed FIE-ICTU joint declaration on employee involvement in the private sector, which was promised under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, will be published; if he has had or plans to have any discussions with either the FIE-ICTU regarding the contents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The FIE-ICTU joint declaration on employee involvement in the private sector was published at the end of June.  The document outlines a range of possibilities for greater involvement by employees and will be widely circulated among employers and trade unions.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Labour I have always encouraged employee involvement and at the launch of the joint declaration I welcomed the FIE-ICTU initiative as a significant and timely development in this area.  The fact that the employer and trade union organisations are promoting a joint initiative gives a very strong signal to employers, unions and workers that employee involvement is the key to good industrial relations, and will encourage the development of participation arrangements on a more widespread basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the subject matter of this question might properly constitute one of the impediments in the way of job creation on which the task force under the review <Col N="1512" /> committee might focus, that Irish private industry has a very poor record in the matter of employee participation and that this is an impediment in the way of productivity, job creation, wealth creation and so on?  Does the Minister consider that it may be necessary to buttress, through legislation, any proposals that might be agreed by both sides of industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy Rabbitte.  Over the years there has been a lack of trust in some enterprises about exchanging information that is relevant to the day-to-day workings of the company and vital to the future of employees in Irish industry. Deputy Rabbitte will agree that, having regard to the failures of the sixties and seventies when this kind of initiative was tried and failed, including worker participation on which a working group reported in the late seventies, major progress has been made.  In 1988, with the support of all parties in the House, I introduced worker participation in the public sector.  Worker directors were appointed to 11 State boards and 35 semi-State boards plus a range of sub-board structures, and that was a step in the right direction.  In the private sector it may be necessary in the long term to introduce that practice but, if we followed the legislative path, everyone would have to be included and very little progress would be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint document, which I support, covers the matters that we would like to see followed up such as team briefing, suggestion schemes, open door management, employee reports, newsletters, magazines, video presentations, information on notice boards and so on.  These are the matters that are concentrated on in other countries which have introduced worker participation.  Both FIE and ICTU, at the most senior level, are telling their respective members that they consider important such issues as health and safety, changes in job design and work organisations, quality and cost improvement, plant layout, incentive schemes, employee assistance measures, equality, <Col N="1513" /> grading, recruitment and promotion. This is the first time we have made progress in this area.  The Productivity Council and Basil Chubb as Chairman of the Employer Labour Conference have been given responsibility for monitoring the implementation of the report, and we will proceed on that basis.</P>

      <P>The total number of redundancies notified to my Department in the first six months of 1991 was 8,337 compared with 6,840 for the corresponding period in 1990.  It is satisfactory to note that the increasing trend evident earlier this year has levelled off somewhat in the more recent months &mdash; the figure for June being substantially lower at 1,273 compared with 1,715 in March.  It should also be remembered that, in any comparison with last year's figures, the total in 1990 of 13,292 notified redundancies was the lowest annual figure since 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures the Minister has read out merely confirm the frightening underlying trend that has alarmed many people concerning worsening employment.  Is it the Minister's intention or the intention of the Government during the summer months to see whether there is any role for Government in intervening in this matter before we head into what will be a very bleak autumn and winter if the underlying trend now evident continues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has answered the second part of Deputy Rabbitte's question at great length today.  On the redundancy aspect, the figure for the first six months of the year is higher than for the first six months of last year which, as I have said, was the lowest for 11 or <Col N="1514" /> 12 years.  The figure is slightly above that for the first six months of 1989, 4,500 below the 1988 figure and 3,500 below the 1987 figure.  I am not saying that I am happy that there were 8,337 people redundant in the first six months of this year &mdash; I am sorry there is any redundancy &mdash; but I assure the Deputy that the Department of Labour will do everything they can to try to prevent redundancies by assisting companies in need, using enterprise schemes or employment subsidy schemes and considering new schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, based on the current trend, there is a danger that there will be more redundancies this year than new jobs created, and if that is not the case, that, at the very minimum, the number of new jobs created may be equal to the number of redundancies and therefore there will be no net increase in employment during the course of 1991?  This will keep our unemployment figure at the current level of 260,000 and increasing as we head into 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I would be unhappy if the level of redundancies continued at the same level as for the first six months of this year.  In the early months of the year the figure was 1,500 to 1,700 but it is now down to 1,200.  I hope we can sustain that figure or reduce it if at all possible.  I do not think the redundancy figure will equal the number of jobs created, but there is a negative factor.  Last year and the year before the redundancy figure was about 13,000, whereas in 1984 the figure was 31,000 and in 1983, 29,000 and any jobs created were being lost through redundancy.  The lower we can keep our redundancy figures the better for net job creation.  That is what we want to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

The PESP refers to 20,000 or 25,000 gross jobs, depending <Col N="1515" /> on how you read it, but the Minister for Finance has indicated that not more than 8,000 new jobs net will be created this year.

DÍON, on the basis of their assessment and analysis of the situation, determine their priorities, criteria and conditions for the grant of State aid.  The policy of successive Ministers for Labour has been not to interfere with DÍON's deliberations.</P>

Towards that end the committee have identified and published priority objectives for grant-aid purposes.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the figure of 28,000 people on these schemes gives a false picture of the true unemployment figures?  How many of those people will be in meaningful employment within, say, six months of completion of their courses?  Will the Minister agree that many of those schemes, particularly the social employment scheme, are make-work schemes <Col N="1517" /> and are there to massage the unemployment figures?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with anything the Deputy said.  Most of the people in training are young people who are in skills training and apprenticeship training and a high proportion of them obtain employment.  About 2,500 of them are on the Youthreach Programme. That is a more difficult group because from the outset we have not set the criteria of their ability to obtain jobs as part of the scheme.  The courses are there to help people.  By and large the work done by those on the social employment scheme is good for the environment and socially.  Very useful work is done with communities within groups and within sporting groups.  Most Members will agree it is beneficial work.  A good proportion of those who participate on the social employment scheme get into gainful employment, depending on the economy. In 1988-89 those people did very well but this year the uptake is slower.  A big number of those who participate in the teamwork scheme, which is not a big scheme, obtain employment.  The employment incentive and the enterprise schemes is not a big scheme directly assist people to get into employment by being employed directly by an employer who is paid a subsidy or being trained and then setting up their own small business.  I reject absolutely that the schemes are in any way a waste of time or a massage of the unemployment figures.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister may not have all the information available to him but can the Minister tell the House the number of people in Dublin who are on the social employment scheme?  Secondly, is the Minister concerned that the ESRI's recent report pointed out that in the long term neither training nor temporary employment schemes were found to have a significant impact on the probability of a person being in a job one year after finishing involvement in such schemes?  Has the Minister any comment to make on that? Will the Minister indicate what further <Col N="1518" /> research and follow-up will be done with regard to those who had been engaged in such schemes over the past 18 months to ascertain what their job position is one year after completing such schemes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked three questions.  First, I do not have the exact figure of those in Dublin who are on the social employment scheme.  In the Dublin Corporation area nobody is involved because they do not operate the scheme.  In the county council area a greater number are involved.  A large number of voluntary community bodies in Dublin use the scheme.  Regarding the ESRI report, the Department will look carefully at the suggestions they made.  I am of the view that we can continually change and improve the curriculum of some of the schemes.  I have done away with many of the schemes which were of no benefit.  We have grouped many of the schemes because of demands in other areas.  We want to be sure we get value for money, except in the social area.  We provide a great amount of training under the Youthreach Programme and for the travelling community.  I do not think the same criteria should be used in regard to them.  I can assure the Deputy that the ESRI recommendations will be closely examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the biggest tragedy is that at the end of the FÁS courses there is not usually employment for the people who go through the courses.  Will the Minister comment on the criticism of investment in education and training, published recently by the CII?  Is there a danger, notwithstanding the revamp of the FÁS courses, to which he has referred, that they are too much fund driven and that there is, perhaps, a necessity for us to look at both the suitability of investment in education and training for a modern industrial economy, of the type of education and who funds it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not heard either the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Taoiseach comment to the effect that they will be included in either the review of industrial <Col N="1519" /> policy or in the terms of reference of the task force under the Central Review Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the CII's recommendations.  Unfortunately, most of the suggestions made were in the education area and I cannot comment on them.  That is a matter for the Minister for Education.  We have always worked with the CII and have tried a number of their suggestions.  I am grateful for the co-operation of Liam Connellan on a number of schemes.  We took people from schemes and trained them to the criteria of industry on the basis that they would be placed in industries nominated by the CII.  This works very well in other countries where the private and the public sectors work together.  Individuals are trained and it is known where they are going at the end of the scheme.  Last year we designated 1,000 companies to take a named person.  The difficulty in the period 1982-90 &mdash; and this is referred to in the ESRI report &mdash; is in getting employers to take on unemployed people.  They will always take people who have higher educational ability, or higher standards and who have been in employment or want to move to a better job.  It is extremely difficult to get employers to take the people who are normally involved in the schemes.  One has to relate their policies to the labour market policies and that involves FÁS and the CII working together.</P>

      <P>In 1990, on DÍON's recommendations, grant assistance of £500,000 was paid by my Department to 29 organisations in Britain and to one agency in Dublin.  I am awaiting DÍON's recommendations for the grant aid allocation of £500,000 in my Department's Vote for this year.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Labour I have always encouraged employee participation and the development of the rights of workers to information and consultation regardless of whether the company is indigenous or multinational. Following the success of the PNR and the negotiation of its successor, the PESP, the benefits of the partnership and co-operative approach are apparent.  I believe that there is now a general recognition that co-operation and consensus, rather than conflict, is the best approach, not only at national level but also at the level of the enterprise.</P>
      <P>An FIE-ICTU joint declaration on employee involvement was published at the end of June.  This is a timely and significant development, and gives a very strong signal to employers, unions and workers that employee involvement is the key to good industrial relations.  I know that both FIE and ICTU are committed to the promotion of the contents and spirit of the document, and I hope it will encourage the development of involvement initiatives on a widespread basis in the private sector.</P>

The parameters of the Fourth EC Directive on Disclosure of Company Information exclude a great many Irish companies because of the criteria that must be met.

The Employer-Labour Conference will undertake the role of monitoring developments throughout the private sector.  The Irish Productivity Centre has been designated as a national participation agency to act as a supportive organisation for those who attempt to develop specific approaches at company level.  I believe &mdash; I have said it here many times &mdash; that companies lose by not sharing information because in the examples studied by the Galvin Commission a few years ago it was found that where people share information, not necessarily at board level, there are far fewer difficulties.</P>
      <P>There is an increasing view, both internationally and within our companies, that when a mechanism is provided whereby people are able to share information about what is happening in a company, about the profits and about the problems and are able to hear that information up front, then there are much fewer difficulties. That is a procedure that could be well followed here, and I hope that it is followed.  The document of FIE-ICTU sets out the models that should be followed and they recommend that role to their members.</P>

      <P>Some agencies are very good and the 3 per cent criterion is rigidly followed by their personnel departments, which are normally the bodies given the responsibility of implementation. However, as will be noted from the detailed reply I gave in May, many agencies and their personnel departments do not meet that criterion, for whatever reason.  I cannot claim credit for the number of disabled persons employed by the Department of Labour, because I think it was my predecessors in the Department who were responsible for that overall.  The Department of Labour employs a great number of disabled people and they work very well within the workforce.  I continue to encourage both my colleagues and semi-State organisations to follow the example provided by the Department of Labour.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any such incentives.  However, I know that the Department of Labour is always glad to employ disabled persons.  A few years ago a Deputy asked me to have the time obstacles for people in receipt of the employment incentive scheme removed. Once an employer takes on a disabled person and he or she is entered in the live register then the employer does not have to follow the other criteria.  I am not sure whether there is a national rehabilitation grant, but that benefit is of indirect assistance.</P>

      <P>As stated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government have agreed to have the position of agency workers and the legislation relating to the control of employment agencies examined.</P>
      <P>At present I am considering how best to fulfil that commitment in the context of the relevant proposals of the EC Commission concerning areas such as non-standard forms of employment.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress that in relation to agency workers the task of defining the precise employer-worker relationship has created difficulties.  The problem arises from the unusual nature of the contracts of some agency workers which make it impossible to identify whether it is the agency making the placement or the body for which the work is being done that is the actual employer.  My Department have had consultation with the Department of Social Welfare on this issue.</P>
      <P>In relation to employment agencies, which are governed by the Employment Agency Act, 1971, questions relating to the control and regulation of such agencies which have emerged in administering the legislation during the last 20 years are being examined.  Also the implications of the completion of the internal market must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I should point out that by and large the 200-odd licensed employment agencies in Ireland are well run and the number of complaints has been negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I consider that some attention should be given to revising criteria in relation to the granting of licences, particularly in relation to the vetting of <Col N="1529" /> applicants.  I am also examining the question of whether the scope of the Act should be extended to include categories of employment not previously covered, one example being au-pairs.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the reforms introduced by the Minister for part-time workers, but I ask him whether he would agree that, especially in a climate of high unemployment, some of the most serious exploitation takes place in relation to agency workers.  Many of those workers are either young people or women; by definition they are very vulnerable, tend not to be trade union organised and in some cases are subject to very serious exploitation.  At the end of the studies and investigations referred to by the Minister does he intend before the end of the year to bring forward legislation to deal with the problem, or how quickly could such legislation be introduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the House during the debate on legislation for part-time workers, the same section of the Department would start examination of this matter as soon as the previous legislation was dealt with.</P>
      <P>The position is similar to that pertaining when the Department started work on the legislation concerning part-time workers.  There was then and there is now very little data available at the outset.  It is very hard to know how many people are involved or what kind of difficulties exist.  However, I do accept what Deputy Rabbitte says: there are people who would be in a legal limbo in relation to their entitlements.  In some instances they would also experience great difficulties with their employers.  I am learn-ing hard from letters received from employers who are unhappy about loopholes being closed, as happened after legislation was passed for part-time workers.  As one goes on one finds out the things that have been happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and I have to try to establish just what is the best way to tackle the problems.  At this stage we are trying to compile numbers and use data <Col N="1530" /> available from the Department of Social Welfare.  I should prefer to wait until the autumn, when the section will be finished its investigations.  The section is now strengthened by the knowledge gained during work carried out on the part-time workers' legislation.  Some of the evidence used in that process can be carried over into this area.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned in my reply, a real problem is that the High Court did determine in a case, in which I as Minister for Labour was involved against a company, that an employee who had been with a company for two and a half years was not an employee of either the company or the agency.  It ruled that the employee, therefore, had no entitlement to holidays under the Holidays Act.  I certainly do not want to make any comment on the decision, but it does open a question of examination, which will have to be worked on.</P>

      <P>It is unlikely that a direct intervention by me would be helpful because of the nature of the problems involved.

      <P>I do not want to go into this at any great length because it has been controversial since 1984.  My predecessor also worked very hard trying to resolve this problem.  Last year after discussions here in the House we said that we should make a further effort and a great amount of effort was put in by the Congress of Trade Unions, by the monitoring committee, by the social employment scheme, by the Central <Col N="1532" /> Review Committee and the City Manager himself who directly led negotiations, along with his assistant managers and senior officials.  I acknowledge that we did make the commitment that there would be no further redundancies.

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that it is a national scandal that with over 80,000 unemployed people in Dublin, Dublin Corporation is blocked from employing a single person under the social employment scheme?  Would the Minister agree that no one union should take it upon itself to prevent people obtaining employment in our capital city under the social employment scheme? Would the Minister agree that it is no longer acceptable that this problem should be ignored in the light of the many reasonable attempts made by the Minister, his predecessor and Congress to resolve it and that the time has come for the management of Dublin Corporation to state that they will now employ persons under the social employment scheme and that the matter be so dealt with?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want there to be any rancour in regard to this.  I would like to resolve it if I thought it was resolvable. The position paper we made available to the unions at the time stated that the Government wanted the resources to be made available for the SES to go to the most disadvantaged area, that by any objective standards the Dublin Corporation area was the most disadvantaged area, that the information I had at that stage last year was that eight wards had unemployment rates of over 50 per cent and that the comparative figures for Dublin County Council, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, were three, one, one and zero wards respectively and that it was preferable that local authorities rather than voluntary bodies would oversee the projects.  That was my <Col N="1533" /> wish because, as Deputy Doyle said, we could get a greater number of people involved.  I cannot answer the question Deputy Doyle asked but I would say that under the SES scheme in Dublin County Council there were 250 participants, small numbers compared with some of the rural county councils which, over the years, managed to employ 500 people under the scheme.  Therefore the potential for Dublin could be of the order of a few thousand people if we could solve the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the numbers unemployed in Dublin which is in excess of 80,000 and the numbers on the social employment scheme, would the Minister agree that the two Dublin local authorities should currently have in the region of 3,500 people employed under the scheme?  Could the Minister confirm that there is an absolute blockage on the use of it by Dublin Corporation and a semi-blockage on the use of it by Dublin County Council?  Would the Minister agree that the trade union movement is damaged by IMPACT preventing the use of the scheme in Dublin? In so far as the trade union movement protests about increasing levels of unemployment it is contributing to those levels by disallowing the use of the scheme in Dublin.  Finally, in the consultations that the Government are now to engage in under the Central Review Committee with the ICTU, will they bring to that committee the concerns of the Government and of this House about the prevention of the use of the social employment scheme in Dublin and insist that the blockage in that regard be lifted and, in the context of doing that, authorise the Dublin City and County management to seek to create additional new jobs in Dublin under the SES scheme?</P>

      <P>There are a number of questions there.  I want to be clear on one aspect, that is, to acknowledge that the Congress of Trade Unions themselves were very helpful in the negotiations. Congress in their co-ordinating role did as much as I could ask them to do last <Col N="1534" /> year in this matter.  I will bring the other matters raised to the attention of the Department of the Environment who were involved in the discussions last year because any instructions to senior county managers would be a matter for them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that if this problem is to be resolved it is only capable of being resolved by negotiation and agreement between the parties concerned?  Will he acknowledge that one of the difficulties the trade unions concerned have is their fear &mdash; without comment on whether it continues to be justified &mdash; that people will begin to be employed under the SES for work that was traditionally done by full-time employees of Dublin Corporation and that their fears in that respect have to be assuaged if the scheme is to be successful in the two Dublin local authorities?</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that that was the difficulty and it was with that in mind that we undertook last year not just to get involved through the monitoring committee but to involve the Congress of Trade Unions, the Department of the Environment, the most senior officials in the Department of Labour and the City Manager himself so that no party would be left out and that the assurances we were given would have the stamp of approval of everybody concerned. Because of my wish to have the matter negotiated I do not want to get into conflict here.  I must have answered a similar question in the House 20 times as did my predecessors.  The difficulty is that other local authorities have successfully done millions of pounds worth of very useful community and environmental work, to the disadvantage of Dublin, in being unable to reach the quota.  I am nationally responsible, but I want to say there is a clear loss of beneficial work to the systems of this city because of the difficulties, whatever the reasons for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House adjourned I was endeavouring to demonstrate what size farm enterprise could bring in the equivalent of an average industrial wage.  In 1989, 23 dairy cows would have provided an average industrial wage and in 1991, 57 dairy cows would provide an industrial wage.  In relation to single suckling, which is an alternative farm livestock enterprise, in 1989, 82 acres would have provided the equivalent of an industrial wage and in 1991 one would need 106 acres.  I could go on providing comparative figures from information provided by the IFA and other farms organisations.  The point is that, even before any discussions in relation to the reform of GATT or the CAP, a serious income problem has arisen here in agriculture generally.  Is it any wonder that there is grave concern with regard to the future of agriculture? The concern is further heightened by the fact that a solution, which must be found, can no longer be found entirely by <Col N="1622" /> national governments.  Our membership of the enlarged Community of necessity means that European decisions on food production and marketing will have repercussions on our industry.  It is the duty of Government, particularly the Minister for Agriculture, to ensure that our agricultural interests are protected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that our partners in the EC fully understand our overall dependence on agriculture.</P>
      <P>Irish farmers and farming organisations compaigned for membership of the European Community because of the scope membership provided to expand production and because of the benefits to be derived from access to financially remunerative markets.  We joined the EC, too, because of the principle enshrined in the Treaty of Rome of support for weaker economies and special treatment for countries such as Ireland which have regional imbalances.  Irish farmers were encouraged to respond to incentives to increase production.  They borrowed and invested heavily in modernising the industry to meet the competitive challenges of the market and they responded particularly to the requirement to produce food products to the strictest quality requirements.  The tragedy is that for many farmers the repayment capacity of the enterprise for which they borrowed was related to the level of production and the profit pertaining at that time.  Now, through no fault on the part of individual farmers, their capacity to produce has been curtailed and the profitability of the enterprise has been considerably reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that this is the pattern throughout Europe and that there is a surplus of agricultural production in most European countries.  I also know that the problem in most European countries will not have the same devastating effect on their economics as it will have in Ireland. There is not any other country in Europe with the same overall dependence on the <Col N="1623" /> agricultural sector and there is not any country less able to cope with the economic consequences of these proposals. The considerable investment by the EC in helping to develop Irish agriculture, backed by farmer investment, will be brought to nil if the proposed package of GATT and CAP reform is proceeded with.</P>
    <P>I would acknowledge the quick and decisive response of the Taoiseach and the Minister in opposing these proposals. They have demonstrated their understanding of the problem facing individuals and of the consequences for our economy.  However, the Taoiseach and the Government should not underestimate the level of panic and concern in the community as individual farmers look on helplessly as the industry goes into decline.  There is concern about their ability to earn a living, about their inability to meet commitments to banks and traders, about interest accumulating on unserviced debts and about the undermining of their natural talents in husbandry and good farming practices.  In many cases they are concerned that they do not have the opportunity and the training in order to adapt to alternative employment and to a different lifestyle.</P>
    <P>It is not in my nature to be a pessimist, but we cannot bury our heads in the sand. The outcome of our efforts will decide the lives of thousands of farmers and their families and it will also shape the structure of communities in rural towns and villages.  We talk with some justification about the closure of post offices and Garda stations, but there will not be any need for these services if the power base of our economy &mdash; the land &mdash; is denuded of its lifeblood.  When we talk about implementing the policy of &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; we are giving birth to a bureaucratic solution to overproduction which lacks the will, not to mention the ability, to cope with problems like world hunger and to put in place a marketing programme which takes these important considerations into account.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Commissioner MacSharry on his recent announced <Col N="1624" /> desire to create a world food bank for the fast redistribution of food without the cost of intervention and other storage costs.  This Government and other European governments should support this proposal.  We do not have any desire to use our surplus European production to suppress the developing agricultural economies of the Third World.  We must face reality and recognise that millions of men, women and children go to bed hungry every night while we are finding it impossible to market surplus production, not to mention the cost of providing storage for surplus food production.  Would it not be better for the world powers to address this problem for the benefit of all mankind?  I would impress on the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government the urgency of taking a positive and decisive stand on this issue.  If this goes on, we will not be talking just about farmers and farm income but the livelihoods of other workers and their families.  For Ireland, the benefits of EC membership will be seriously eroded if the principles of the CAP are dismantled.  The Treaty of Rome makes special provision for countries, where a vital national interest is at stake.  It is on this basis that we must take positive action.</P>
    <P>While I would prefer to see agriculture being developed by means of good farming practices and modern farming techniques and to see income related to production, I believe restricted production and declining prices will deprive many small farmers of an adequate income. Before proceeding with a policy of direct income support we must explore every alternative in the context of income related to production and marketing and demand Community preference for Community producers, particularly for Ireland and Irish farmers, who have a special dependence on agriculture.</P>
    <P>I would add a word of caution in relation to established commercial farmers. These farmers responded to the call to modernise the agricultural industry. They have made a substantial contribution towards increasing the level of agricultural exports and modern food <Col N="1625" /> production.  We need to be careful that we do not undermine the viability of these farmers and their enterprise because to do so would be to undermine our entire economy.</P>
    <P>The proposed GATT and CAP reforms, particularly as they relate to Ireland, raise questions about the disadvantaged status of our country <i>vis-á-vis</i> our European neighbours.  Our isolation from mainland Europe places us at a disadvantage in terms of costs related to marketing, thus limiting our capacity to export competitively.  With such a high proportion of this country now included in the disadvantaged areas scheme, a case should be made for full designation with agreed modulation as between poor farming regions and those less severely disadvantaged.  I wish to make a special plea to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the appeals board to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that every townland in Ireland which meets with the criteria is included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all of us agree that the primary purpose of the proposed CAP reforms is to reduce the ever-growing mountains of surplus food in the Community. I should like first to refer to a sector of agriculture which would not contribute to mountains of any kind.  I am referring to organic farming, which seems to have received scant attention in the past from the farming organisations and the media in general.  One Commission document which dealt broadly with the reform proposals referred more than once to the desirability of promoting farming which would be friendly to the environment.  While the word &ldquo;organic&rdquo; was not mentioned in that document, I assume that this is what was meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has taken a keen personal interest in this matter, so much so that today he launched a new symbol of certification and operation by the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers' Association. I understand it was on his initiative that a special organic farming unit was set up last year by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  This unit, who are <Col N="1626" /> known as OFU, have not been idle or, to coin a phrase, let the grass grow under their feet.  During the past year they have concentrated on establishing an effective research and training education base for the industry.  Their work is proceeding apace and I am confident that the Minister will ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to this very important area.</P>
    <P>This unit has already provided sufficient funds for such projects as the organic farming course in UCD, a major research and development programme undertaken by Teagasc at Johnstown Castle, a demonstration unit at Kildangan College, an organic development centre in the Shannon region and a video production on the various concepts involved in location, market and price structure.  In addition, funds have been provided for a market survey by CBF into the potential markets and prices for organic meat at home and abroad.  I was happy to learn recently that the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers' Association have reported a sufficient demand for information from many farmers who are interested in changing over to organic farming.  I should like to see farming organisations encouraging many more of their members to take an interest in this type of farming.</P>
    <P>The EC has implemented a regulation governing production, processing and labelling of organic produce.  This very important and welcome step is designed to harmonise procedures and standards throughout the Community.  It is expected that all member states will implement their programmes within the next 12 months.  This would include the setting up of a revision and inspection system.  I am convinced that the wider development of organic farming would provide a worthwhile livelihood for our farmers as it is much more labour-intensive than conventional farming and it would be a long time before supply outstripped demand.  Indeed, such is the demand for clean and healthy food that prices should be at a premium.  Furthermore, organic farming has the advantage that it protects the environment and wildlife.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that organic farming will <Col N="1627" /> need to be propped up by special price supports.  However, I believe a strong case can be made for initial financial assistance.  The regulations set out a production system which must be followed for at least three years before produce can be certified and sold as organic.  It is not advisable for farmers to turn over their entire holdings <i>en bloc</i> to the new system.  This way farmers will be able to maintain the greater part of their incomes from present sources while simultaneously proceeding with the new development.  The changeover to organic farming could present a greater difficulty for small farmers.  Perhaps the Minister will look at the possibility of urging the setting up of an internal EC mechanism to help farmers during what could be described as this limbo period when they are changing over to organic farming.</P>
    <P>We have an ideal environment from which to lead Europe in this area.  I know the Minister is committed to the promotion of Ireland as the greenest and most fertile land in the Community and the one most capable of producing the cleanest and healthiest foods.  Our farmers have demonstrated over the years that they have the skill and determination to adapt to any situation.  We have now reached the time for such an approach if we want to ensure the future prosperity of our agricultural industry and not continue to have to depend entirely on producing commodities over and above market requirements.  Organic farming is one solution to overproduction.  We must not let this opportunity pass us by.</P>

      <P>The first point I want to stress is that these proposals will wipe out in one swoop half of the entire benefits Ireland is supposed to get from the Structural Funds over the five year period following the Single European Act.  The ESRI have stated:</P>
      <P>The adverse effects of CAP reform will do much to offset the beneficial impact of the Community support framework on the level of GNP.  The cost of the CAP reform could offset up to half the benefits expected to arise from the Community support framework by the end of the decade.</P>
      <P>I wonder if people outside agriculture realise that half of the entire benefits we are supposed to get under the Internal Market, Regional Funds and Social Funds over the next five years is going to be wiped out by this proposal.  I wonder if people outside agriculture realise that up to 16,000 PAYE jobs will be wiped out as a result of these proposals and that in many cases these are not jobs in provincial towns but in the very centre of our cities, jobs which will be lost as a result of reduced consumer spending by farmers, reduced spending on building by the farming community and reduced spending by food processors and people supplying farm machinery.  These jobs will be lost across the entire territory of Ireland.  There should be no division in this House or in the nation on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed at some of the comments made at the conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions where they seemed to almost argue in favour of the changes.  I know that is not the attitude of any party in this House.  I am glad to be able to say that that is the case, but I hope one result of this discussion will be that the Irish farming organisations will get together with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federation of Irish <Col N="1629" /> Employers and the Confederation of Irish Industry and use their influence in Europe to stop these proposals in the national interest.  We in the Fine Gael Party are part of the European Christian Democratic group.  I shall be meeting members of the group &mdash; I have already met at least six European Prime Minisers who are also Christian Democrats &mdash; to put the case on behalf of Ireland.  It is also very important that this case is made in the economic and social committee of the European Community by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, by the Confederation of Irish Industry, as well as by representatives of farming, because everybody's income and livelihood is at stake in this debate.  Let me repeat again that half of the benefits to be gained from the European Community during the next five years by way of the Structural Funds will be wiped out if these proposals are accepted.</P>
    <P>That being the case, my reaction to the Taoiseach's response when presented with a copy of the draft communiqué which runs to 32 pages at the Luxembourg Summit, is amazement.  The communiqué states: &ldquo;The European Council considers the Uruguay Round to be the first priority in international economic relations and stresses the importance of concluding these negotiations before the end of the year&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach agreed with that statement.  He also agreed with the following sentence: &ldquo;The European Council calls on the Council and the Commission, in its capacity as negotiator, to continue their efforts to enable the Uruguay Round to come to a satisfactory conclusion&rdquo;. However, he did not seek to have included in that communiqué, as he should and could have done, specific words such as &ldquo;but bears in mind the need to ensure that those countries within the European Community which are dependent on agriculture will have their incomes adequately protected&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would have been very easy for the Taoiseach to have such language included in the communiqué, but he failed to take the opportunity to do so.  He did not seek to have the proposals put on the agenda; <Col N="1630" /> and when they were included in the communiqué with which he agreed he failed to take the opportunity to have any reference to the fact that Ireland is dependent on agriculture included.  I can only describe the Taoiseach's failure to do so in Luxembourg as crass negligence.  He failed to do his duty as the leader of the Irish people.  It is clear that the talks on the Common Agricultural Policy will be concluded before the next summit, which is due to be held at Maastricht.  Therefore, the last chance the Taoiseach had to have something agreed to by the prime ministers of Europe to protect Irish agriculture was at the summit in Luxembourg, but he failed to have such language included in the communiqué.</P>
    <P>We should compare this with the approach adopted by former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald in 1984, when he visited every European Community capital to speak personally with the prime ministers of those countries with regard to the threat posed by the milk superlevy. Having walked out one of the summit meetings, he succeeded in getting an exceptionally good deal for Ireland by using his own offices.  Yet, the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, who is not present in the House for this debate, who has not participated in it so far and, as far as I can see, has no intention of doing so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;did not succeed in having half a sentence included in a 32 page document to highlight the needs of agriculture.  He had a golden opportunity in Luxembourg to have such a phrase included on page 13 or 14 of the document but he failed to take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from the speech of the Minister that the Government have no plan or vision for the future of Irish agriculture. The Minister for Agriculture and Food and his Department see their role as one of reacting to proposals put forard by others.  No proposals have been made by Ireland as to how the problem of surplus stocks should be dealt with.  Therefore, we are simply reacting to what <Col N="1631" /> others have to say.  Clearly, someone who finds himself in that position is not the master of his own destiny.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points which were made by Deputy Deasy in this debate that I wish to underline.  First, the proposals with regard to cereals will undermine Ireland's natural comparative advantage in the area of grass based production. They will reduce a natural and inherent advantage which we have in terms of competitive agriculture.  I also wish to stress the point made by Deputy Deasy that under these proposals we will increasingly see the richer countries such as Germany, France, Italy and Britain, who have a large exchequer and very few farmers, being able to top up set-aside, headage and environmental grants to give extra to their farmers.  They will be able to bring them within the welfare net and to give them substantial incomes under the guise of their national welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what we will have is two speed agriculture, with large amounts of money being given from the national coffers in the rich countries to prop up inherently uncompetitive agricultural production, with the natural comparative advantage enjoyed by agriculture in countries such as Ireland being destroyed because the Government, due to financial constraints, will not be able to compete with the Germans.  The Taoiseach should have insisted that there be no national aids to agriculture &mdash; we either have a Common Agriculture Policy or we do not.  There should be no capacity to top up or to give national aids.  If national aids are introduced, Ireland will not be able to complete.  We have failed to take a stand on principle on that matter and we should have done so.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the price talks agreement on agriculture breached the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Government state, in paragraph 7, section 6, of that document that they will seek to ensure that major Irish interests are protected, including in particular the safeguarding of full quotas for milk.  As we are aware, in the recent <Col N="1632" /> price talks the quotas were reduced.  The Government have accepted this.  The Taoiseach has made many highly defensive interventions with regard to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> during the past few days, but he failed to refer to the fact that the condition had been breached by the agreement in the price talks.  Why?  The answer is that he clearly does not regard it as important.  That part of the programme, because it refers to agriculture, has no significance in the Taoiseach's mind and he did not even refer to it; but let me put it on the record of the House that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has been broken in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point that I wish to make as, obviously, I cannot spend too much time on this matter because I do not want to take up the time of other Deputies who also wish to speak. These proposals will ultimately destroy the competitiveness of European agriculture. They will introduce an artificial situation in agriculture where farmers will be forced to go slow.  We will amost have the agricultural equivalent of a work to rule.  If there is a factory in one part of town working to rule, with nobody working any faster than two miles an hour, and another factory in another part of town where everybody can work as fast as they can, who will win out?  The MacSharry proposals will suppress the natural tendency of anybody in any economic enterprise to produce more.  That is going to be destroyed so far as agriculture is concerned, particularly in the disadvantaged areas, because before people will be able to qualify for compensation they will have to have no more than half a cow per acre.  People outside the disadvantaged areas will be allowed up to one cow per acre.  I believe that this change with regard to restricting compensation within the disadvantaged areas will lead to many people who wanted to have their lands included in the disadvantaged areas wanting to get out of it again because of the provision that has been buried deep in the proposals made by the Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry. Why?  Because he does not want to spend <Col N="1633" /> money in the disadvantaged areas.  Therefore, having given with one hand, he now proposes to take away with the other.  He wants to leave Irish farmers in a position where they will quite literally be unable to plan for the future and operate as business people who want to maximise their output and do as good a job as possible in their area.  The effect of these proposals will ultimately be to turn European agriculture into a form of Indian reservation, where people will be paid to do nothing or as little as possible. I do not know, Sir, if you have ever had the opportunity to visit an Indian reservation, but I have had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a most demoralising experience to see people whose spirit has been quite literally destroyed. I visited one such town in an Indian reservation.  The streets were deserted in the middle of a working day, but the bar was full.  People had so little self-respect that it was plain to one's senses that most of them had not washed for at least a month.  They were all beyond drunkeness, in a state of stupor.  They had no incentive to do anything.  If they left the reservation they would lose their income. As long as they stayed on the reservation they had to do as little as possible in order to qualify for assistance.  We see in the seeds of the MacSharry propsals the prospects ten or 15 years ahead of turning rural Europe, and rural Ireland in particular, into a form of Indian reservation which will demoralise our people and destroy not just the economic values but the spiritual and social values of our people as well.  That is what is at stake in this debate and I hope people realise how serious it is.  It is not just an economic issue; it is a social, spiritual and national issue also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the Government must put forward alternative proposals based on the concept that in Europe we should be able to feed ourselves.  If we construct <Col N="1634" /> through the MacSharry proposals a structure of agriculture which is inherently inefficient and encouraged to be so by the assistance it is given, ten to 15 years from now Europe will not be able to feed itself and will have to import food as it had to do in the forties and fifties.  Then we will need a huge reinvestment in agriculture and we will lament what we destroyed. That is the way we are heading.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach has the capacity, which he clearly did not have in Luxembourg, to convey a certain sense of that dreadful vision to his 11 colleagues. Unless we can convey some sense of what these proposals will ultimately do in terms of destroying rural Europe's morale, we will never achieve any coherent defence against these proposals.  It is not enough simply to object to everything. We must show that there is an alternative way forward.  I hope that out of this debate such a way forward will emanate.</P>

      <P>I welcome this short debate in view of the present crisis in agriculture. It seems the crisis has not yet registered with the Coalition Government and, in particular, with the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>In the year 1989 net incomes in agriculture fell by 14 per cent and this was before the MacSharry proposals.  These proposals could be described as a redundancy package for farmers.  The package is designed to eliminate about 30,000 farmers over a very short period of time and will decimate entire rural populations.</P>
      <P>Let us first look at the present proposals regarding milk.  The national milk herd is very important in that it provides not alone milk and its products but also the main resource for our beef industry.  These proposals would further reduce milk prices by 8p per gallon on top of a 16p per gallon cut in 1990.  After taking compensation into consideration, this will still represent a reduction of 11 per cent in the net profits to our milk farmers.</P>

    <P>In 1984 certain proposals were made regarding the dairy industry and the then <Col N="1635" /> Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, achieved a derogation from them for the farmers of Ireland.  In view of this precedent, I am calling on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to ensure that a similar derogation is achieved for Ireland on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The proposals regarding the beef industry are the most frightening.  A 15 per cent cut in beef prices at a time when the profit margin is already extremely low is surely the final blow to the beef farmers.</P>
    <P>Where a high level of borrowing is required a loss is now inevitable.  At present our beef industry is worth £1 billion to the economy and the case made about the cost of intervention is accepted. However, while the EC are paying for this intervention, at the same time beef imports to the Community are in the region 800,000 tons, practically the same amount of meat that is being placed in intervention.  The Community is in fact self-sufficient where beef is concerned and the problem is the importation of beef from countries outside the Community. Mr. MacSharry should, instead of bankrupting the farmers of this country, attack this problem from the angle of imported beef in the EC.</P>
    <P>The proposals regarding cereals are devastating.  They represent the last straw for about 50 per cent of our cereal growers. As our economy depends so much on grass for our sheep, dairy and beef production, Mr. MacSharry's cheaper cereal policy will undermine these producers. Irish livestock producers use only half the cereal-based compounds used in other European countries.  This will undermine our competitiveness and will cost the economy millions of pounds in lost revenue over the next few years.</P>
    <P>There is a high labour content in the processing of cereals and any interference will create huge unemployment. I call on the Minister to stop all importation of cheap fillers and grain from eastern Europe and other countries outside the EC.</P>
    <P>A mandate was given by the Council of Ministers to Mr. MacSharry regarding <Col N="1636" /> GATT negotiations to seek protection rebalancing on cereal substitutes and maintain the dual price system.  A casual review of Mr. MacSharry's latest proposals clearly shows that he has abandoned the EC position on rebalancing and the dual price system.</P>
    <P>There is absolute discrimination in the proposed compensation system against the average cereal grower.  If Tony O'Reilly grows 92 tonnes of oats for his horses he will be fully compensated but an average grower producing over 230 tonnes would receive little or no compensation.</P>
    <P>The proposals with regard to the sheep producers are disastrous for this sector, already very badly hit with huge income reductions over the past two years.  The present level of ewe premiums must be maintained to protect existing sheep producers' incomes.</P>
    <P>We find in the MacSharry plan a proposal to pay premia on only 350 ewes per flock outside the disadvantaged areas.  This proposal is completely at variance with the advice given by farmers over the past number of years.  This will restrict the sheep industry as a large number of farmers in the non-classified areas have flocks with numbers far in excess of 350 ewes. If these ewes do not qualify for the premium they will become uneconomic units.  This will result in radical de-stocking. This proposal should certainly be deleted from the overall package.</P>
    <P>We are at this stage not self-sufficient with regard to sheep meat in Europe. The Minister must take blame for the present problems due to his failure to push the EC Commission to restrict imports from New Zealand during the months from April to August.  During these months there are ample lambs being produced in the EC and at the same time 200,000 tonnes of lamb are being imported into the EC from New Zealand. These imports are creating a surplus on the market and the consumer does not benefit in any way.  I made these points last year to the Minister and he treated that debate with absolute contempt.  A five-year-old child could have written the reply by the Minister of State.  It was a <Col N="1637" /> scandal.  Had we restricted imports of New Zealand lamb, particularly into England, we would not have the surplus we have today and we would have a completely different price structure.</P>
    <P>According to EuroStat figures, the average income of EC farmers showed an increase of 5 per cent in 1990 but the income of Irish farmers was reduced by 11.5 per cent during the same period.  We must let it be known that we are prepared to protect our vital national interest at all costs and press our viewpoint with sincerity and vigour.  The importance of agriculture to our economy is the essence of our argument.  If we lose that argument we face not just an economic crisis but social upheaval and possible unrest brought about by a vast increase in unemployment and lower living standards.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the speeches of the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, and I heard nothing about proposals to relieve the problem.  The attitude of the Minister in this House over the past six months has been objectionable in every respect.  I tabled 120 questions regarding the disadvantaged areas but he refused to give answers.  I know the documentation is in his office. His attitude to our spokesman, Deputy Deasy, is also objectionable.  He refuses to answer questions and gives the impression that he is doing this, that and the other.  In 1985 there was no problem about farm incomes.  The farmers were happy.  From large areas of the country there were no proposals regarding disadvantaged area status.  A different situation prevails today.  Incomes are being decimated and people are so worried about the effects of this on themselves and their families that they are looking for disadvantaged area designation in the hope that the grants will help them out of their difficulties.</P>

      <P>It is important to emphasise <Col N="1638" /> that we are still dealing only with proposals which the EC Commission want to phase in on a three year basis starting in 1993.  Therefore, we have a year and a half to negotiate changes in these proposals and to ensure that CAP reform does not result in CAP destruction.  I have every confidence in the ability of our negotiators to protect their vital national interests in the upcoming talks on CAP reform, which the Taoiseach has said are only beginning and will be long drawn out and arduous.  Let us be in no doubt that the vital national interests are at stake in these discussions.</P>
      <P>When agriculture's contribution to the overall economy in Ireland is compared with the total EC situation, it is over three times more important as regards output, exports and employment.  The contribution of beef production is nine times more important in Ireland's economy than overall in the EC, while milk production in Ireland is seven times more important than in the EC as a whole. Bearing in mind that <i>per capita</i> income levels in the Irish economy are less than 70 per cent of the EC average, it is undeniable that a vital national interest is at stake in CAP reform.  While most of the discussions so far have concentrated on the proposed price cuts and quota cuts in the CAP reform document, there is a danger that the effects of one of the most fundamental changes of all could be over-looked, that is the relativity between the value of grass and cereals.  Grass is to Ireland what North Sea oil is to Britain, what electronics is to Germany and Japan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The kernel of the EC Commissioner's proposal's to reform the CAP is a 35 per cent reduction in cereal prices to be phased in over three years.  I contend that a reduction in cereal prices of this magnitude will devalue the price of <Col N="1639" /> grass by the same amount and make our grass based exports &mdash; beef, sheep and dairy products &mdash; less competitive on export markets without even taking into consideration the other proposed price and quota cuts.  The Commission is proposing that cereal producers will be more or less compensated for this cut in income, depending on their tillage acreage. However, if producers of one sort of animal feed are deemed eligible for compensation, surely grass producers should be eligible on the same basis.</P>
      <P>Cheaper grain will reduce the demand for grass on which Ireland's rural economy is based and a cheap cereals policy would hit us very hard because grassland accounts for 82 per cent of our land area as opposed to 47 per cent of the total EC figure.  The impact of such a policy would be felt first and foremost on pigmeat and poultry meat prices, where the price of concentrate feed accounts for almost 70 per cent of total production costs.  It is true that the price of pigmeat and poultry meat would come down, but this would be at the expense of all products produced from grass, which accounts for the vast bulk of our agricultural exports. Because a cheap cereals policy would devalue grassland as a source of livestock feed, it would also inevitably encourage further intensification of livestock production in the Community as feeders switch over to the cheaper grain.  Clearly, such a development would be in conflict with the stated environmental policy objectives of the Commission.  I cannot stress strongly enough that a cheap cereals policy will cause immense damage to Irish agriculture and EC agriculture. It will undermine the price support system for livestock products and encourage intensification based on feed lot production. In addition, it is likely that Ireland could become an importer of cereals, adding an importation charge which would put Irish livestock production at a further competitive disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept fully that the CAP needs reform and that we can keep on putting butter into storage ships around our <Col N="1640" /> coasts or piling beef into intervention, but we need to reform the CAP in a sensible way by re-establishing the principle of Community preference, which has more or less gone out the window over the past few years.  For example, preferential and illegal imports of calves, cattle and beef are causing a major imbalance in the EC market and they are increasing the cost of the beef regime. The amount of grain in intervention is almost directly equivalent to the amount of cereal substitutes imported into the Community each year.  While the EC has been cutting back on milk production over the past eight years, other countries have been increasing their production to the extent that the world market is still out of balance despite the sacrifices of Irish and European farmers.</P>
    <P>It is not generally realised that the EC milk quota is something like 10.2 million tonnes less than 1983 production, yet over the same period American production increased by 6 per cent and Japanese production by 15 per cent.  Over 70 per cent of the reduction in milk supply from the EC has been filled by the increase in these countries alone.</P>
    <P>In any reform of the CAP the EC should seek reciprocal supply reductions in other major producing countries in keeping with the Commission's own declaration in 1987.  This would reduce the cost of the CAP and satisfy the GATT objectives on support reductions.  A supply management approach to the problem would alleviate the budgetary difficulties now facing the CAP, as commercial supplies would decline worldwide and prices would stabilise.  Such a policy would also encourage farmers to produce quality food products and reduce the intensity of production, thereby meeting the Commission's environmental objectives.</P>
    <P>In any reform of the CAP we must be careful to ensure that our commercial family farmers are not put at risk.  If we undermine our commercial farmers we also undermine our food industry and retard its capacity to compete internationally. The creation of a social agriculture in the EC as opposed to a <Col N="1641" /> commercially viable agriculture would be no more than a one generation solution. While a social agriculture may stabilise a rural population in the short term, it would create or perpetuate an unviable farm structure and this could lead to the devastation of the rural economy in the next generation.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to one glaring omission from the Commissioner's compensatory measures as proposed in the CAP reform document.  Heifers are to be excluded from the annual compensatory headage payments for beef.  Since half the national beef output by number and about one-third by value are female, this is a major exclusion which I have no doubt our negotiators will take up with the authority in Brussels in their attempt to improve this most unsatisfactory set of proposals.</P>
    <P>To sum up, we all accept the need for sensible CAP reforms but reforms which will be less damaging to farm incomes than the present proposals.  The objectives of reform should be to guarantee the long-term viability and prosperity of family farms and rural areas, to improve the competitiveness of EC agriculture and to provide direct income aids for farmers in less favoured regions and for those facing permanent income difficulties.</P>
    <P>I cannot let the opportunity go without making reference to the disadvantaged areas.  While I acknowledge the tremendous effort made in surveying large parts of the country, we must also acknowledge the fact that there is still a large number of townlands throughout the country which meet EC criteria for designation and which have not been designated.  I call on the Minister and the appeals board to right this wrong.</P>

      <P>I am glad he has not got Deputy Dukes's faith.  I am concerned about this proposal, which is a clever one. People who are hard pressed for cash at the moment believe there is potential for cash from the EC.  This is a highly organised, clever campaign.  Considering the tradition of the Commission, there is no guarantee that money will continue to be provided for any period of time. However, it is not the money that concerns me or what farmers are going to get in cash, although it would be beneficial to some for a short period, it is what this proposal will do psychologically both to farmers and to Ireland itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1643" /> Let us consider the concept of leaving land lie fallow.  Figures have been thrown about to the effect that over £60 an acre is being paid to leave land lie fallow.  The land would have to be sprayed during that period, otherwise it would end up in an obnoxious state.  However, it would cost a lot less than £67 to spray it.  The real culprits in all of this &mdash; it has been happening since last August &mdash; are the Americans, who insisted on bullying their way through the GATT talks.  This matter is tied intricately to the GATT agreements.  It concerns me that 800,000 farmers in America can dictate terms to ten million European farmers.  America has become more and more isolationist in the last number of years in regard to foreign policy.  Only 9 per cent of Americans hold passports, which show their deep and intricate knowledge of the rest of the world.  What concerns me is that 800,000 Americans can dictate the pace to ten million Europeans.  Europe is becoming a strength within the world and let us not bow to others who have military powers.</P>
    <P>In the last ten days a guarantee has been given to American farmers that they will receive £1 per gallon of milk for the next five years under a £25 million programme.  That has not been guaranteed to Irish farmers.  They will receive a further reduction, bringing the price to as low as 70p a gallon in some areas.  For people who have bought quotas to try to make a living and improve their farms, this is a disaster.  There is nothing in this proposal that is beneficial to the Irish farmers, but, unfortunately, some have been fooled into thinking they will receive cash and can continue with the same lifestyle.</P>
    <P>Overall, what does this mean for our expanding food industry?  It means the supplies will not be available.  Companies, some of whom have amalgamated, will be short of supplies and will be unable to continue in operation. Amalgamations of co-operatives have caused problems in many areas.  In the future there will not be a sufficient number of farmers to supply milk to these <Col N="1644" /> co-operatives.  What is being done in regard to importations of soya, gluten feed and all the products coming from different parts of the world?  Let us take manioc for example, which is supposed to be beneficial to the Thai people and therefore to the Third World.  Its production is controlled by four Dutch and two German firms and is managed by Chinese.  Therefore, the Thai people are getting nothing out of it.  The Dutch and Germans are producing an extra couple of thousand gallons of milk every year. That has to be related to the benefit of grass culture.  That is the one area we depend on.</P>
    <P>One matter that concerns me is the fact that we are going to destroy rural Ireland. People who worked on the land for a living will now adopt a dole mentality &mdash; the less they do the more they get paid in cash terms.  What sort of society will that result in?  We already know from the long-term unemployed what happens in those circumstances.  I dread to think of what will happen.  Our whole way of life in rural Ireland will be destroyed.  We often suggest to a person with a financial problem to sell a site.  This encourages people in urban areas to move to country areas to buy cheap sites.  Urban standcards are then applied to rural areas and no development takes place in many of those areas.  A whole culture is destroyed in that way.</P>
    <P>Our whole approach to this matter must be to oppose it.  While we recognise that there must be reform, there is a clear need for support within the Community for family farms.  It was amusing to hear the British Minister, Mr. Gummer, this morning opposing this proposal on the basis of family farms.  We know there is a big difference between family farms in England and family farms here.  If we do not oppose this matter strenuously the preservation of our rural society and a clean farming environment &mdash; the reason we joined the EC &mdash; will be wiped out. That would be to the detriment not just of the rural communities and farmers but of the whole economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not speak about <Col N="1645" /> why our time is limited on this debate. Percentage cuts can be deceptive.  A percentage cut to the large man would have a major impact and to the small man would have a minimal impact.  However, due to the buoyancy of the larger man, he would be better able to take the percentage cut.  The same applies with percentage increases.  I never favoured percentage increases.  If a person had an income of £60,000 and the increase was 30 per cent, he would get 30 per cent of £60,000 whereas the person on an income of £1,000 would receive only 30 per cent of £1,000.  Therefore, percentages are deceptive in that way.</P>
      <P>Leaked documents seem to be the order to today.  I totally abhor all leaked documents.  Documents can be leaked for two reasons &mdash; first, to test the ground to find out the feeling of the people and, second, through inefficiency of the system, the latter being the most serious case.  If a document is leaked through inefficiency in the European system, some corrective measure should be taken.  People have been surmising about a leaked document on the GATT proposals. Previously we spent weeks here discussing leaked documents.  The same applies on this occasion, and that is serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not right for anybody on any side of this House or in any farming organisation to take the high ground on this issue.  It is an issue which concerns each and every one of us.  The farmers who represent this side of the House are as good as the farmers who represent any other side, and the farmers representing the party to which I belong are as good as those who represent any other party. We will not preside over a situation where the whole system will fall around us and we do not know what is happening.  Of course that is not the case, because we are all well informed as to what is happening. If Commissioner MacSharry or anybody else puts proposals to Europe that do not suit our requirements we will not agree with them.  Had we a Belgian or a Frenchman as Commissioner what would be the outcome for this country? Ray MacSharry is Commissioner.  He is <Col N="1646" /> a former Minister for Finance and knows the whole structure of finances in this area.  He was also Minister for Agriculture. With that background he is looking after our affairs in Brussels.  If he does not look after our affairs to the best of his ability, in my view he is a poor Commissioner.

      <P>The EC proposals on the reorientation of CAP, which have been known to this Government since December, will have major implications for farmers, the food processing sector and the economy generally.  The challenge posed by these changes in EC farm policy and in the GATT negotiations is of fundamental importance and threatens the future viability of thousands of Irish family farms.  As the leader of our party, Deputy Spring, said this morning when he itemised the social and economic consequences of the MacSharry proposals for this country in particular, they are so serious that there must be a political consensus among all the political parties represented in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is refreshing to hear some of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers of recent hours speaking with the voice we had expected, <Col N="1647" /> but it was depressing to hear the Minister in his opening remarks this morning.  I have more confidence in Fianna Fáil backbenchers than I have in their Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the consensus which is coming through from the backbenchers be reproached when one considers that Ireland's national interests are at stake?  In terms of contribution to the economic output of agriculture, it is three and a half times to four times greater and more important to Ireland than to the overall economic Community itself. Agriculture contributes almost a quarter of the gross exports from Ireland and when adjusted for the very low input content of agri-exports the contribution to Ireland's net exports is about 40 per cent.  This has very serious consequences for all of us, whatever political party we represent, if we represent Ireland as a whole.  Ireland's national interests are at stake in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution to the agricultural economy and to direct employment is approximately 15 per cent in Ireland as compared to any other country in the European Community.  This applies to beef, milk, cereals and all the other areas that have been identified.  The contribution of the food industry alone to total employment in manufacturing in Ireland is almost 20 per cent, compared to 8 per cent in the rest of the Community. On these figures, it is true to say that Irish food, agriculture and its industries have the most to gain from the Common Agricultural Policy.  Therefore, with these proposals, this industry and this country had most to lose from the alleged reformed package leaked by the Minister, the Commissioner and the Commission. What will happen to the promises made by the Minister for Agriculture? What has happened to the promise by the Taoiseach that he would bang the table in Luxembourg?  The minutes documented by Deputy Deasy and Deputy J. Bruton today indicated that <Col N="1648" /> the question was not even addressed by the Taoiseach in Luxembourg.  How can we preside over a debate when we do not have confidence in our negotiators, the Minister or the Taoiseach when the Heads of State meet?  We must be categoric in the condemnation of the way they have been handled to date.  We are looking for a consensus but we must, as has been said, support only those battles that will be fought on a level playing pitch and in the interests of this country.  I fear the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Deputy O'Kennedy, reflects a certain degree of incompetence and impotency by this Government.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals will cost the Irish economy in excess of £180 million even after the alleged compensation for smaller farmers is provided.  This country, with an already staggering unemployment rate of up to 25 per cent in many areas, cannot afford the losses which these proposals will result in.  It is estimated that CAP reform will lead to about 16,000 people losing their jobs in the agri-industry.  How could this Government allow the Minister for Agriculture and Food, or any negotiator, to continue in this way unless we state Ireland's position?</P>
    <P>We have had some beneficial documentation from all the farming organisations: ICOS, the ICMSA, the IFA and the United Farmers Association.  They have indicated that in milk there will be a 10 per cent price cut; a 15 per cent cut in beef prices; a 35 per cent cut on cereals going into intervention and a 15 per cent cut in sheep.  It is a continuation of doom and gloom.  The real blame must lie with this Government if they allow these figures to be presented and now agreed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the Irish economy is almost totally dependent on the agri-food industry.  We know that reforms are necessary.  Between 1973 and 1985 real farm incomes, even with CAP as it existed, have remained static while over 60 per cent of farmers' incomes are less than half that of industrial workers. Average incomes for the top 25 per cent of farmers in the EC is 20 times that of <Col N="1649" /> the lower 25 per cent.  There was need for reform.  Forty per cent of gross income for farm families with holdings of less than 30 acres are accounted for by social welfare.  That is a damning condemnation of any system, but let us not throw the baby out with the bath water because there are some points that need to be identified as being in need of reform.  The Common Agricultural Policy needs to be reformed.  The MacSharry proposals &mdash; as Deputy Davern, from my own constituency, has said &mdash; are being sold to the media as being of benefit to small farmers through the compensation process when in fact the economic consequences which have already been identified by Deputy Spring for the rest of those engaged in agriculture and in the economy as a whole are catastrophic.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government &mdash; whether they are Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats is irrelevant because they are our national Government &mdash; that specific agreements were laid down in the Treaty of Rome, in the Treaty of Accession and in the agreement on the milk quotas in 1985.  However, in the Minister's contribution as documented he has stated that the MacSharry proposals are in principle acceptable to him and that it is only the detail he objects to. This is a serious statement to make.  If the Government continue to act on these proposals they are running the risk of alienating the total agricultural community when in the near future they come to the referendum which will be necessary to put into effect the provision of the Single European Act and of the IGC on European monetary union.  That is a risk this Government should not take lightly.</P>
    <P>In the past the farming community have supported membership of the Community, and rightly so, because there was a benefit for them.  Because these issues are being mishandled in our negotiations, whatever benefits might have been there ten or 15 years ago have been eroded by our Commissioner, who has <Col N="1650" /> been allowed to do so by the Government.</P>
    <P>Farmers and many workers know that this issue is of vital interest.  There should be a future for the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy as laid down in the Treaty of Rome.  Farmers and people directly and indirectly employed in agriculture will suffer equally if the Common Agricultural Policy is dismantled in an <i>ad hoc</i> way.  In time the economy and the social structures of every part of this island will be irreparably damaged.  I do not think this House should preside over a debate which cannot reach a unanimous consensus supporting the Government in their attitude to the MacSharry proposals.</P>
    <P>As a result of the measure of support in contributions today, I hope the Minister will feel that his hand is stronger. However, I would prefer his words to be stronger &mdash; at least as strong as those of his backbenchers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two factors of great magnitude and worry to the farming community and the economy as a whole.  One is the reduction in farm incomes over the last 19 months, representing a drop of 22 per cent, which has left a very high proportion of those engaged in agriculture on or below the poverty line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second is the proposed reform to the Common Agriculture Policy. Commissioner MacSharry can at least be commended for giving advance notice to the Government and the farming community of his proposals.  From the moment he announced the proposals in Dromoland Castle I am sure the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government were, metaphorically speaking, on his back to try to change his course of action.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture and Food, his Ministers of State and, possibly, the Taoiseach had numerous meetings with Commissioner MacSharry in Brussels to try to influence him to change course. Was his attitude so arrogant and difficult that they failed in this regard?  The fact that Commissioner MacSharry secured <Col N="1651" /> endorsement for his proposals from the Commission exacerbates the problem.</P>
    <P>The scale of the disaster for Irish agriculture and our economy is fully recognised by all parties.  Today the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, said we can only be concerned at the very significant price cuts proposed for milk, beef and cereals. He also said the further quota reduction in the milk sector, and the ceilings on eligibility for ewe premiums, created major problems for a country such as Ireland which is so heavily dependent on the agriculture and food sector for its total economic wellbeing.  Having committed himself to that realistic statement, one would have expected the Minister to advance positive proposals which would leave no doubt in Commissioner MacSharry's mind &mdash; or in the EC &mdash; about where Ireland stood in relation to these drastic proposals.</P>
    <P>We do not want families to accept compensation to create afforestation on their land; we want a viable, continuing, progressive agricultural industry which is better suited to Ireland than any other country in Europe.</P>

      <P>We are committed to it by tradition and expertise.  The absence of a marker put down in this regard exposes the Minister and his negotiators to the difficulty of shop trading.  The farming community and the economy cannot afford to have any shop trading in these important discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister of State are placing a greater emphasis on the compensatory part of this deal than on protecting the milk quotas, beef prices and cereals.  As Deputy Davern said, if we sell our birth-right for compensation there is no guarantee of permanency or how it will be financed because it is very unlikely that the EC will hand over money to Irish farmers who have gone out of business. They will probably have to depend on the Irish budget which would be unable to support a continuing contribution to <Col N="1652" /> farmers.  We will be destroying our traditional role as viable, expert farmers and joining the dole queues, which are already overcrowded.</P>
    <P>One must mingle with the agricultural community to full realise the impact of price cuts and quota restrictions over the last 19 months.  It has not affected only these individuals and their families, it has spread to the villages and towns, and the people there will tell you that the spending capacity in those areas has been eroded.  All businesses have suffered in these areas.  The agricultural community has sustained schools, churches, voluntary and sporting organisations.  How can the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government stand over a proposal which threatens that type of social fabric?  Time, sweat and effort has been expended in maintaining rural areas.  Will we now sell out to the MacSharry proposal which does not take anything &mdash; except an EC and American perspective &mdash; into account for the future?</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear that the backbenchers totally reject the proposals advanced by Commissioner MacSharry. The Minister should leave no doubt in anybody's mind, here or in any other part of Europe, as to where our Government and people stand.  Nobody knows what disaster could emerge from these discussions.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to speak on the CAP reform.  I wish to recall two interviews I have heard in the past few weeks, interviews with people who know very well about the fabric of society referred to by Deputy Moynihan.  One of those interviewed was Arnold O'Byrne, the Managing Director of Opel Cars in Ireland, who was recently choosing his words and music on a radio programme. When asked about the motor car business, he said that they could be doing <Col N="1653" /> better but that when the farmers were doing well the country was doing well. The other interview which I heard this morning was with the President of the IFA, Alan Gillis, who gave an example of a farmer who earned more than the average industrial wage some years ago but was now earning only half the average industrial wage.  I give those examples to show that there are serious problems in agriculture, and, in the context of discussing the reform of the CAP, they are very serious.</P>
      <P>For that reason the reform we are discussing today is one that should have been considered many years ago.  Blame has been attached particularly to Commissioner MacSharry and the Minister for Agriculture, but if blame is to be apportioned it can be apportioned to many Ministers, many Governments and, indeed, many Commissioners down through the years.</P>
      <P>I am certainly concerned about the cut in milk quotas.  It is proposed that in the milk sector support prices will be reduced by about 10 per cent and that the Commission are also proposing further compensatory cuts in national quotas.  That position is very serious for the country. Even though I understand the figure accepted by the Commission will be 42,725 gallons for exemptions, if the voluntary buy-up scheme is successful, farmers under the quota figure of 42,725 gallons will not be affected by the quota cuts.  The proposed price reductions are also accompanied by compensation of £60 per cow up to 40 cows on every farm. The issue of compensation has been very controversial, and I hope to deal with it later on.</P>
      <P>The small producers are disillusioned &mdash; disillusioned with the EC, with politicians and with the farming organisations. Small producers would say that Commissioner MacSharry is going in the right direction.  My problem is with the actual detail of the CAP reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CAP has been with us since we entered the EC and the country has benefited from it.  Our economy has improved and farmers have received the benefit.  However, we must be realistic <Col N="1654" /> and acknowledge that many schemes introduced were not suitable for the needs of small to medium producers.  The first farm modernisation scheme and the old farm retirement scheme were certainly not suitable.  It was only when Commissioner Ray MacSharry, Minister for Agriculture, and successive Ministers brought in schemes such as the western package, western drainage schemes and the plan under the FEOGA scheme, under which extra money was provided for electrification subsidy to help farmers erecting sheds, farm buildings and even houses, that practical help was given, particularly to farmers in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, who has always negotiated in Europe for the small producers, for younger farmers entering agriculture, for those in hardship and particularly for farmers who have disease within their herds.  Every scheme to be introduced &mdash; the milk restructuring scheme and the milk cessation scheme, for example &mdash; has been a priority.  The 11 million gallons for which the Minister negotiated was also given on that basis to the categories of farmers I have mentioned.  I must add that I was disappointed in that scheme in that farmers under 12,800 gallons expected to receive a larger quota than they actually did receive, but other problems are there that I shall not have time to go into at the moment.</P>
    <P>When I, as a TD from Galway, from the west of Ireland, am fighting the case for the small producer I do not forget that the small producer is dependent on the whole farming scene and, in particular, the commercial farmer.  In the west of Ireland we have traditionally reared livestock that are finished off in other parts of the country, and I am very clear on that point.</P>
    <P>However, a major problem now is that there are farmers with milk quotas as low as 10,000 gallons who are not able to buy milk when it comes on the market, when it is available, through any scheme. Therefore, that has to be given as a free milk quota or a very minimal figure if <Col N="1655" /> those farmers are going to exist in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Coming back to compensation, which has been regarded as a dirty word, we must consider the way in which the funding will come, the length of time involved before it is paid and the amount of money to be received.  Deputy John Bruton talked about Indian reservations.  He may dismiss it all, but there is a cash flow problem.  Farmers apply for social welfare benefits but experience difficulties under the assessment of income criteria. Farmers also wish to have the family income supplement paid to them in the way that it is paid to those in the PAYE low income sector.  All these matters have to be examined.  Why are we calling on Ministers, and particularly the Minister for Agriculture, to get extra headage payments and extra premiums and to get more of Ireland included in the severely handicapped category, if on the one hand we are going to say that we want those grants but on the other hand that we do not want any compensation?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food has already had 1.3 million acres reclassified, that proposal being with the Commission at the moment.  I am very hopeful that County Galway and County Roscommon, the two countries in Connacht not already in that category, will be included in that category on this occasion.  Of course, another almost 2 million acres are to be extended to the severely handicapped classification.  The present proposal, the single biggest reclassification and extension scheme, will be welcomed.  I am sure that every Government since 1975 have been trying to achieve that goal, and I think it will happen now.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that the present CAP represents a big cost to Ireland and to all other European countries.  After giving away as much food as was possible we still find in storage this year 800,000 tonnes of beef, 800,000 tonnes of milk powder, 300,000 tonnes of butter and 20,000 tonnes of cereal &mdash; all that at a cost of £7 billion.  It is certainly well past the time for this reform.  All I say here, <Col N="1656" /> as a backbench TD from the west of Ireland, is that I support our Minister, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, in what he has been doing to achieve benefits for farmers and particularly the small producers. I know that our Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, who was an excellent Minister for Finance and an excellent Minister for Agriculture, will keep the Irish interest as well as the European interest before the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us in the House are only too well aware of the difficulties farmers have faced in the past number of years with falling prices and the decline in farm income.  As a consequence, we have, unfortunately, had to note that several family farms are no longer viable. There has been what could be described as a drift or, indeed, a flight from the land.  Very many young people who, given the opportunity, would want to stay on the land are not able to do so because their family farm is no longer viable. That situation has to be halted because it erodes the whole social fabric and rural life.</P>
      <P>No one would disagree that the Common Agricultural Policy must be reformed and needs to be reformed.  The situation in Eastern Europe along with the GATT and the many failures of the existing Common Agricultural Policy, particularly in the area of over-production, has made these changes inevitable.  Indeed, from 1979 I witnessed, as a Member of the European Parliament, many attempts at trying to erode the Common Agricultural Policy by interest groups outside the farming sector. So we have been well aware for very many years that those interested groups that have their own axe to grind have been trying to erode the CAP and in so doing have eroded the whole situation of the family farm in Ireland in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While such changes are necessary, we have to ensure that the family farm is no longer under threat, that it becomes a viable unit and is not only maintained but promoted.  None of us needs to be told of the importance of the agricultural community and the work they do for the <Col N="1657" /> whole economy of Ireland.  Any reforms that are to take place ought to respect Ireland's vital interests and safeguard the family farm.  A phase that was used here earlier this morning by the Minister for Agriculture and Food which needs to be underlined emphasises the importance of reform of the CAP.  He said that what we should be talking about is family farms versus factory farms.  That small reference underlines the very kernal of the debate here this evening.  We have to ensure that the family farm is allowed to continue and that the opportunities are given to those on the family farms to have a lifelihood.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reforms are concentrating at present on cereals, beef and dairying.  Coming from the west and representing a constituency such as County Clare, I want to underline the comments made by Deputy Michael Kitt that the rumoured further cuts in milk quotas would have a very serious effect on the whole economy of County Clare and the surrounding areas.  That is something we could not support.</P>
    <P>The agri-food sector is extremely important to the whole Irish economy as it provides outlets for our agricultural products.  We rely so much on our exports and our agricultural exports are of extreme importance to the whole economy. Also, the agriculture sector and the agri-food sector give great employment at manufacturing and processing levels. In fact, the many rumours that abound at present about the job losses that may be in the offing as a result of these proposals in regard to the CAP are, to say the least, frightening.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on food quality and environmental image is particularly important to Ireland.  We put a great deal of positive emphasis on our environmental image; and it is something that can be promoted and should help our whole marketing image of the agricultural produce of this country.  The range of structural measures, including early retirement, forestry and environment friendly farming practices, can only be seen to be complementary to the existing social fabric in rural Ireland, <Col N="1658" /> which revolves around the family farm. What I would be worried about at this juncture is the whole question and procedure of any reforms that take place within the European structures and institutions. We all know that there will be a transitional period and this is where we need to be ever vigilant.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposals being put forward by the Commission at the moment, obviously we are all concerned and anxious.  I certainly would oppose the Commission's proposals as put forward. I would certainly support Deputy Noel Davern in what he said about income supplements.  What the Irish farmer wants is to be able to be in a position to run a viable farm, to carry out his work and simply to get a fair price for the produce from his land.  He is not looking for handouts; and any such handouts without giving the family farmer an opportunity to run a viable industry would have a very negative impact psychologically, socially and, in the end, financially.</P>
    <P>I want to refer in particular to the role of the Commissioner, Commissioner Ray MacSharry.  A Commissioner has to represent the views of the whole Commission in whatever portfolio he happens to have.  In Ireland our responsibility is to make sure that the Irish interest is at all times paramount.  In this situation, or in any other situation where there happens to be a grave difference of opinion between us and the Commission on what is being proposed in regard to the Common Agricultural Policy reforms, what we have to do is to fight for the interests of the family farm and in so doing fight for the interests of the social fabric of this country.</P>

      <P>It is clear, Sir, that any policy as important and as comprehensive <Col N="1659" /> as the Common Agriculture Policy must be open to continuing and ongoing review, reform and change.  I have to say, however, that I am not at all impressed by the views now being expressed by Fianna Fáil MEPs saying that we somehow missed the opportunity for review and change in previous years.  I am particularly smitten by two MEPs, Mr. Mark Killilea and Mr. Paddy Lane, who are now saying that we should have been talking about these reforms years ago when in fact &mdash; and I have a very clear recollection of it &mdash; between 1982 and 1987 they were both &mdash; one of them as a Member of this House and the other as a very high officer in one of our major organisations &mdash; saying that the price increases we were getting then were not sufficient and that the payments we were getting for our produce were not sufficient. They were not looking for reform; they were looking for as much as we could get from the Common Agricultural Policy; and no amount of protest on their side these days will turn them into latter day saints and apostles of reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say, too, Sir, that I have no patience these days with armchair experts, most of them suburban, comfortable and middle class, who go around saying that there was something intrinsically wrong about the fact that between 1970 and 1990 farm incomes around this country came &mdash; for once in generations &mdash; to levels that were near the kind of industrial wage that we see.  I have no regrets whatsoever that in those 20 years our farming communities discovered what the consumer society was all about, found themselves in a position to educate their children the way they wanted to, found themselves in a position to look after their elderly the way they wanted to, found themselves in a position where they could have living standards that approached those of the rest of the community.  I do not think we should regret any of that.  It should make us all the more determined to ensure that whatever change we see in agricultural policies from here on out will retain, as far as we can do it, the ability of our rural <Col N="1660" /> population to stay in touch with the rest of the world in all of those ways.</P>
    <P>The reform process, however, is one that should be based on the needs of the Community that the policy serves, and that is not what is happening in the European Community today.  What is happening in the European Community today is that the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is being driven by the GATT, it is being driven by the interests of the United States and of the CAIRNS group of countries, not by the interests of farmers in Ireland or in any other part of the Community.  The reason that the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is being driven by GATT is simply because &mdash; we do not have to search far to find it &mdash; Commissioner Ray MacSharry got outmanoeuvred and duped last year.  He made a totally uncalled for and unwise unilateral offer of a reduction of 30 per cent in support levels and the people on the other side of the table took that as being simply his opening gambit.  It gave them a taste for blood. They came back for more, and they will keep on looking for more.  It is even more sinister and worrying than that.</P>
    <P>I am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that Commissioner MacSharry was taken in by Commissioner Andriessen, who has been running a second secret agenda looking for bigger cuts in Community price supports in order to get concessions in the area he is interested in. Commissioner MacSharry fell for that hook, line and sinker.  I have no doubt that there is a strong body of opinion in the Commission that, as Deputy Bruton said, was reflected in the communique from the last summit in Luxembourg, and wants to see agreement on GATT at almost any price, and they will not be too particular about what is done to Community agriculture and Irish agriculture in order to get that agreement.</P>
    <P>It is very much an aside in the present discussion, but one of the ironies in all this is that the people who most need reform in world trade, the agricultural exporters in Third World countries, do not get a single brass farthing from any of this.  The CAP or GATT reforms being <Col N="1661" /> talked about now will not be of any great benefit to Third World countries who can now export.  The reforms will be of still less benefit to Third World countries who cannot export agricultural produce.  We are going through all of this not to benefit the European Community, not to benefit the European consumers or taxpayers, not to benefit European farmers but to benefit commercial interests of North America, Australia and New Zealand who are far from being Third World countries.  The Commission and the Government are conspiring in that.</P>
    <P>The Commission have proposed a series of price cuts and the claim is being made that they will be offset for 90 per cent of Irish farmers by the compensation measures that go with them.  There is not any change that 90 per cent of Irish farmers who will be affected will be compensated. Let us look at the measures being proposed.  There will be compulsory quota cuts for dairy farmers with quotas of more than 42,725 gallons, but they will be accompanied by price reductions so that in practical terms dairy farmers with herds of 40 cows will find themselves in greater difficulty than they are experiencing today.  Those of us with any knowledge or acquaintance with what it is like to have to earn one's living on a farm in Ireland today know that a farm family depending for their living on a 40 cow dairy herd is far from living in palatial circumstances.  Now it is apparently intended to redistribute some of those quotas.  That will mean that farmers who have herds with perhaps 20 or 30 cows will have increased quotas but will get less for their milk.  With their quota today they cannot make a reasonable living.  Now they will have a slightly bigger quota but less of an income.  The compensation measures will not encourage those people to go out in the streets to cheer for the new salvation that is breaking for them today.</P>
    <P>The Minister said today that for these compensation measures, particularly in the dairy sector, the Commission have proposed what he calls an innovative measure.  What will that be?  We have been told there will be the payment of <Col N="1662" /> compensation and of these proposed cessation premia by way of guaranteed bonds.  Where did we hear that before? Who remembers the land bonds?  These payments will be made by guaranteed bonds and we must ask why they will not be paid in real cash.  I get very suspicious when a public authority of any kind decide to pay people in bonds rather than in cash, because the only reason a public authority would do that is because it would be cheaper for them.  If it is cheaper for the public authorities it is worse for the people who will be paid in bonds.  I see dangers for farmers in this. They will be fobbed off with bonds instead of getting cash up front and they will find the bonds are worth much less than the value of the compensation that is being peddled to us by the Minister and the Commission.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to reduce by up to 15 per cent support prices for beef.  Here compensation is to be limited to the first 90 livestock units and to what are called extensive producers, defined as those with maximum stocking rates of more than 1.4 livestock units per hectare in the disadvantaged areas and more than two livestock units per hectare elsewhere.  An output of 90 livestock units is not a very big output for a drystock farm.  I wonder if they are hectares, acres, map acres, forage acres or adjusted acres.  They make quite a difference.  What does the Minister think about the cut in stocking rates?  A stocking rate of 1.4 livestock units per hectare is 0.56 livestock units per acre.  Outside the disadvantaged areas a stocking rate of two livestock units per hectare is 0.8 livestock units per acre.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister not aware that many farmers in the disadvantaged areas, and outside, are small farmers who are doing much better than that in terms of the rate at which they stock their land.  Those farmers, through their ability, through spending money on their land and on housing for their livestock, have increased the effective carrying capacity of their land and they will now find themselves defined as large farmers and will be outside the scope of the compensation <Col N="1663" /> arrangements.  One will find such farmers in my constituency, in the middle of the Bog of Allen, in east Galway, in west Mayo and in east and west Clare.  One does not have to go far to find farmers, inside and outside disadvantaged areas, with small farms who are doing better in terms of their stocking rates than the Commission now arbitrarily defines as the line between a small farmer and a big farmer.  They will be denied compensation. That brings our compensation figure below the 90 per cent claimed by the Minister and the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission are proposing a reduction of 35 per cent in support prices for cereals over three years and there is another definition of a small producer.  A small producer is any cereal producer who has less than 50 hectares, 125 acres, of cereals.  It is difficult enough, even at today's prices, to make a living from 125 acres of cereals.  With prices going down by 25 per cent over three years it will be nigh impossible from now on.  I can see little prospect that these regionalised acreage premiums will take up the slack of the producers with less than 150 acres of cereals.  Those with more than 125 acres will receive what are called &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; payments.  It is a grand idea and farmers in the US are familiar with them. But, there is a limit.  Farmers will get set aside payments for a maximum of 7.5 hectares, about 19 acres.  If we add those 19 acres to the 125 acres we find that cereal farmers with more than 140 acres of cereal will be cut out of any compensation payments, will get no &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; payments and will have the benefit of a 35 per cent reduction in support prices over three years.  Where is the 90 per cent compensation for the farmers who will be affected? It will not be there.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us where the money for these alleged compensation measures is to come from.  Is all of it to come from the European Community?  If it is, it will not go anywhere near meeting compensation for 90 per cent of our farmers. The one thing we can be perfectly sure of, though, is that if the money does <Col N="1664" /> not all come from the European Community, less than 90 per cent of farmers will get much less than would compensate them for what they are going to go through.  We know perfectly well &mdash; the headage payments and all the previous schemes are there to back this up &mdash; that the Irish Exchequer will not meet the full amount for the payments which will fall to be made.</P>
    <P>Many Fianna Fáil Members have contributed to the debate, but we have not heard any speaker from the Progressive Democrats.  I see Deputy Quill in the House.  I hope this means we will hear what the Progressive Democrats have to say about all this.  We are told that they are the tail which wags the dog.  I should like to hear how they will wag the dog on these issues.  The dog needs a lot of wagging as he is not awake yet in regard to these issues.</P>

We will be back here listening to the Minister trying to put the best face he can on it and explaining that this was the best on offer.  The 90 per cent of the farmers who will be affected by these proposals will be looking to see where compensation will come from.  They will see that it is certainly not coming from the Irish Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I want to know what all the Fianna Fáil backbenchers and Progressive Democrats are going to do about the issue then. The Progressive Democrats have not yet said anything about these proposals but they speak like an Opposition party all the time.</P>

      <P>As I said, the MacSharry proposals are not yet a reality.  Yet Irish agriculture is in turmoil.  There is an abundance of evidence to support this &mdash; for example, the Teagasc survey, which shows that farming incomes have decreased by 11 per cent.  Those of us from agricultural communities do not need surveys to tell us about the extent of the crisis in Irish agriculture.  Anyone who sits in a cattle mart and watches the &ldquo;must sell&rdquo; face of a farmer and knows about the collapse in beef prices is only too well aware of the crisis in agriculture. Those of us who have attended meetings organised by farm organisations on the disadvantaged areas scheme are only too well aware of the crisis.</P>
      <P>On that issue, I ask the Minister to come out from behind the Official Secrets Act and publish the survey so that we can see whether, as he alleges, all is well and it was not political interference which led to the exclusion of areas which met all the criteria.</P>

Will this be the last generation of farmers to farm the land of Ireland?  The old sayings, who would bring calves from cows, who would bring bonhams from sows and who would be in Ireland now, have a very familiar ring in these circumstances.  That is the challenge facing us and pious platitudes, lip service, incompetence, indifference and inability will no longer suffice.

      <P>We in Ireland wish to be good Europeans.  Therefore, we must rally to the treaty of Rome.  Article 37 of that Treaty enshrines the importance of a common agricultural policy.  We must stand firm against bureaucrats who wish to return to national governments the question of agricultural policy.  If this were to happen we would be the losers. Renationalisation of European agriculture would not be in the best interests of the EC for political, economic and social reasons.  Germany is already subsidising its farmers to the tune of £2 billion per annum.  How can we compete with this?</P>
      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy aims to ensure a fair standard of living for farmers and a reasonable supply to consumers with stable agricultural markets. It has done that by working towards the completion of an internal market and, more importantly, towards the principle of Community preference, which has been eroded completely by developments in Eastern Europe and the unification of Germany.  Germany's concern at ensuring stability in Eastern Europe is allowing unfettered amounts of agricultural produce into the EC.  This is undermining our position in the EC.</P>

I expect the Government to stand up to these proposals, which will have a disastrous effect on agriculture, a vital component of our economy.</P>
      <P>The agricultural industry stretches far beyond the farm gates.  It is vital to our economy and thousands of jobs depend on agricultural related industries.  It is also vital to the economies of rural towns. I hold no brief for Commissioner MacSharry.  As someone said earlier, he is an EC Commissioner and has a job to be.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> As politicans we have a job to do on behalf of Irish farmers.  I welcome the concern expressed by the Taoiseach and the Minister at these proposals and the statement by the Minister that the intends to oppose them.  It is only right that he should receive the support of all sides of this House and of farming organisations, employers and trade unions in opposing these proposals.  We have to fight these proposals together.  These proposals do not relate to one section of our community only; they will affect all sections of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's special dependence on agriculture must be taken into account by our European counterparts and by the Commission.  We must insist that future <Col N="1669" /> Community agricultural policy respects Ireland's dependency on agriculture and the right of family farmers to remain on the land and have a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the need to keep farmers on the land and the need to maintain a son or daughter on the family farm.  However, some of the proposals made by the Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, will ensure that this will not happen.  Given that jobs are not available in urban areas for farmers who may decide to leave the land, it is vitally important that the fact that Ireland is dependent on agriculture is taken into account in restructuring agriculture within the European Community.</P>
    <P>In the main we have only family farmers. We have no ranchers, which is the case in France and Germany, and it is they who are responsible for creating the surpluses we have heard so much about. We have been informed today that there are thousands of tonnes of agricultural products in storage throughout the European Community, but it should be spelled out loud and clear here today that our farmers are not responsible for creating those surpluses and should not now be penalised.</P>
    <P>I come from a county far from the west where there has been much talk about the plight of its small farmers.  Wexford would be regarded as a major farming county.  It has been said that we have wealthy farmers in County Wexford, who have often been described as commercial farmers; but I wish to make it clear that the farmers in my county, who are among the most progressive in the country, are not making the kind of money some people think they are.  Indeed, the position is changing.  At a meeting recently I was presented with figures by the IFA &mdash; Deputy Yates was given the same figures &mdash; which indicate that there are over 3,000 non-viable farms in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>One should not talk about commercial farmers in Ireland but rather about family farmers who are trying to eke out a living. Many farmers in my own county will be <Col N="1670" /> put out of business if they are not protected from the proposals made by Mr. MacSharry.  I expect the Minister for Agriculture and Food to make sure that family farmers in County Wexford, who provide up to 10 per cent of national output, are protected and find themselves in a position where they can eke out a decent living and provide jobs for members of their family on their farms.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the MacSharry plan will benefit small farmers, given that various measures will be introduced to compensate them.  What assurances have we received that such measures will be permanent?  Is there not a danger that once the package has been accepted these will be withdrawn due to budgetary constraints? This matter is a source of serious concern to me.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that farms should be taken out of production.  One must ask the question: if farms were to be taken out of production what effect would this have on the agri-food industry and where would they obtain their raw material?  Would we see food processing industries being closed down, with consequent job losses?  We are already faced with a serious unemployment problem and it is unacceptable for a Commissioner or the Commission to put forward proposals which would lead to industries being closed down, with consequent job losses.</P>
    <P>The package makes no sense to me. We must get back to the principle of Community preference &mdash; in other words, we should look after ourselves first.  We must get rid of cheap imports, such as New Zealand butter and lamb.  In addition, imports of cheap strawberries from Eastern Europe pose a serious threat to farmers who grow strawberries in County Wexford.  These farmers do not know what the position will be next year in view of the fact that one major processing company has stopped buying strawberries in County Wexford because they can buy them more cheaply from Eastern Europe.  We should get our own house in order in the European Community and ban cheap imports to protect our own farmers and communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> We accept that there is a need for changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.  We have seen farmers diversify into agri-tourism and deer farming.  In addition, integrated rural development programmes and the new Leader programme have been introduced.  I wish to compliment the Minister for initiating these programmes, but at the end of the day all the majority of farmers want to know about is tillage, beef and dairy farming.  These are the areas which must be protected by the Government.  Any proposals which seek to introduce changes in those areas should be strongly resisted.</P>
    <P>Those farmers who are capable of maintaining their families on their farms should be allowed to continue to do so. I have no hang-ups about seeking family income supplement for small farmers who are unable to generate a decent weekly income at present.  We have many such farmers and we have to look after them.  We must make sure that no restrictions are placed upon them by the European Community.</P>
    <P>It has been the tradition that farmers do not look for hand-outs.  Many are entitled to social welfare benefits but they are too proud to claim them; all they want to do is get on with the task of earning a living on their farms.  They should be complimented for this.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who has received the support of all sides of the House, will return to Brussels to say that the MacSharry proposals are unacceptable to our farmers and that we will do all we can to protect their interests and to ensure that they are allowed to remain on the land and earn a decent living with which to maintain their families.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for giving me some of his time to make a short contribution this evening.  The first matter we must consider is what effect the proposed changes will have on our agricultural industry.  It is clear that the proposals which were officially <Col N="1672" /> announced last night will devastate agriculture, with a major portion of the land being taken out of production and used for forestry, be if hardwoods or Sitka spruce.  The proposal that the stocking rate should be 1.4 livestock units per hectare in the disadvantaged areas is unacceptable, given that at present production rates the figure would be closer to two livestock units per hectare and in some cases the figure would be even higher.  Any proposal which would force people to cut back rather than to expand would lead to farming being turned on the top of its head, given that if such a proposal were to be accepted there would be no room for expansion. Farmers who find themselves in a <i>cul de sac</i> do not get the best return.  Such a proposal would have a detrimental effect on rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The proposals with regard to afforestation on agricultural land are totally unacceptable.  At present farmers in disadvantaged areas are not allowed to compete with the private forestry companies. Many small farmers are being forced out of business because adjacent farms, which they might be able to buy if sold at any economic price, are being bought up by insurance companies and the banks.  Farmers who wish to deal with them in an effort to buy the land find in some cases that a premium as high as 50 per cent is sought in coming to a settlement. This is wrong and the proposals which emanated from yesterday's meeting in Strasbourg will absolutely devastate the small farmers in the west.  We have a duty to protest vigorously against the proposed changes with regard to afforestation.  It is time that farmers were allowed to compete on a level playing field with private forestry companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look at the effect of the proposed changes on agri-industry.  The effect on co-operatives and food processors would be disastrous.  Many of the co-operatives would go out of business and our processors would operate at half capacity, leaving us totally ineffective in the market place.  This sector must be <Col N="1673" /> protected in the interests of the national economy.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement regarding the social effects of the proposals.  They would devastate rural life and the Minister has a duty, as has every Member, to oppose vigorously the MacSharry proposals. They are not suitable and are unacceptable.  We must be open about that.</P>

      <P>For a number of years it has been quite clear that there were major problems with the Common Agricultural Policy and that sooner or later proposals would be put forward to reform it.  The proposals that have been <Col N="1674" /> announced by the Commission are not favourable to the farmers of this country but it is important that we approach the issue with a cool head and that we cooperate to prepare our case properly. There will be long days of difficult negotiations and we must work to ensure that the farmers and the whole rural community will not be decimated.</P>
      <P>Factory farming has been one of the main causes of over-production.  We in Ireland are taking the blame for a problem which we have not caused.  The majority of our farms are family farms and the Minister made it quite clear that he would fight to ensure that such farms would be maintained.  He stated:</P>
      <P>In particular I have stressed the important role of agriculture as the dynamo in Ireland's total economy and have left my colleagues in no doubt about my requirement that the reform must respect Ireland's vital interests and afford the fullest safeguards for the future to all categories of family farmers.  I have cautioned against adjustments which go beyond the strict needs of market and budgetary requirements and have insisted that the revised CAP must continue to respect the provisions of Article 39 of the Rome Treaty.</P>
      <P>Members should note that statement.  We on this side of the House are not responsible for the proposals of the European Commission.  We are making our views known through our representative, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who will convey those views in Europe when the negotiations begin.  I have the fullest confidence that he will not sell this country down the tubes.</P>
      <P>The proposed reductions in support prices for milk, beef, cereals and sheep and the cuts in quotas would, if implemented, decimate the countryside. They would affect not only farmers but those who depend on income from farmers, such as small garages, shops and accountants.  The farming scene was good in the years up to 1989 and while 1990 was not bad the trend was downwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pollution control has been an extra <Col N="1675" /> burden on farmers in recent years and many of them had to take out loans to comply with stringent regulations introduced by local authorities.  Most of those farmers would have been able to repay such loans but these proposals mean that many of them will be put out of business.</P>
    <P>Many schemes of compensation have been mentioned during the years but U-turns have been done.  This is a fear I would have in this instance where such vast amounts of money are being mentioned. We should not pin our hopes on this aspects of the proposals.</P>
    <P>The Minister will take note of the views expressed on all sides of the House. Clearly there is agreement on this issue. The proposals as published last night are not acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important debate but when agriculture and farming matters are debated a large proportion of the public, the media and Members of this House are totally switched off.  It is absolutely vital that the gravity of this matter should be understood.  This is not exclusively about farming and agriculture; it is a matter concerning jobs. It has been conservatively estimated by ICOS that 16,000 jobs will be lost in the food industry and 22,000 direct farming jobs will be lost.  That will impact so severely on our economy and on the social fabric that it will affect everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an outstanding case for Irish derogation.  Ireland accounts for only 1 per cent of the EC population and 3 per cent of total European agricultural production. We are but a blip in the overall European consumer market.  We did not cause the crisis, the budgetary overruns or the surplus of food products.  Therefore we must seek derogation.  We must accept the reality of the Uruguay Round of GATT talks.  After a while people see the illogicality of trade wars and move <Col N="1676" /> towards trade agreements.  This applies whether it is Quinnsworth and Dunnes Stores or American and Europe.  Obviously Irish farmers and European farmers are to be the sacrifical lambs.</P>
    <P>We must accept there will be reform of the CAP, but we must seek exemption because of our unique dependence on agriculture.  Over the last 20 years we have seen the development of what was commonly known as the golden triangle, whereby white and blue collar employment and investment have moved towards central Europe at the expense of the peripheral regions.  The peripheral regions must servive and must close the income gap between the richest and poorest.  That means that we must be allowed develop our strengths.  One of our strengths is grass-based agricultural production.  These proposals to reform the CAP could not be more damaging because a cheap cereal based policy will displace grass based production and destroy the Irish beef and milk sectors. We must seek a derogation because a total of 19 per cent of Irish employment, 24 per cent of exports and 11 per cent of GDP are dependent on the food sector.</P>
    <P>I have no confidence whatsoever in the Minister for Agriculture and Food fighting tooth and nail.  We will hear he has resisted it up to the very last, that there have been three adjourned meetings and then we will switch on our radios one morning to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and hear a hazy Minister from Brussels in total capitulation, saying he did the best deal possible.</P>

      <P>Gabh mo leathscéal.  The House accepts that we are not in Croke Park or Central Park. There is no special merit in shouting across at one another.

      <P>I will sustain that political point by quoting the Taoiseach, who said recently in Brussels that he thanks God every day since he made the decision to appoint Ray MacSharry Commissioner for Agriculture in Europe.  We know that a drop of 15p in the £ for beef will mean not only that Irish beef producers will lose a fortune this year but that there will be a collapse of store prices.  We know sheep farmers are now taking £24 for their lambs when they were making £44 two years ago.  We know of the quota <Col N="1678" /> cuts.  Unless we gain the exemption we need we will not servive as an overall peripheral economy, and the only way that can be done is to take it up not at Council of Ministers level but at summit level.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton, Leader of the Opposition, rightly said that we should have agreement that there will be no national supports for farmers among their own member states.  We see the VAT refunds the West Germans have and what the Danes and others have done to help their farmers and not least the French.  We must ensure that the first principle is that there will be no national protection, that proper stock will be taken of imports from non-EC countries, that there will be a clear point of Community preference and that in areas where there is no self-sufficiency there will be adequate deficiency payments. The compensation we are speaking of at the moment is of the order of £900 in lieu of £3,500 of market support for an average beef or dairy farmer of about 70 acres.  They say 90 per cent of farmers will be compensated; at what level will they be compensated?  That is the key question.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has been too preoccupied with photo opportunities at these summits and he has missed the opportunity to engage in real dialogue. Our party through the Christian Democratic group and the European People's Party will ensure that that message of our complete dependence on agriculture will get through.  I know many other Deputies are wishing to contribute, so I conclude on this note.  I hope the message will go clearly to not only our European partners but to the Taoiseach that unless he personally pursues a political and diplomatic initiative in this regard, Ireland's case will be lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that, as a public representative of an urban area, I speak on this issue.  Very often in the past the CAP has been seen as a rural, farming problem and PAYE workers and urban dwellers have regarded it as a large complaining session by farmers.  Now people throughout the country in either town or rural areas will begin to grasp the seriousness of what is ahead for Ireland if we reach the incredible and unacceptable situation of people being compensated and being paid for not working, for not producing, for making use of land and resources that were, through climate and environment, designated for the production of rich produce.  We have and it is hoped we will continue to protect and support an environment that should allow us to produce food of an excellence of standard which many other countries have lost the potential to achieve.  The cutbacks proposed to be applied to farmers will not alone be a denial of everything that is productive and creative; they will change the quality of life here forever, and not just in rural and farming communities but for urban dwellers as well.</P>
      <P>To be totally selfish and self-centred, I want to point out the demographic problems and the changes that will come about if farming families and rural communities are broken up and try to seek opportunities in urban areas which are not ample for those already residing there.  We cannot cope with that.  That drastic, fundamental change will damage the whole quality of life as we know it in Ireland.  It will leave people isolated in rural areas to an extent even greater than we can envisage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are areas of isolation and loneliness in Ireland today that are a matter of concern.  Consider the cost of trying to cope in economic terms with the kind of services and supports we would have to introduce if we devastate farming families and communities without taking into <Col N="1680" /> consideration the human waste and the whole fabric of life, if I may use a term which is often plagiarised.  We are talking about the fabric of life as we all know it. That is not to say that there is no need for change and innovation.  I would like to think that out of this crisis will come a concentration and a sence of urgency on the part of all of us.  The farming community should not be left to cope with this alone.  We should demand that, for instance, all funding be directed as quickly as possible towards farming, the services sector and the leisure industry, as has been done up to now in the manufacturing sector, sometimes with disastrous results and certainly not the response which would equal the heavy investment in that sector.</P>
    <P>A structural change is necessary but, above all, we must fight for the kind of future to which we have a right.  It is not that there are no markets available. There is a market abroad for our excellent food if we produce it.  There is a global market, and this is where immortality comes in.  This short term MacSharry solution is part of the problem. How can anyone come up with such short term drastic solution like this when so much of the world lies waste with desert, is ravaged by famine and drought and while millions of people are dying from malnutrition and starvation?  The countries in Europe joined together to bring about a sense of cohesion and vision not just of Europe but of the world.  If we accept this proposal we will be selling out not just on Ireland and Europe but on a world that needs the kind of constructive production Europe is capable of.</P>

      <P>I had more to say on this matter but I will conclude.  We should focus on the role of women in agriculture. Much of the agri-business that will save farm incomes here is being carried on <Col N="1681" /> in a small, unacknowledged and badly-funded way by women, particularly rural women.  I hope Members listening to me realise that the greatest potential for innovation, adaption and energy here lies in the women in rural areas and in rural development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Yates and Barnes for giving me an opportunity to make my voice heard in defence of the people who have built this country, the farmers.  I thank in particular Deputy Barnes, an urban Deputy, for her excellent contribution.  It shows the nationwide concern about the announcement by a former Member of this House, Commissioner MacSharry, which will have a devastating effect on the farming community. I compliment Deputies Yates and Barnes on their excellent contributions. I was somewhat heartened today by some of the comments from Fianna Fáil backbench Deputies, but on hearing the truth spelled out by Members on this side of the House I began to lose hope again.  I was disappointed with the Minister's contribution.  His statement was, to say the least, woolly, and I will come back to it in a moment.</P>
      <P>I was a candidate in the local elections and during the campaign had reason to visit farming families.  I grew up on a farm and I fully appreciate the difficulties being experienced by farmers at present. I was devastated at the pain, anger and real suffering on the faces of honest, decent people who want nothing more than to pay their way.  These people have made a commitment and have responded to the demands of the EC, only to find that our Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Commissioner for Agriculture are hell bent on penalising them for their efforts.  It is nothing short of a national disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the pugilistic sport of heavyweight boxing, when one boxer is down on the canvas his opponent moves to a neutral corner until he gets to his feet.  In the game of football if a player is down his colleagues gather around to help, but beware of the person who puts in the boot when his colleague or opponent is <Col N="1682" /> on the ground.  All sides would boo such a person off the field.  The referee would take out the red card, the person's name would be taken, he would be sent off the pitch and would not be allowed play again for 12 months or, in the case of a serious incident, for life.  Commissioner MacSharry, by his actions last night, put in the boot when the farmers of this country were on their knees, and that is not acceptable.  The red card must be issued to him and to the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy.  They must be removed from the playing field and substituted by people who have the confidence to deal with the problems we face.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister stated that the average farm income for 1990 was £6,580.  However the average industrial wage was £11,253.  Members on the Government side will say that farmers are doing well and can afford to take further cuts.  How far removed are they from reality?  Have they gone on their holidays or do they ever meet their constituents? That is not acceptable.  The Minister spoke about headage payments and compensation.  That is farming through the postman, and it is not what farmers want.  They want to work their farms and produce goods for which there is a market, but we have not the people with the ability to market the products. I referred to that in a recent debate on trade and marketing in this House and I will not elaborate on it this evening.  The Minister said that the premium payable would be limited to those with 1.4 livestock units per hectare or, when spelt out clearly, one cow to every two acres.  For anything above that the farmer will not receive payment but will be penalised. That is the sad fact in regard to headage payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about marketing our beef and dairy produce.  Time and again I have referred to the abuse by a small number of cowboys who use the dreaded angel dust and jungle juice.  The Minister replied that he would be firm and intended taking action against those people, but what has he done?  He has not done anything.  It is common knowledge <Col N="1683" /> that a number of factories here are quoting premium prices for cattle treated with angel dust or jungle juice.  It is common knowledge that cowboy farmers, large beef producers, are pushing those cattle though the system because the personnel are not available and legislation is not sufficient to deal with them.  Nothing is being done about this.  This is not good enough if we want to establish our name in Europe as a prime food producer.</P>
    <P>There is a market for our produce and that has been proved by Bord Bainne whose official, Joe McGeough, set out a marketing strategy which resulted in an Irish dairy product &mdash; Kerrygold &mdash; gaining worldwide recognition.  We need people with dynamism and ability. Unfortunately &mdash; I wish the Minister was present to hear this &mdash; Deputy O'Kennedy is not the man to do the job.  He is a nice man to meet in the corridors or on official business down the country, but he is too close to Commissioner MacSharry to oppose the proposals put forward by him.  That man forgot from where he came, the small farms of Leitrim where he was very glad to live and get votes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals agreed yesterday by the EC Commission and <Col N="1684" /> announced by Commissioner MacSharry are of a kind unknown up to now in the history of the CAP.</P>
      <P>They have not come as a surprise.  The changes in the CAP foreshadowed from the early eighties, with high surplus stocks and increasing budgetary costs, came to a head with the introduction of quotas in the milk sector in 1984.  Other changes in the CAP followed as the eighties moved on, giving some temporary relief.  These changes also brought with them their own problems.  Within this country we all know too well the distortions at farm level brought about by the rigid milk quota system.</P>
      <P>Other issues outside of and wider than the CAP began to take effect &mdash; the GATT negotiations, movement towards economic and monetary union, changes in Eastern Europe &mdash; all these began to put more pressure on the Common Agricultural Policy.  At the same time we had within agriculture the problem of increasing costs and surpluses, the limits on budgetary expenditure coming from the Heads of State Agreement of 1988 and the fact that despite all that was being done to solve ongoing problems in many countries, including our own, there were serious falls taking place in farm income.</P>
      <P>The Commission proposals of yesterday are the next step in this development. But they are only a step.  Despite the wide-ranging changes being proposed what we are looking at are still only proposals that have yet to be considered by the European Parliament and the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  There will be many long negotiating sessions before anything is finalised.  It is fairly safe to assume, I think, that the Heads of State will become involved before final decisions are taken.</P>
      <P>In all of these debates this Government will leave nobody in any doubt at meetings of the Council or at the Heads of State that to this country agriculture has been more important in the past, continues to be more important and will remain more important for our national prosperity and well-being than it does for any other country of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> We cannot accept that the agriculture policy of the Community should do damage to our well-being and prosperity. We joined the Community very willingly as members of a new European order but we knew and so did everybody else in Europe know of the importance to us of agriculture.  Whatever arguments there might be about ups and downs for year to year since 1973, there is no doubt that the country has gained very substantially from the Common Agriculture Policy.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Commissioner's proposals there will be changes.  These are inevitable given the budget and market difficulties now facing the Community. It will be the job of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, to see to it that Irish agriculture is not damaged by these changes.  Tens of thousands of farm families throughout the country and the great number of workers whose jobs depend on agriculture should not have their livelihoods put in jeopardy.  The Government will endeavour to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>In the debate a number of Deputies have complained that we have not already quantified the Commission's proposals having regard to the fact that these have been widely leaked over recent months.  The fact is that the proposals adopted by the Commission yesterday are complex and differ substantially in a number of very important aspects from those contained in the leaked document earlier this year.  I would, however, wish to assure the House that my Department have already commenced an assessment and as provided in the PESP we will be presenting the results to the relevant organisations.</P>
    <P>The Minister was also criticised for saying that we were not necessarily opposed to the Commission's intentions in relation to reform.  Apart altogether from the fact that this statement was taken in isolation and without reference to his statement that we had major difficulty with the details or to the very detailed outline of the elements which we will have to present for the outcome of <Col N="1686" /> the negotiations to be broadly acceptable, it is worth considering what the Commission's intentions are.  They are broadly designed to: retain sufficient numbers of farmers on the land; provide that farmers would have the dual function of producing food and protecting the environment in the interest of rural development; control production to the degree necessary to bring markets back into balance; ensure a more equitable distribution of Community support while taking account of the difficult situations of certain categories of producers and regions; and maintain the basic principles of the CAP as provided in Article 39 of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House could object to these principles.  Our difficulty is with the way that the Commission proposes to implement them.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made it very clear that CAP reform and GATT negotiations should take place in parallel.  In this regard, the Commission in its reform proposals accepts this and in particular accepts that any curtailment of Community output must be part of the coherent international effort under which all the major world producers accept comparable commitments.  This is a very important aspect from our point of view. It is of course the Community's very strongly held position that it must get credit in the GATT negotiations for the measures it has taken since the commencement of the negotiations in 1986. Our negotiators will be insisting on this in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    <P>We have to face into the task of securing our interest with determination.  At the same time we must bring our experience and our foresight to bear so that we do not find ourselves engaging merely in a damage limiting exercise.  That attitude of damage limitation is, I think, a highly dangerous one.  We have to set out this task of dealing with these proposals in a way which will ensure not only that we shall not be damaged by them but that, more important, we get out of the new re-fashioned CAP benefits for our agriculture and for our whole economy.  To <Col N="1687" /> a certain extent in the past we were prevented from getting all the benefits of the CAP by in-built safeguards of the system &mdash; I am referring especially to intervention and to its damage to the initiative and drive necessary to develop consumer products.</P>
    <P>The farming organisations have been driven to a state of strong and shocked reaction by these proposals.  I would hope that when they have had some time for quieter reflection they will be able to come forward with ideas and proposals about how the changes might be made in a way which will enable us to get the best possible results from the new regime.  I say new regime because I think that there is general agreement that the CAP as it has been in recent years could not continue as it was and that changes have to be made.  It is up to the Government and in this we will bear our full responsibilities to see to it that the changes are such as will suit Irish conditions to the best possible extent.  I would also like to see some positive thinking from farming organisations on this point.</P>
    <P>The proposals made by the Commission yesterday are, of course, related to the GATT negotiations.  I would not accept for a moment, however, that the changes are being suggested simply in order to enable progress to be made in the GATT.  I in no way wish to minimise the importance of having world trade carried out on as free a basis as possible. Nobody wants a return to protectionism. But in the effort to have freer world trade we have to be careful not to damage the economy of a particular country or group of countries through too rapid change over too short a period.  The GATT connection is relevant but as far as European agriculture is concerned the main motives for change must come from circumstances within Europe.</P>
    <P>One point which I have not mentioned and which I think should never be forgotten when we come to talk about European agriculture is the question of food security.  In modern times people in western countries tend to believe that adequate food will always be available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> The comfort of certainly needs to be backed-up by having in place the means to assure this certainly.  This thought came to me very forcibly when the GATT negotiations were very active in the latter part of 1990.  I was struck on the one hand by the understandable lack of any mention of food security while at the same time, because of the ongoing Gulf crisis, there were considerable doubts and fears in peoples' minds about the future of oil supplies.  I think food security is something which should not be forgotten and then it would be very foolish indeed for Europe to put itself in a position of any risk under that heading.</P>
    <P>During this debate we should also reflect on other matters that have come to the fore in agriculture over the past 12 months.  I am thinking particularly of the various measures introduced in regard to the development of the rural economy. The coming forward of these measures was in itself also a foreshadowing of the likelihood of change in the CAP as we have known it.  The Operational Programme for Rural Development, the Leader Programme and related programmes can have a great importance in the future development of our rural areas.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that we will continue to need a sound Common Agricultural Policy but these other measures have an importance too.  I think for instance of the benefits which in recent years have been brought about in many rural areas through the growth of the mushroom industry.  We can define mushroom production as a form of alternative farm enterprise which is making a great contribution to the livelihood of many small farmers throughout the country.  Indeed also our export trade has benefited very substantially from that particular industry where the best part of 80 per cent of total production is being exported at present.</P>
    <P>I mention this because of my own particular responsibilities in regard to horticulture. Under the same heading I have been very heartened by the great response we have had to the two schemes for potatoes and horticulture under the <Col N="1689" /> Operational Programme for Rural Development.  I am glad to tell the House that we have had in excess of 500 applications in total under both headings and we see the availability of grant-aid under these headings providing the stimulus for much needed investment particularly in the potato sector.  We have lamented on many occasions in this House the fact that we have an unacceptable level of imports coming into our shores.</P>

Because of our foresight in ensuring that this area of agricultural enterprise is included in the Operational Programme for Rural Development we have got the desired response from potato growers and commercial horticulturalists generally. It underlines the fact that the schemes which have been brought in to complement what was there previously are worth while and that we have got the focus right in regard to them.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister of State for giving me some of his time to make a contribution to this very important debate.  Agriculture is of central and vital importance to our economy. The Commission's proposals, <Col N="1690" /> announced last night, have major implications, not just for farmers but for every sector.  It is essential that these proposals will not undermine the effectiveness of the Common Agricultural Policy or jeopardise the expansion and development of our agri-food industry.  Most commentators accept that adjustments of some sort were inevitable.  However, these adjustments and changes must be balanced by other factors.  I am thinking about the fact that Ireland is heavily dependent on agriculture and is on the periphery of the Community.  Therefore, any adjustments or changes must involve fully funded compensation.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is our most vital national interest.  As we move towards greater economic integration this is all the more reason to ensure that such a national interest is completely and fully protected. This concern was central to the approach taken by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, when this matter was considered by the February Council meeting.  Although the matter was essentially a discussion document, it called for the most radical overhaul of the CAP mechanisms since the policy was introduced in 1962.  As the Minister indicated, he reiterated Ireland's commitment to maintaining the CAP and a vibrant, effective and competitive agri-business sector.  Moreover, he made it clear that the CAP's primary objectives, as laid down in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome, are as valid today as when they were originally introduced.  This means that any reforms of the CAP must continue to respect these principles in an effective way.  Therefore, the Commission must provide fully funded real compensation for regions, resources and producers who are adversely affected by reductions in price supports.  They must also recognise Ireland's unique dependence on agriculture, in particular on livestock, milk and cereals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the proposals in these pages announced last night are taken in isolation they will have a serious effect on agriculture, rural life and development. Farm incomes have already been affected by recent developments and we cannot <Col N="1691" /> accept a system of cuts which will jeopardise the fabric of rural life and undermine the enhanced role which agriculture has played in the national recovery &mdash; in other words, there are social and economic aspects to this question.  In so far as the economic emphasis is concerned, the vital importance of agriculture is underlined by the fact that the sector contributes over one quarter of all exports from this country.  The importance of the agri-food sector to our economy is unquestionable; the agri-food business is the single most important element in our external trade and accounts for almost one-third of our total manufacturing output.  Moreover, these products are world renowned for their quality and excellence.  Individual producers and co-operatives have played their part in economic development and indeed they were encouraged to do so.  I know many farmers who borrowed substantially based on milk prices in 1989.  If these proposals are accepted, our farmers will be in serious difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to thank the Minister for allowing me time to speak on this important debate.  It obviously requires more than five minutes, but I will be as succinct as I can.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Opposition speakers in this debate seek to cloud the issue, which is a misunderstanding of the roles of the people concerned.  Commissioner MacSharry has his brief and he must do his job.  It serves no purpose to confuse that with the role of the Irish Government, it is simply predictable playacting; but it is unfortunate, given the seriousness of the position.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach outlined the Government position, which is to safeguard the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy in relation to this country.  That would be proceeded with by a Government of any political hue and I do not think that anybody should indulge in playacting in this regard because it does not serve the farmers or the people in the agri-food business one whit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> Of course, all is not well with the Common Agricultural Policy.  Its subsidy mechanisms have not done anything to lend increased viability to Irish farmers. Despite the benefit of the Common Agricultural Policy, there is continuing emigration on the basis that agriculture is not viable.  Our family farm structure is different from those in other countries and we should use that as a lever in terms of getting the sort of policy responses we require in the reform programme initiated by the MacSharry proposals announced yesterday.  All is not well with the Common Agricultural Policy because the budget is out of control.  Despite increased spending on the Common Agricultural Policy last year, the benefits are going to the multi-nationals involved in the storage business and to the meat factories; they are not going to the producer. The subsidies cause a distortion in the market and are not providing the sort of incomes necessary to maintain a viable livelihood from agriculture.</P>
    <P>An example of that is the fact that Bord Bainne in their report this year said that in spite of the fact they are a dairy produce marketing organisation they did not bother to market dairy products this year because the intervention price was better than the trade price.  This is a marketing organisation becoming involved in the intervention business and using it as a policy as distinct from an insurance scheme, which is what it originally set out to be.</P>
    <P>Common Agricultural Policy reform involves a transitional period.  At some stage we must get back to a market led agriculture which will be to the benefit of Irish producers on the basis of our environmental pluses <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors in Europe.  We have a green image and a grassland based agriculture which will provide the sort of quality produce required in the European market.  The problem &mdash; and the whole debate &mdash; is about price and markets. The Common Agricultural Policy has been built on over a number of years and, despite the premia, headage payments and so on, there is not a margin for Irish farmers to survive.  If we increase our <Col N="1693" /> spending on the Common Agricultural Policy we must ensure that it goes back to the producers and not to those people involved in the agri-business, who have nothing to do with the market at all.  That is the crux of the problem.</P>

      <P>I am concluding.  It is clear that Ireland is best at producing in the primary areas of beef and sheepmeat, dairying and tillage, and we must ensure that these areas are included in any reform programme.</P>
      <P>Finally, one has to recognise again the importance of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  That will be the target point at which people will obtain compensation, whether as indirect subsidisation as occurs at present under the premium headage payments scheme or by direct compensation as proposed in the reform programme.  We look forward to the Appeals Tribunal being in a position to enlarge the areas concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1987 the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government have treated the House with contempt in relation to agriculture.  Since Minister O'Kennedy took up his portfolio the House has had not one debate nor any statement given by him following negotiations in Brussels.  For the first time a Minister for Agriculture and Food was afraid to come into the House and give <Col N="1694" /> an account of his stewardship of that portfolio while he was away representing all Members of the House and the general public.  This is the first real debate on agriculture since 1987.  It is the first time in four years that the Government have given time to debate this subject.</P>
    <P>A very serious problem has arisen but it was not until 28 June, the day before the local elections, that the Taoiseach said there would be a debate.  On 25 occasions since December last he refused to realise how serious the problems would be if the proposals in the leaked documents were true &mdash; and they are true &mdash; and were agreed to in Strasbourg or Brussels.  On a number of occasions the Taoiseach said that the proposals were only leaked proposals, but leaked proposals and leaked documents have often found themselves to be the reality, and that again happened on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Government have been unfair to the people they represent by not saying six months ago that Ireland would not accept such proposals because to do so would decimate thousands of farmers and thousands of jobs in related industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made several speeches about the crock of gold for the agri-tourism industry.  I wish to make just two points in that regard.  Many of the Teagasc advisors have told me that because of the restrictions outlined in the proposals many people making application will not be able to benefit by reason of not being able to put up the amount of money required for the investment. To me that shows the scheme to be a non-starter. Unless certain changes are made immediately, many people will not be able to invest in agri-tourism and will not be able to contribute to the country's overall economy.  I wish to point that out to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This morning the Minister said that the Government were not necessarily opposed to the Commission's proposals. If that is the case, the Taoiseach should take steps to ensure that someone is sent to Brussels who is opposed to the Commission's proposals.  How many cereal farmers will be left in business if these proposals go through?  How many small <Col N="1695" /> milk producers will be left if the proposals go through, taking into account the 25 pence a gallon reduction since last year? We are talking about many more than 40,000 jobs &mdash; God only knows where it will end.</P>
    <P>I do believe that the Taoiseach should have waged stern opposition to these proposals during the recent Summit when he had the opportunity to do so.  The Taoiseach was asked in the House no later than this morning by myself whether he was prepared to meet all Heads of Government of member states, as did Dr. FitzGerald back in 1984.  The Taoiseach declined to give an answer; he declined to say that he would do so.  I now ask the Taoiseach to tell the Irish farming community and the country in general that he is prepared to take on that task and that his Minister for Agriculture is prepared to use the veto against some of these draconian measures.  All of us would like to know whether that will happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the many applications he has received for grants for development projects such as potato stores.  I have one message for the Minister of State: I do hope that he sends all the applications to Brussels, unlike the action he took last year.  I could provide him with the information if he wants to know exactly what happened and who was chosen and who was not chosen. Certainly he should not come into the House to boast about what he has done. What he did last year was a disgrace.  If it happens again, the Opposition will take him to task in the House.</P>
    <P>I now wish to give the rest of my time to Deputy Bill Cotter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a historic day for Ireland.  An Irish Commissioner in Europe told us last night that he has decided to close down rural Ireland.  That is the stark basic message that came through to us last night.  The Commissioner's message to Irish farmers is very simple &mdash; lock up your land and leave.  That message has been received and has been interpreted as such by the <Col N="1696" /> farmers of Monaghan, Cavan and every other county in Ireland, particularly by the farmers from Monaghan.  Monaghan is a county of very small farmers, very vulnerable farmers, who have worked extremely hard through the good times in order to build up viable holdings and viable units.   The Commissioner has now decided, with the co-operation of his friends at home it seems, to lock up that county and walk away from it.</P>
      <P>The news is stark, bad and disgraceful. It is very noticeable today that the farmers are not in a state of shock.  They should be in a state of shock but they are not.  They are not shocked because the old tactic was used; the old tactic of releasing bits and pieces of information over a period has prepared us for the bad news so that when it did arrive, in the exact form that we thought it would, we were not shocked by it &mdash; we knew it would come and we accepted it.  It is a pity that it had to happen in that way. The farming community should really be up in arms today.  Farmers should be blocking the streets and the roads in the way that I saw them do in 1968 and afterwards.</P>

The Deputy should be a very worried man indeed.  In particular he should be very worried at the prospect of an election within the next two years. I have no doubt that at some time Irish farmers will realise what their votes are worth, they will use them in the proper manner and they will give the message that they will not have their wellingtons filled with milk; they will not have their noses rubbed in the potholes.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has not been in the House very much today.  He is hiding somewhere and sending in junior Ministers and others who are doing a very bad job of defending the situation.  How could they defend it?  They have joined the opposition.  We all know that the Government have been colluding with Commissioner MacSharry.  The telephone calls have been coming in.  They knew long before any of us did what the package held.  They knew before the leaks what would be in the package.  We have been informed that they will defend us in Europe but there is not a single farmer in this country who believes his position will be defended in Europe.  I will leave it at that.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following Estimates which were moved by the Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) on Friday, 5 July 1991.  Votes 1 to 3, inclusive, 5 to 44, inclusive; and Supplementary Estimates, Votes 2 and 39.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I dealt specifically with an area that concerns all of us, the area of mental handicap.  The human hardship involved in mental handicap and physical disability will get a good deal worse unless planning starts now.  This planning must take place in the knowledge that resources will become available. I am asking the Minister for Health, <Col N="1698" /> Deputy O'Hanlon, whom I complimented last night in his absence, to fight at Cabinet for these resources.  It is imperative that the Minister for Finance and the Government should, instead of considering further cutbacks, commit themselves now for a period of years to improving the funding available in the area of mental handicap.  The amounts recommended by the review group would go some way towards alleviating the stress and anxiety of thousands of families.</P>
      <P>In South Tipperary we have a very active association for mentally handicapped children funded by voluntary organisations and public charities, social employment schemes, FÁS schemes and so on.  In the last number of days they have issued documentation to all Members of the Oireachtas in South Tipperary. Putting their case in context, they said:</P>
      <P>In the absence of a multi-disciplinary early intervention service as recommended in the Review Group Report, parents of infants with delayed development in South Tipperary are left to fend almost entirely for themselves with the voluntary assistance of members of the Association and other helpers.</P>
      <P>In the absence of supported pre-school services for children with delayed development, parents are left to cope alone and children are losing crucial opportunity for the development that will not come again.</P>
      <P>The single development centre for children in the country is dependent on temporary appointments from FÁS Schemes and on volunteers from the County Association who have to beg on the roads and streets of Tipperary to support the Head of the Centre in her heroic struggles to keep up standards and to meet the needs of two-year-olds and young adults in the same premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are aware that this is not the case in other counties.  Why can fully staffed early intervention teams be available <Col N="1699" /> in County Galway and not in South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Is it that the Minister is complacent and depending on voluntary organisations to do the work of his Department?  The association continued:</P>
    <P>Why can pre-school locations be available in Dublin, Cork and Kerry and not in South Tipperary?</P>
    <P>The Tipperary Association wishes to draw the attention of the people of South Tipperary to the situation of two schools at Cashel which are providing for a large number of pupils with a multiplicity of other handicaps in addition to their mental handicap.</P>
    <P>In many other counties, such schools have access to a support service team which has a multiplicity of professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, speech therapists, physiotherapists and so forth.  Why is it then that these facilities in South Tipperary have to attempt to cope with only token support.</P>
    <P>There is almost a total absence of educational opportunity for children of school going age with a severe or profound degree of mental handicap and when they are accepted in schools or in the developmental centre no additional provision is made by statutory authorities to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>In South Tipperary, there are no places, either day or residential, for adolescents and young adults with a severe or profound degree of mental handicap with the exception of the inappropriate placement of a few adolescents in the development centre at Cashel.</P>
    <P>In the whole of South Tipperary, there is virtually no crisis or respite accommodation for either children or adults of any degree of mental handicap.</P>
    <P>In the whole of South Tipperary, there are not more than twenty residential places for adults with a mental handicap outside of the psychiatric <Col N="1700" /> hospital and there are no services whatsoever for elderly mentally handicapped persons except within the psychiatric hospital.</P>
    <P>In South Tipperary there is not a single day or residential facility for adult mentally handicapped persons with seriously challenging behaviour outside of the psychiatric hospital.</P>
    <P>In South Tipperary, there is not a single day place for an adult person with a severe to profound degree of mental handicap.</P>
    <P>In South Tipperary, there are not more than half a dozen residential places for adults with a severe or profound degree of mental handicap outside of the psychiatric hospital.</P>
    <P>We are fully aware that South Tipperary is being grossly neglected and unfairly treated and we call on politicians of all parties to address the issue as a matter of extreme urgency.  We also demand that the Department of Health, the South-Eastern Health Board and the Service Providers in South Tipperary treat this as a matter of grave crisis and set about the implementation of a concrete plan to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>That is just an example of one county's efforts to deal with a major problem. Something like 2,000 places are required in this area and the funding from the Minister in the last year and in this year has provided only about 150.  That certainly does not attempt to address the real problems in the area of funding for the mentally handicapped.  The Minister has often repeated his personal commitment and that of his Department in the House, and we have accepted that commitment but we find, in the middle of this year, that there are problems in the area of funding in all Departments and that the Minister for Finance and his colleagues are expecting further cutbacks in health because that Department happen to be big spenders, and because they are big spenders they are the first to suffer when there is talk of cutbacks.</P>
    <P>The Minister should stand up and fight his case in the Department of Health and <Col N="1701" /> at Cabinet to ensure that there will be no further peeling back of funding for services, and he will have the total support of the Labour Party in this House. We now want to make sure that the trimmed down and cut back services since 1987 will not suffer further and that the Government's priority will be to ensure that the health services, which are in serious crisis in some areas, will not be further curtailed for lack of finance.  We do not want what is now only an apology for a service to be further run down.  A move by other Departments to encroach on the minimal budget for this year of the Department of Health would have political and other consequences.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is here.  I hope he will respond positively and reassure us that he will stand up and fight for his Department, which has an impact on all the problems of the country.  The Minister should consider health services to be a basic human right and should act accordingly and the Cabinet would have to accede to his requests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to reassure Deputy Ferris that we will continue to develop our health services.  Deputy Ferris expressed concern in relation to the area of mental handicap.  Since I came to office we increased by 40 per cent the allocation to organisations catering for mental handicap. That is a substantial increase, well ahead of inflation, and it allowed for substantial development in services in that area.  In 1987 and in 1988 there were some savings in various areas of the health services, but savings were not made in the area of mental handicap services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ferris referred to the need for planning and I agree that we should have planning.  For that reason I re-established the co-ordinating committees in the health boards, with representatives from the area health boards, the voluntary organisations who deliver some of the services and from the Department, to plan for local needs.  With regard to south Tipperary, to which Deputy Ferris referred, it is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board to plan their services <Col N="1702" /> to suit their area.  Even if I could, it would not be appropriate for me to dictate their priorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantial funding has been provided and not just the 40 per cent increase in the ordinary allocation to the agencies catering for mental handicap. A sum of £2 million was provided in the budget in 1990 which provided 179 new residential places, 442 day places and respite care for 200 persons with mental handicap.  Not alone was that £2 million repeated this year but a further £2 million was provided to allow further development in the services, particularly in Cheeverstown House and in Áras Attracta in Swinford.</P>
      <P>With regard to planning, not alone did we re-establish the co-ordinating committees in the health boards but we produced the report of the working party <i>Needs and Abilities.</i> That outlines the needs, and within the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we will provide the new services necessary.  We all accept that it is necessary to develop services for people with mental handicap.</P>
      <P>With regard to cutbacks, it is time we stopped talking about cutbacks in the health services in this House and faced reality.  Over the last two years there has been in increase of 3,000 people working in the health services.  There are now just 60,000 people working in the health services.  That is an indication of the development that is taking place.  There are also 1,000 more hospital beds open now than there were two years ago. There has been quite substantial development in the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to waiting lists, I inquired today with regard to Cappagh Hospital and I was told that there are 11 consultants in Cappagh Hospital and nine of them have waiting lists of less than four months for hip replacements at the moment.  I asked if we had sufficient facilities to eradicate waiting lists.  I am told that that is possible in regard to hip replacements, but I hasten to add that <Col N="1703" /> when we have all the hips replaced and repaired we then, as one hospital did last year using the increased allocation which they got, get into knee joint replacements and elbow replacements.  It is very encouraging that we are up with the very best and most modern technology in the world and that we are moving into other new joint replacement operations.</P>
    <P>However, my main purpose in the House this evening is to discuss the Estimate for my Department.  The gross non-capital provision in the Estimate amounts to £1,510.366 million.  Allowing for appropriations-in-aid at £194.053 million, the net non-capital grant provision is £1,316.313 million, of which £11.8 million is national lottery funded. The net non-capital provision represents over one-fifth of total Government expenditure on supply services and represents an increase of £40.247 million over the corresponding out-turn figure for 1990.</P>
    <P>Health cash allowances have again been increased at a rate significantly in excess of inflation.  The rate of disabled person's maintenance allowance has, for example, been increased by almost 6 per cent.  The Estimate also provides for the cost of certain special pay awards which fall to be paid in 1991.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the subhead provisions in the Estimate, the level of non-capital expenditure approvable amounts to £1,511.100 million, of which £1,045.527 million is in respect of pay, £377.684 million is in respect of non-pay and £87.916 million is in respect of cash allowances.  When account is taken of the income generated directly by health agencies, the total projected expenditure for 1991 amounts to £1,630.500 million, which is a substantial sum of money.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the very valuable contribution the national lottery has made to the development of community health services in recent years. Last year more than £10.5 million lottery money was spent on providing a wide range of services, including services for the elderly, child services and services for <Col N="1704" /> the mentally and physically handicapped. In 1991 the lottery allocation will be £16.89 million, of which more than £5 million is for the hospital building programme and £5 million is to assist with the implementation of the recommendations of the working party report <i>The Care of the Elderly &mdash; The Years Ahead.</i> The balance will be used to assist projects similar to projects in previous years and includes special allocations for the mentally handicapped and for child services.</P>
    <P>From 1990 the procedure for the distribution of national lottery funds was changed.  While the Department continue to retain control of funding for national based projects such as child services and services for the elderly, grants to local voluntary agencies are now a matter for the relevant health boards. The amount allocated to the health boards for this purpose in 1991 is £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>The total capital provision for 1991 is £41.330 million.  Of this, £27.240 million is being provided by the Exchequer, £5.090 million by the lottery, and a further £9 million is being provided from external sources.  Despite the difficult financial situation which has obtained in recent years, considerable progress has been made in improving the physical infrastructure of the health services. Major improvements in the acute hospital sector have been made, particularly at Beaumont, the Mater, St. James's Hospital, Cavan Hospital, the International Missionary Training Hospital, Drogheda, Castlebar and Mullingar. This year, I am making funds available to complete the commissioning of the developments at St. James's Hospital and funding is also being provided to continue work at Sligo, Wexford and Ardkeen.  Provision has also been made in 1991 for construction work on important hospital improvement schemes at the Rotunda, Monaghan and Kilkenny.  Progress continues to be made in the improvement of the capital stock of the psychiatric service, services for the elderly, services for the physically and mentally handicapped and child care services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> Significant capital developments have taken place in recent years, despite limitations on capital funds, and I recognise that much remains to be done.  In relation to capital, I am endeavouring to take a view of what must be done over the next five years or so.  We already have significant contractual commitments which will dominate the next few years.  Beyond that, we must try to ensure that the existing system is maintained at the right level of efficiency, safety and effectiveness. We cannot contemplate embarking on further developments unless we are satisfied that this additional draw on resources will not hinder our ability to maintain existing services at a high level of efficiency.  I am particularly conscious of the demands which must be met in relation to fire precautions, maintenance and the replacement of equipment.</P>
    <P>The programme of information technology of the health services made good progress over the last year.  Increased funding has been provided and over the two years 1990-91.  Almost £9 million in special capital grants is being made available. Every health board, and many of the large hospitals and other health agencies, have received grants in support of a wide range of projects.  The programme is concentrating on the provision of information in support of the management of patient care and of resources.  Modern hardware, software and networking technologies are being installed.  Particular attention is being given to ensuring that the agencies have the capacities to extract full benefit from these developments through involvement of users of the systems in their selection, training, the development of systems expertise locally, and so on.</P>
    <P>Despite the continuing tight budgetary position, some of the most important developments in the health services in recent years have taken place in 1991.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> represents a significant milestone in the development of community based services.  As the House is aware, there was a debate in the eighties about where new moneys coming on stream should be spent in the <Col N="1706" /> health services.  There is now a consensus that new moneys should be spent in the main in the community for the development of community services.  This is not the view just in this country; it is also the view in other countries in the developed world.  I am very pleased that that is recognised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and that a very comprehensive programme spells out in clear detail where developments will take place within the next seven years.</P>
    <P>Subject to the overriding consideration that we continue to live within the fiscal parameters set out in the programme, substantial capital funding will over the seven year period be allocated to services for the elderly, the physically and intellectually disabled, the psychiatricially ill, child care, dental services and health centres. In addition, the Government will significantly increase current expenditure on these services.</P>
    <P>We have already made progress in this regard.  This year's budget included additional funding for specified community-based services.  I emphasise to the House that the Government will not be prepared to allocate these additional resources without ensuring that value-for-money is achieved and that the planned developments in services actually take place.  Indeed, the monitoring arrangements for the programme will ensure that resources are used for the specific purposes for which they were allocated and that their impact will be assessed.</P>
    <P>The recent enactment of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, represents yet further progress in our efforts to simplify and streamline the operation of the health services by establishing just two categories of eligibility.  The Act will ensure a much fairer system of access to public hospitals.  Under the new admission arrangements which are being introduced on a phased basis, all non-emergency patients will be obliged to make an explicit choice between public and private care, including accommodation and consultant treatment.  This will result in improved access to public beds for public patients, since public beds <Col N="1707" /> will no longer be occupied by consultants' private patients.  I believe that, in adopting this approach, we will greatly improve the services available to all persons in public hospitals, whether they choose public or private care.</P>
    <P>This year I have placed a major emphasis on the health service as a whole achieving greater value for money throughout each area of activity.  I am pleased to report that the service has responded very positively to this initiative.  My Department are providing agencies with every support possible in the pursuit of this objective.</P>
    <P>The concept of value for money has now been firmly established within the structures of health boards and major hospitals.  Particular emphasis has been given to the promotion of greater co-operation among health agencies.  I am glad to say that there has been a ready and rewarding response.</P>
    <P>Late last year I received the report of the Hospital Efficiency Review Group who examined in detail the efficiency of seven major hospitals under a wide range of operational headings.  We are currently implementing the main recommendations of that report.</P>
    <P>I have established a top level steering group to work closely with the chief executive officers of the participating hospitals on the implementation of those efficiency recommendations contained in the report which are amenable to immediate action.  Particular attention is currently being focused on savings which can be achieved on the pay side; public utility contracts; materials management, including purchasing, and pathology costs.  I am confident that as the year progresses, this initiative will continue to show very positive returns.  This is being done in the context of an incentive-based policy which provides for the agencies concerned to retain the benefits of the economies generated.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the need to maximise performance the chief executive officers of the health boards, as well as taking the initiative of assigning a senior officer to the development and co-ordination of <Col N="1708" /> value-for-money programmes at board level, have also at national level established a value-for-money co-ordinating committee under the chairmanship of the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>In addition to these measures a number of very important initiatives have been pursued directly by my Department this year.  Examples include the introduction of a computerised price index system on a pilot basis in seven sites to provide monthly comparisons of prices, brands and usage on a range of over 900 products. The system has the added benefit of providing valuable comparisons with the United Kingdom health authorities.  I may say in that context that when I came into office I established a cost containment unit.  We discovered that in some instances the hospitals which were using the largest number of certain items, say, disposable gloves, were paying a higher price than hospitals which were using a lower amount.  By keeping an eye on the prices paid by the various agencies and keeping in touch with the supply officers of the hospitals and agencies we were able to achieve substantial savings through the cost containment unit.  We have developed this further through our value-for-money programme.</P>
    <P>The area of income generation has been reviewed and agencies have been advised to pursue more vigorous collection methods in, for example, the collection of road traffic accident income.  A number of improved income generation schemes are also in the process of being established at present to ensure that agencies maximise the use of all available assets and resources.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being put in place to ensure a more co-ordinated approach to the procurement of equipment.  We are in contact with our colleagues in Northern Ireland concerning the purchase of an expensive piece of equipment, a magnetic resonance machine. They are purchasing a similar piece of equipment and we have adopted a joint <Col N="1709" /> approach in the tendering process to obtain a better price.</P>
    <P>A detailed examination of professional indemnity insurance costs has been undertaken.  Arrangements have been put in place to facilitate increased take up of European Community intervention schemes by health agencies.  Greater co-operation between the Dublin children's and maternity hospitals is being promoted. A series of initiatives have been pursued with our colleagues in Northern Ireland in the non-pay and equipment purchasing areas.  I have referred to one such initiative already.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been growing public awareness of the scandal of child sexual abuse.  The growth in the number of reports of child sexual abuse and the number of cases in which abuse has been confirmed has been most disturbing.  As recently as 1982 there were only 37 confirmed cases of child sexual abuse known to the health boards.  In 1989 the total number of confirmed cases of all sorts of child abuse known to the health boards was about 1,300, of which the number of confirmed cases of sexual abuse, was about 500.  These figures represent a four-fold increase in five years.  The Department have not yet completed the collection from health boards of statistics in respect of 1990, but on the basis of the returns that have been made to date all the indications are that the total number of cases in 1990, including child sexual abuse, will show a further increase.  In response to this appalling development. I have approved the establishment of specialised units for the investigation, management and treatment of children suspected or being victims of child sexual abuse.  These units are at Temple Street and Crumlin Children's Hospitals and are composed of multi-disciplinary teams, including a paediatrician, psychologists and social workers, with psychiatric support where necessary.  Outside of Dublin, services for the investigation and treatment of the victims of child sexaul abuse have been set up by each of the health boards.</P>
    <P>The growth in child sexual abuse clearly illustrates the need for effective <Col N="1710" /> legislation to protect children who are at risk.  This is the major objective of the Child Care Bill.  The Bill has recently completed its passage through the Dáil and Seanad.  The purpose of the Bill is to update the law in relation to the care of children, particularly children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused or who are at risk.  The Bill aims to achieve these objectives through the strengthening of the powers of the health boards to provide child care and family support services; to allow immediate intervention by health boards and Garda where children are in serious danger; and other measures designed to promote and preserve the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the Bill will necessitate major expansion and new investment in our child care services.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government have given a commitment to making the necessary resources available to enable the Bill to be fully implemented over the seven years of the programme.  Already a good start is being made this year in preparing to implement the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In developing our service, special regard will be had to the most vulnerable groups &mdash; to children who are unloved and unwanted, to children whose parents are unable to care for them, to the plight of young Traveller children living in Third World conditions and to the tragedy of the homeless children.  The plight of young homeless people and the dangers which they face is an issue which the Government take very seriously.  As the House is aware, the Taoiseach recently gave the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Flood, special responsibility for the co-ordination of child centred services.  One of his first tasks is to expedite a number of projects which will provide additional accommodation for homeless young people.  A number of initiatives in this area have recently begun to come on stream in Ballymun and Tallaght and negotiations concerning a number of other projects are at an advanced stage.  I have asked the parties concerned to make every effort <Col N="1711" /> to expedite this process and would hope that most of the additional places would become available during the summer.  A number of other longer term projects are also planned, some of which should come on stream towards the end of the year.  I will be keeping the situation under close review and can assure the House that the Government are committed to doing all that they can to bring an end to the plight of young people sleeping rough on our streets.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the legislation dealing with the recognition of foreign adoptions has been enacted as the Adoption Act, 1991.  This legislation sets out new statutory procedures for the recognition in the State of adoptions effected abroad. While the legislation was framed primarily with the Romanian adoptions in mind, the provisions will apply to adoptions granted in countries throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Given the scale on which Irish people are travelling abroad to adopt children, it is clearly desirable that the law here should be clear and explicit with regard to the circumstances in which such adoptions are entitled to recognition.  It is equally important in the interests of the children concerned that there should be proper procedures to regulate the adoption of foreign children by Irish residents. Children involved in inter-country adoptions are particularly vulnerable and those countries where the adopting parents reside have a special responsibility to protect the welfare of the children by ensuring the suitability of the proposed adopters is properly assessed beforehand.  I believe that the new legislation achieves these objectives and that it provides a secure legal framework for the adoption of foreign children by Irish residents.</P>
    <P>The problem of drug abuse is one which is a matter of deep concern to all of us.  I am determined that every effort should be made to ensure that this problem is controlled in as effective a manner as possible.  Past responses to drug misuse problems have tended to concentrate on <Col N="1712" /> supply reduction through a range of legislation provisions and stricter enforcement measures.  While these efforts have to a large extent been successful in limiting supply and frustrating the efforts of organised suppliers of illicit drugs, they can only be fully effective if operated in tandem with comprehensive demand reduction policies based on education, treatment and occupational rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>When I reconstituted the National Co-Ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse in May last year I asked them, as a matter of urgency, to develop a set of recommendations which would form the basis of a national strategy to prevent drug misuse, covering all aspects of the problem and in particular demand reduction. The recommendations of the committee formed the basis for the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse.  The strategy recognises that there are no easy or instant solutions available to us in our struggle against drug misuse, and recognises existing deficiences.  It sets out realistic and achievable targets in relation to data collection, demand and supply reduction, including education and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes, underpinned by a co-ordinated structure, at both national and regional levels, geared towards their effective implementation. It involves much greater emphasis on community-based services and introduces, for the first time in Ireland, the concept of community drug teams, drawing on the expertise of general practitioners and other health and social services professionals working in the targeted communities with serious drug misuse problems, in addition to proposals on strengthening the legal provisions available in the area of supply reduction.</P>
    <P>The health status of this country leaves much to be desired.  The folowing examples provide graphic illustration of this point: 12,000 deaths annually are as a result of coronary heart disease or stroke. Many of these deaths are premature and preventable.  The number of deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke for males in the age bracket 30-69 is 336 per <Col N="1713" /> 100,000 &mdash; the corresponding figure for Italy, Spain, Belgium and France is under 150; 63 per cent of adult male and 48 per cent of the adult female population are overweight and 5,000 deaths annually are attributable to smoking.</P>
    <P>The Irish lifestyle is implicated in many of the poor status indicators to which I have just referred.  A major focus of health promotion policy is the development of pilot health promotion projects which form part of a national plan for health promotion intended to ensure that the Irish population has a quality and quantity of life on a par with the best health status in Europe.</P>
    <P>Significant funds have been invested in the development of the lifewise programme. This programme is a health education programme for adults aimed at promoting healthy behaviour and providing individuals with the skills, information and motivation to develop a healthy lifestyle.  The programme has been piloted in the Mid-Western Health Board area, and because of its success to date, a number of other boards, along with the Irish Countrywomen's Association, have asked to be party to the programme. A national structure to oversee the development of the lifewise programme and to ensure its quality is being developed.</P>
    <P>Alcohol abuse, particularly among young people, continues to be a major source of concern.  The recent report of the psychiatric hospital services indicates that 25 per cent of admissions are due to the abuse of alcohol.  Unfortunately many of the people admitted to hospital because of the abuse of alcohol are young people.  I was pleased last year to launch a drink awareness programme for young people.  This programme is a joint initiative between my Department and the National Youth Council of Ireland and it aims to provide young people with personal and social skills necessary to make responsible decisions regarding their use of alcohol.  A nationwide training programme for youth leaders and other persons involved with youth is now under way and 350 people have been trained to date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> A number of other initiatives in alcohol education are also being pursued. However, a broader focus is required to tackle the problem of alcohol abuse. Measures necessary to address the problem are multi-factorial and are encompassed within the remit of a number of Government Departments and statutory and voluntary agencies.  In pursuance of a broadly based policy on alcohol, the Government decided that the Advisory Council on Health Promotion should develop a policy which will address broader economic, social, educational, cultural, and health factors which impinge on alcohol use, including the problem of underage drinking.  The council have recently commenced a major consultative exercise in pursuance of the formulation of the policy.  I hope to receive a draft national alcohol policy by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Reducing the number of people who smoke and especially preventing younger people from taking up the habit remains a priority in my Department.  On Shrove Tuesday I launched the 1991 anti-smoking campaign.  The campaign includes a multi-media advertising campaign which highlights the dangerous and disgusting nature of the smoking habit, particularly in relation to young people, a schoolbased information campaign, and a general practitioner-public health nurse pack which will be developed during 1991 to assist such professionals in their practice to adopt a more focused anti-smoking approach.  In addition, I am confident that the Government decision to increase the price of a pack of 20 cigarettes by 10 pence in the January budget will help significantly in reducing the number of people who smoke.</P>
    <P>The recovery plan introduced in January 1989 by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board has been a success and reserves are now moving back towards an appropriate level.  The principal nature in the recovery plan were subscription increases; some reductions and restrictions in benefits and cost containment measures, particularly hospital cash limits.  From 1 March 1991 the VHI introduced their new full cover system under <Col N="1715" /> which, in return for increased fees, participating consultants agree not to charge additional amounts to patients.</P>
    <P>The present position in regard to participation in the scheme by the different consultants is as follows:</P>
    <P>radiologists &mdash; 78 per cent are participating</P>
    <P>physicians &mdash; more than 50 per cent are participating</P>
    <P>pathologists &mdash; 99 per cent are participating</P>
    <P>anaesthetists &mdash; negotiations are not yet concluded</P>
    <P>surgeons &mdash; 15 per cent are participating.</P>
    <P>The VHI expect that the numbers of participating consultants will continue to rise and they will persevere with their efforts to boost participation.</P>
    <P>I am confident that following the positive trends inherent in VHI's affairs in the past 18 months, VHI, with my support, will continue to offer at reasonable cost and on equitable terms, health insurance to all those who wish to avail of it.  Private health insurers in other countries, in contrast, do not offer health insurance cover on equitable terms but rather, operate on a principle of charging older and more vulnerable subscribers higher premia than the young and healthy low risk categories.</P>
    <P>The proposed liberalisation of the insurance market, including health insurance, in the move towards the EC Single Market by January 1993 could have implications for VHI operations.  In view of the serious consequences for Irish health services generally, my Department have made a submission to the EC outlining the particular circumstances of the Irish health services and seeking to maintain community rated health insurance, that is the type of schemes operated by VHI, as the only type of health insurance available on the Irish market.  I am hopeful that we will be successful in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> I made reference last year to the commencement of the first review of this contract for GMS doctors and to the unique opportunity it provided for an assessment of its operation.  The review has been completed, under the chairmanship of Mr. John Horgan, former Chairman of the Labour Court and his report has been considered by both the Irish Medical Organisation and the management side. The report contains a number of recommendations both in relation to the interpretation of specific clauses within the contract and to the operational aspects of others, as they affect the overall effective and efficient operation of the scheme.  I am satisfied that the review recommendations are a fair interpretation of the manner in which the contract was originally intended to operate and, taken as a package, will serve to strengthen the commitment of all those involved in its operation to develop the full potential of general practice.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that a satisfactory arrangement has been agreed on the matter of establishing a tax effective GMS pension plan.  It is expected that the scheme will be in operation very shortly. The resolution of this matter has allowed the Irish Medical Organisation to complete their consideration of the review report.</P>
    <P>I have previously mentioned in the House my concern regarding the need to control costs within the GMS scheme and, in particular, my disappointment with the growth pattern in the volume of prescribing medicines.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure on drugs in 1989 was £107, million, an increase of 15.9 per cent on the previous year.  The total ingredient cost of drugs rose by 18 per cent, of which approximately 6.5 per cent was due to price rises and 11 per cent was due to volume increases and substitution of dearer drugs.  When analysing previous years' figures it was found that a similar rate of volume and substitution increase has been a constant feature of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure on drugs in 1990 was £114 million, approximately an increase of 6.1 per cent on the previous <Col N="1717" /> year.  The total ingredient cost of drugs rose 6.3 per cent over the 1989 figure.  The latest figures available for 1991 indicate a continuance of this upward pattern in prescribing.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the very serious position now reached in relation to prescribing patterns within the GMS scheme, I have recommended to Government that the drug strategy outlined in the GMS review report be implemented without delay.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the strategy involved close co-operation between general practitioners and the health boards. I am confident that this co-operation will be forthcoming from both parties.</P>
    <P>The strategy proposed is designed to produce significant drug savings in 1992. I have already introduced some elements of this strategy including the launch of the National Drugs Formulary and the introduction of a repeat prescription facility to the GMS scheme to help curb this growth in the prescription of drugs.</P>
    <P>The strategy envisages the establishment of a national therapeutic advisory committee, which will give independent authoritive advice in relation to prescribing both in hospitals and the community.  The aim is to encourage the highest standards of treatment through appropriate, safe, efficient and cost-effective prescribing.  Other elements of this strategy which I intend to implement with the co-operation of the Irish Medical Organisation and the profession include: enhanced educational measures on drug use and prescribing focused on the general public and on doctors; greater co-ordinating between hospital and community prescribers; improved analysis of prescribing data; better information flows, including those to general practitioners in relation to their own prescribing patterns and costs; better support structures and greater involvement of health boards in the management of prescribing.</P>
    <P>Another element of the Government's strategy in this area relates to drug prices. In this regard I am glad to report that the agreement between the Government and <Col N="1718" /> the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries completed last August led to a decrease in drug prices of approximately 10 per cent on average in the first year. The significant feature of this agreement is the breaking of the link between Irish and UK pharmaceutical prices.  In future price movements in Ireland will be linked to movements in prices in certain EC countries and this will result in a significantly lower price adjustment in August 1991 than would otherwise have been the case.</P>
    <P>In 1990 a special allocation of £3 million was made available in the budget for the development of dental and orthodontic services.  A similar amount was made available as a special allocation in the 1991 budget.  This additional funding has brought about much needed improvements in the adult dental services provided by the health boards and has also enabled improvements to be effected in the orthodontic services.  About 24,000 adults benefited from the improvement availability of routine dental treatments in 1990, bringing to nearly 42,000 the number of adults who received routine courses of dental treatment during 1990, while a further 34,000 adults received emergency treatments.  The accumulated backlog has been greatly reduced especially for people waiting for dentures.</P>
    <P>Two and half thousand children began their courses of secondary orthodontic care in 1990.  It is estimated that health boards will be able to provide up to 2,000 new starts in orthodontic treatment in 1991.  Priority in orthodontic treatment is being given to children in the most handicapped categories in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department in 1985.  Recently the conditions and salary attached to the post of consultant orthodontist with the health boards have been revised by my Department to make the post much more attractive.  Vacancies in the health boards were recently advertised by the Local Appointments Commission and I am very hopeful that a number of suitable <Col N="1719" /> candidates will come forward.  Appointments to those vacancies will enable further improvements in the orthodontic services to be carried out.  As well as the recruitment of consultants, a number of dentists in health boards are being trained to treat the less serious orthodontic patients under supervision.  This will also help considerably in reducing waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The increased level of funding for dental and orthodontic services provided in 1990 and 1991 has brought about significant improvements in the dental services. Dental care provision for handicapped persons is a priority area. The creation of the new full-time post of consultant in dentistry for handicapped children and young adults &mdash; centred in the Dublin area, but which will provide a national service &mdash; will result in great improvements by making specialist level treatment more widely available and by training other dentists and dental students to treat these special patients.  The newly created grade of dental hygienist will make a significant improvement to the amount of dental care available for eligible children and adults.  I am also engaged in discussions with the Dental Council concerning the creation by the council of a grade of denturist who may legally supply dentures to members of the public.</P>
    <P>Good dental health requires that there be a combination of preventive and treatment programmes available to the community, the mix depending on the amount of dental disease already present. Where effective and efficient preventive programmes are in place there is less reliance on expensive treatment programmes. I might mention here that a number of studies show that across a wide range of parameters there has been a steady improvement in levels of oral health.  Goals set in 1984 for the year 2000 will have to be revised as a number of these goals have already been exceeded for some age groups.  Nevertheless, much remains to be done.  Careful planning is <Col N="1720" /> required to maximise the resources available. My Department are currently preparing a dental plan which will set goals for oral health for each age group in the population to be achieved over the next decade.</P>
    <P>The fluoridation programme continues to be a cornerstone of our preventive programme.  This programme is carefully monitored at health board and at Department level.  About 65 per cent of the population are served by water supplies which are flouridated.  While there has generally been a significant decrease in the level of dental caries in children, surveys show that this decrease has been most significant in children who had been lifetime residents of fluoridated areas. Some of the plant dates from the setting up of the fluoridation programme over 25 years ago and the need for replacement is constant.  A sum of £200,000 was provided in the 1991 Budget for the provision of new plant and for the replacement, as necessary, of existing plant.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the services for mental handicap and the very substantial improvements that have taken place.  When Deputy Ferris raised the issue I responded to it.  I have referred to the fact that we now have in place a very good programme and I referred to the report of the working party and the provisions in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Our psychiatic services have continued to develop along the lines recommended in the report <i>Planning for the Future.</i> This report recommended a service which was comprehensive, community oriented, sector based and integrated with other health services.  The implementation of the policy outlined in <i>Planning for the Future</i> has involved a fundamental reorganisation of our psychiatric services from the traditional institutional approach to one where the emphasis is placed on treating people to the greatest extent possible in local community settings without the disruptive effects of hospital admission.  It is encouraging that the hospital population has reduced from 30,000 in 1958 to fewer than 8,000 at <Col N="1721" /> present and there has been a very substantial reduction in the last five years of 4,000, from 12,000 down now to 8,000.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report that health boards are continuing to make progress in providing community psychiatric facilities.  Since <i>Planning for the Future</i> was published in 1984 the number of day hospitals and day centre places has tripled and the number of hostel places more than doubled.</P>
    <P>In the past year substantial progress has been made in integrating acute psychiatry with the general hospital system. Acute psychiatric units have been opened at Cavan and Tralee general hospitals and it is intended to open similar units at Naas and Roscommon hospitals later this year.  A new community based psychiatric service is being developed by the Eastern Health Board at the Mater Hospital for north Dublin city and as part of this service it is intended to open a new psychiatric unit in the Mater in 1992. Other significant service developments this year include the development of a community psychiatric service in Roscommon, Kildare and north Tipperary and the improvement of facilities at the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House on 26 February last, the Government are committed to assisting health boards and agencies to continue to maintain bed availability of 12,000 beds in 1991.</P>
    <P>While special earmarked funds were allocated at the end of 1989 to effect improvements in the average waiting times for identified &ldquo;blockspot&rdquo; areas, for example, orthopaedics, children ENT services, open heart surgery, the overall strategy of the Department is to concentrate on getting the maximum return from every pound invested and rigorously seek efficiencies where they can be found.  Only when this has been achieved should the question of additional funding be considered to finance needs and not demands.</P>
    <P>The third report of the Kennedy Group which I have recently received contains a number of very important recommendations regarding in-patient waiting <Col N="1722" /> lists and out-patient services.  It does not accept that it is merely a question of allocating more resources in an undirected manner to either or both of these problems.  Rather it makes a series of detailed recommendations on a lengthy number of steps which should be taken by each hospital before it is in a position to demonstrate that it cannot provide an adequate service with the resources already available to it.</P>
    <P>In relation to waiting lists, the report recommends that initially all waiting lists be validated.  Each hospital should maintain comprehensive, standardised information concerning the numbers and types of patients awaiting admission.  Validation to establish reliable waiting list data should be adopted as a firm policy in each hospital and such policies should ensure that appropriate management and clinical action is taken on foot of such reviews.</P>
    <P>Hospitals should also immediately carry out a bulk postal review of patients who have been on a waiting list for more than an agreed period of time.  On completion of this comprehensive review and validation of current waiting lists, formalised regular arrangements should be made by each hospital for the ongoing review and validation of lists.  This approach is not standard practice in all hospitals at present and until it is, data relating to waiting lists should be treated with great caution.</P>
    <P>The report further recommends better scheduling of activity to reduce waiting times, analyses by hospitals to establish whether their activity levels, having regard to case mix, are broadly comparable with the productivity levels of similar services in other locations, a systematic review of the scope for increasing levels of day surgery for appropriate conditions, development of appropriate information technology and better information to general practitioners with regard to the average waiting times for admission.  While the Kennedy Group's recommendations were based on their analysis of the hospital services in Dublin, they have equal validity for other areas of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" /> The third report of the Kennedy Group also makes a number of important recommendations with regard to the organisation of out-patient services.  It highlights the need for better appointment systems for out-patient clinics, for a policy for dealing with non-attenders, and for reducing the level of unnecessary return attendances.  It makes recommendations on better patient information and it highlights the need to match staff to the particular demands of providing a high quality out-patient service.</P>
    <P>These recommendations do not come from a group representative of any single discipline.  The group which was chaired by David Kennedy was a broadly based group drawn from all the major agencies in Dublin, including representatives of the managements of the hospitals, their consultant staffs and the general practitioners. The Department will be working closely with hospital managements and staff to implement the recommendations made.  Many of these will be applicable in all hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Department remain committed to the delivery of a high quality service to patients.  Following a detailed analysis of the problems which arise in the delivery of care, the report of the Commission on Health Funding in 1989 recommended greater responsiveness to patients' needs, including an appeals system and the specification of maximum waiting periods. A &ldquo;patients' charter&rdquo; specifying a hospital code of conduct covering the information to be given to patients before, during and after treatment is being developed, with a patient feedback mechanism within each hospital with the aim of improving communication and the quality of services within hospitals.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of work has been undertaken on these issues within individual hospitals and it is hoped to progress these matters further, building on the specific range of detailed recommendations made recently by the Kennedy Group.</P>
    <P>This will link in with the measures <Col N="1724" /> announced in the Government's <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to minimise waiting times for patients, to provide comfortable waiting areas with appropriate amenities and to provide patient information leaflets.  The programme also refers to the development of the &ldquo;patients' charter&rdquo;; based upon the following principles: the right of access to services in accordance with need; the right to considerate and respectful care; the right to privacy; the right to information; the right to confidentiality of all medical records; the right to refuse to participate in research projects; the right to respect for religious and philosophical beliefs; and the right to make a complaint.</P>
    <P>In recent months, an extra ten beds were opened in the Mater Hospital so as to bring back heart by-pass activity rates in line with previously agreed target levels.  My Department are examining as a matter of urgency ways and means in which to increase this activity further.</P>
    <P>My Department entered into a formal agreement with Camberwell Health Authority in March 1991 which provides that all patients referred from public hospitals in this country requiring liver transplantation will be operated on at King's College Hospital, London.  Under this agreement, Irish medical staff will be seconded to King's College Hospital to receive appropriate training and experience to enable a liver transplant service to be re-established in Ireland as soon as circumstances allow.  The circumstances are not related to funding but to the fact that it is necessary that a certain number of patients need transplantation &mdash; approximately 50 patients per year &mdash; in order to have a viable transplant programme. As soon as the numbers who need transplantation &mdash; unfortunately the numbers are increasing all the time &mdash; are sufficient, a programme will be re-established in this country.</P>
    <P>A working group representative of the Department, the Southern Health Board and the voluntary hospitals in Cork have been established to draw up a plan for the development of hospital services in Cork city and county for the next decade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> The function of the working group is to seek a consensus on the role of acute hospitals and on the priorities for development.  The terms of reference of the group are as follows: 1. to examine the present organisation of acute hospital services in Cork city and county and assess the existing services; 2. to draw up a plan for the development of acute hospital services to include: a definition of the role of each of the acute hospitals in relation to national, regional and local specialties as appropriate; recommendations for changes in the organisation of services to provide a more efficient and effective service for patients; maximum co-operation and sharing of facilities where appropriate between Cork hospitals; identification of priorities for service development; a management development programme for each hospital and the hospitals collectively.</P>
    <P>The provision for the health services in this year's Estimate reflects this Government's continued commitment to the provision of a first-class service for our people.  Inevitably, while the level of service provided has increased over the past number of years, demand will always outstrip the level of service which we are in a position to provide.  This has been the experience in health services in all parts of the world, and Ireland is no exception. This Government's prudent economic policies have played a vital part in the progress which we have made over the past number of years.  In the current economic climate it is more vital than ever that this prudent approach be maintained. In such circumstances it is unlikely that it will be possible to meet the all but insatiable demands on the health services &mdash; indeed it would be irresponsible to attempt to do so.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there are problems not alone in our own country but also in all developed countries in the world, including Britain, France and the United States.  I want to assure the House that this Government are committed to a continuing policy of achieving maximum return from the public funds invested in the health services and of measured progress <Col N="1726" /> in the development of our health services. There has been very substantial improvement and development in our health services in the last couple of years, and I have already referred to that.

      <P>These Estimates are being discussed at a time when the Government and economists are warning that public expenditure for 1991 is way off course and that collective action is needed and indeed contemplated.  I have no doubt, given the general nature of the debate yesterday, today and over the next few days, during which no specific Minister will reply to charges or questions asked, we will have to wait as usual and rely on the national media to convey to us decisions taken by this Coalition Government behind closed doors during the summer recess.  We will have to rely on the media to tell us exactly where the sledgehammer blows will fall.  No doubt they will fall on the heads of the poor and on low income families because usually that section of society suffer when there are cutbacks.  Clearly, with no political will to broaden the tax base in regard to company or capital taxes the only strategy being adopted by the Coalition Government is to achieve savings by cutbacks in vital services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a scandal that although extra time was squeezed out of the Government to allow the Opposition time to air their views, we will be breaking next Friday for the summer recess not any wiser about Government policies or being able to use this Chamber to challenge the Government on their cutbacks.  It is scandalous that we will be no wiser as to how the £200 million or £300 million overrun on expenditure will be resolved.  With a backdrop of ever increasing numbers of people joining the dole queues and emigrants returning from as far afield as Australia, America, mainland Europe and Britain it is clear that not only has public expenditure lost direction but the Government have lost their way and the will and ability to stop the avalanche in <Col N="1727" /> employment numbers.  For the last four consecutive months more people have been dumped on the dole queues.</P>
    <P>The Government arrogantly declared that job creation was not the role of Government but rather their role was to create the environment conductive to job creation for business.  I suggest the Minister tell the 250,000 people unemployed loud and clear that Fianna Fáil on their road to conservative fiscal rectitude, tailing the Progressive Democrats, do not give a damn about them, that job creation is the role of private enterprise and that the Government can sit back on their presumed laurels, beat themselves on the chest and say how great a job they have done: they have created this wonderful Alice in Wonderland type of environment for business with low labour costs, inflation running at three per cent and companies making huge and record profits. Expatriation of profits is running at approximately £2 billion per annum.  In this Alice in Wonderland environment exports are up and the balance of payments is under control but unemployment rises relentlessly each month.</P>
    <P>I remind the Government, and particularly the Progressive Democrats Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, who has responsibility for the Department most concerned with job creation, that the general public demand an active and participative role by Government in creating jobs by themselves, in joint venture schemes or by creating commercial public enterprises.  The policy of total reliance on private enterprise to provide sufficient jobs has failed. The Government have failed the people. This is a message they will be reminded of at the next general election.</P>
    <P>I wish to concentrate, in the short time available to me, on the Department of Social Welfare and their Estimates.  I wish to speak in general terms about the carer's allowance and the Cotter and McDermott case.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has been targeted by a well-known Trinity College economist.  He feels it has been too generous in its commitments.  The <Col N="1728" /> Workers' Party have long supported the concept of centralised collective bargaining but opposed the PESP primarily because of the absence of any specific commitment to genuine tax reform and because it effectively facilitated the privatisation of a number of commercial semi-State companies.  We felt that public sector workers, and their families should not be asked to forego badly needed pay increases simply because the Government got their sums wrong.</P>
    <P>If the Government renege on their commitments, solemnly entered into, how could workers or trade unions accept the word of any Government of the future?  Public sector workers have, once again, become the focus of attack from a group of highly paid right-wing economists and commentators.  Contrary to widespread public perception many public sector workers are poorly paid and earn well below the average industrial wage.  Any attempt to deprive them of the agreed increases would provoke an angry response and could lead to serious industrial relations problems.  A number of pending special pay awards have been singled out for particular attention. However, the validity of these claims has been accepted by the Government and in many cases workers have already made considerable sacrifices by agreeing to defer implementation dates.  I congratulate the workforce in Aer Lingus who have made tremendous sacrifices by deferring implementation dates and incremental increases in the interests of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Workers in the public and private sectors have, since 1987, shown a considerable degree of moderation in wage claims and demands.  They were assured by the Government that this would contribute to reducing unemployment levels &mdash; that was the basis of their commitment &mdash; but instead the unemployment figures are the highest ever recorded and the public sector workers are once again being asked to make more sacrifices, while other sectors are not being asked to exercise similar restraint.  There is no limit on the fees that may be charged by professionals, profits or dividends <Col N="1729" /> earned.  Senior executives of newly privatised State companies have in some cases trebled their salary levels.  Public sector workers are not the cause of the current budgetary over-run and they should not be asked to carry the can.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party &mdash; and this is on record &mdash; voted against the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> because it was inadequate in its commitment and not, as certain economists are arguing, far too liberal in its commitment. However, we are determined to defend the programme now that it has been agreed and particularly since the Trinity College economist &mdash; who very often is listened to by Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Ministers &mdash; has started his campaign to have it renegotiated. How dare he, or anyone else for that matter, say that this programme is too generous when one considers the economic climate for business in Ireland today and the benefits accruing to business from that climate?  Section IV of the programme under the heading &ldquo;Social Reform&rdquo; states:</P>
    <P>Social welfare expenditure is exceptionally high in the Irish economy because of our high unemployment and our high dependency ratio.</P>
    <P>If a Government ever got their figures wrong this Government did when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, estimated the numbers who would be unemployed and for whom allowances would have to be made in his budget.  The Government estimated 238,000 people would be on the dole. However, the figure now stands at an all time high of 258,000, 20,000 higher than the projected figure.  What standard of living will these unfortunate unemployed workers have?  How long will they have to suffer the indignity of unemployment, the queueing in often squalid conditions at the so-called and misnamed employment exchanges?</P>
    <P>Section IV of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> at least recognised the squalid and often dehumanising <Col N="1730" /> conditions prevailing in many employment exchanges.  It states that &ldquo;the ongoing programme of modernising and improving accomodation and facilities for social welfare clients around the country will be continued with a view to providing an accessible and dignified service with due regard to adequate facilities for transacting private and confidential bussiness&rdquo;. Is that section of the programme to be hampered by cutbacks in the Department of Social Welfare?  Will the modernisation be put on ice?  We do not know because no Minister will answer my questions or those of other Deputies.  Will the minimum conditions, such as the provision of a ladies' toilet in Werburgh Street employment exchange be provided, as the commitment in the programme seems to imply?  Can one imagine in 1991, the Department of Social Welfare forcing women, many of whom are pregnant or have children in tow, to queue in Werburgh Street which does not have ladies' toilet although there is one for men?  So much for the provision of &ldquo;dignified services with due regard to adequate facilities&rdquo;.  So much for the social welfare clients.</P>
    <P>I was refused permission during the passage of the Social Welfare Bill to refer to two women &mdash; Cotter and McDermott &mdash; because of the ridiculous <i>sub judice</i> rule.  I want to address this issue which has immediate relevance for 40,000 Irish-women. What will the Government do about discrimination against women?  It has been going on for so long one must presume that the Government are trying to wish it away.  I assure the Minister and the Government that the women affected &mdash; and their families &mdash; will not allow him to forget that the Government owe them money.</P>
    <P>Why are the Government treating these women so despicably?  Is the Minister trying to force each and every one of those 40,000 women to go down the same road as Mrs. Cotter and Mrs. McDermott? Does he intend to drag them through the High Court, the Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice before he will agree to a settlement?  This case has been running for so long that it <Col N="1731" /> is no harm to remind the House of its history; 22 December 1984 was set as the deadline for the elimination of discrimination on the grounds of sex, either directly or indirectly, by reference in particular to marital or family status in statutory schemes which provide protection against sickness, invalidity, old age, unemployment, accidents at work and occupational diseases.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the deadline for implementing EC Directive 79/7 was 22 December 1984 no action was taken by the Irish authorities until the enactment of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985. Even then the Act was not brought into effect until various dates in 1986.  What should have been law in 1984 was not introduced until various dates in 1986. We had many reservations on the manner of implementation of the Directive to Irish law; we submit that there are many areas where the Directive has not yet been properly implemented.  Our complaints at the time concentrated on the proposed elimination of discrimination in two specific areas: (1) on the duration of payment of unemployment benefit, which is that the maximum duration of entitlement of a married woman to unemployment benefit was 312 days, which is 52 weeks.  The duration of entitlement for men, married or single or for single women, was 390 days, a difference of 13 weeks.</P>
    <P>The second issue was the low rate of payment.  A married woman living with her husband or a woman living apart from her husband but being maintained by him received a lower rate of benefit than a man, married or single, or other women receiving disability benefit, unemployment and disablement benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefit.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1985, was passed on 16 July.  Section 6 of the Act which standardised the duration of payment of unemployment benefit for men and married women by extending the duration of payment in the case of married women living with their husbands from 312 days to 390 days, was activated <Col N="1732" /> only in May 1986 when the Social Welfare Act abolished the reduced rates of disability, disablement, unemployment and injury benefit, invalidity pension and unemployment supplement payable to married women living with their husbands. Furthermore, the effect of the 1985 Act was very limited in that only those married women who had received unemployment benefit within the period of 75 days prior to 16 May 1986 were entitled to benefit under the amended legislation.  Consequently, all those married women, who ceased to receive unemployment benefit between the period from 22 December 1984, the deadline for the implementation of the Directive, and 15 February 1986 were unable to avail of its provisions.</P>
    <P>Similarly, married women who were in receipt of reduced rates of disability benefit, disablement benefit, injury benefit, invalidity pension and unemployment supplement from 23 December 1984 to 15 May 1986 &mdash; or the date of the expiration of entitlement if this occurred prior to 15 May 1985 &mdash; had no remedy or relief in relation to the discrimination they had suffered unless they could rely on the provisions of the Directive as and from 23 December 1984.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is all very complicated but when one demystifies it and looks at the figures, dates and the Directive and what this and previous Governments were supposed to do by a certain date one understands why 40,000 &mdash; mainly married &mdash; women are demanding to be given a fair crack of the whip.  The European Court of Justice held in the McDermott and Cotter judgement, No. 286/85 that Article 4 of the Directive was sufficiently precise and unconditional to be relied upon in national proceedings and applied by a national court.  It followed, therefore, that individuals such as Mrs. McDermott and Mrs. Cotter could directly rely on Article 4 of the Directive in the absence of implementing measures before the Irish courts as and from 23 December 1984, thereby precluding the application of any national provision inconsistent with that article.</P>
    <P>The European Court held that, in the <Col N="1733" /> absence of implementing measures, women have the right to be treated in the same manner and to have the same system applied to them as men in the same situation.  This ruling meant that Mrs. McDermott and Mrs. Cotter were entitled to receive unemployment and pay related benefit for a further period of 78 days and it also meant that they were entitled to receive a higher rate of unemployment benefit from 23 December 1984 until their right to receive the unemployment benefit expired.  That issue was conceded by the Government following the judgment of the Court of the European Communities when the case came before the Irish Supreme Court on 27 July 1989.  The Government, however, did not make that concession in relation to any of the other women's claims.  In fact, the Government failed to notify potential claimants of their rights pursuant to Article 4 once 22 December 1984 had passed.  The Employment Equality Agency was established under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and its function includes the provision of information and advice concerning equal pay and equal treatment in employment and vocational training.  However, it has no function in social welfare matters. There is no equivalent to the Employment Equality Agency in relation to social welfare entitlements.  In addition, there were no administrative procedures set up to enable married women to apply for the full rate of the appropriate payments or for the payment of the unemployment benefit for the full duration applicable to married men in similar circumstances. The Government did everything to frustrate and keep people in ignorance of their entitlements.  Right through to this very day they attempt to continue their ostrich-like, head-in-the-sand approach to those famous cases, which have gone through the whole court procedure from the High Court to the Supreme Court to the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>The State scheme of civil legal aid and advice does not allow for the provision of general information to the public in relation to rights such as these effected by <Col N="1734" /> the directive.  Therefore, the inadequate funding of the State's civil legal aid scheme and the exclusion of tribunal representation from its ambit means that in social welfare matters there is no comprehensive scheme of legal aid.  The rights of married women who are affected by the directive therefore cannot be effectively enforced by recourse to law.</P>
    <P>There goes the sad and sorry history and the torture through the European Court of Justice.  But here we are in Dáil Éireann on 10 July 1991 and here I am making the case that I was not allowed to make when the European Court of Justice found in favour of Mrs. Cotter and Mrs. McDermott.  I was shut up because the case was reputedly <i>sub judice.</i> Every element of the news media was carrying statements and all forums were talking openly about the issue, but here in Dáil Éireann we were gagged.  I am now delighted to be able to take the opportunity to remind the Minister and the Government of the long history of the Cotter and McDermott case.  I also remind them that it is not as yet final.  We have a long way to go before the women of Ireland who are entitled to those payments stop demanding their rights.  It follows from the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the case of Cotter and McDermott that all married women who after 23 December 1984 received a lower rate of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, disablement benefit, invalidity pension or occupational injuries benefit for a shorter period of time than were actually received by similarly situated men have been discriminated against contrary to Article 4 of the directive and as such they are entitled by right and by law to be compensated for such unlawful discrimination.</P>
    <P>At the height of that debate a Government press statement, issued on 3 October 1984, calculated that more than 40,000 women would be affected by the implementation of the directive.  Only a small number of the 40,000 women have attempted to have their rights guaranteed by the institution of proceedings.  It is my contention and my party's contention that the Government should consult its <Col N="1735" /> own records in the matter and should compensate for the discrimination suffered by all married women who received the lower rate of the appropriate payment after 23 December 1984 or who received the unemployment benefit for the reduced period.  The Government should not be allowed to rely on its own inactivity or its failure to establish a comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid to escape its liability in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in this modern age of computers and technology there are sitting in the offices of the Minister for Social Welfare computer printouts that name every individual woman who is involved and who is owed arrears by the Government.  If ever the Minister for Social Welfare has the opportunity to come back to reply to the case, then he will have to quantify what he believes to be the total sum outstanding and he will have to make the proper arrangements for the payment of that money.</P>
    <P>What are the Government going to do now that the European Court of Justice has found in favour of those women? Although the Government arrived at an out of court settlement in the Cotter and McDermott case very recently, it is just not good enough for the Minister for Social Welfare to sit back and do nothing; they must make a financial offer sooner or later.  They cannot get away with trying to face down those women, their rights and their entitlements, which courts both here and in Europe have decided they should have.</P>
    <P>What kind of a farce are Estimates debates to be that there is no ministerial reply to be given to me on this matter, with its direct relationship to public expenditure?  The Minister has absolutely no alternative &mdash; the courts have already decided and he must pay those women.  I look forward to hearing that he is taking the steps to ensure that the entitlements of those women will be met in full in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I wish to move to another issue covered under the Social Welfare Estimate.  Yet again it has a direct bearing on and affects mainly women.  I wish to examine the <Col N="1736" /> issue of the carer's allowance.  The way in which the Government treats women is quite incredible.  When the Minister introduced that allowance into the House in November 1990 everyone applauded it as an allowance that was well and truly overdue.  Unfortunately, it was not until we were given the details of the scheme's workings that its relative worthlessness to the vast bulk of carers became clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister had promised that in the first year 8,000 carers would benefit from the scheme, which would replace the previous prescribed relative's allowance scheme.  We must now examine the position more closely.  We must consider who has in fact benefited.  As and from 5 June 1991, eight months after the introduction of the scheme, the figures show that instead of the promised number of 8,000 beneficiaries only 1,400 carers received the maximum allowance of £45, which is to be increased to £50, and that a further 1,784 carers are in receipt of a reduced payment.  Imagine carers being reduced in their payment from £45 downwards. To say that only 3,154 people out of the 65,000 carers in this country are on some form of benefit clearly shows the scheme to be completely inadequate.  The mean means-testing in action under the scheme deducts for every pound of earnings in excess of £2.  Given the value to the State of the carers doing what would otherwise have to be done by the State at an incredible cost, I would argue that, as the first stage in reform of the carer's allowance, this unacceptable means test should be abolished.</P>
    <P>The narrow range of carers who are eligible must be extended drastically to allow far more carers to benefit from the scheme.  As people will remember, the present allowance is only paid to people who are providing full-time care and attention to social welfare pensioners aged 66 years or over or to recipients of invalidity pensions or blind person's pensions regardless of their age.  Is it any wonder that such small numbers benefit?  When one combines both the miserable means testing and the narrow definition of <Col N="1737" /> carer, we should not be surprised that only 1,400 people are eligible.</P>
    <P>There can be no reason why the scheme is only made available to those carers of people classified as pensioners aged 66 years or over.  Has the Minister forgotten the realities of life in Ireland today?  Does he not know that in Ireland most people over 65 years of age are lucky enough to enjoy good health and are active and independent?  We have a long tradition of caring for our older relatives who, through ill health or misfortune, do not enjoy the same degree of independence as the majority.  Yet we are making the miserable £45, soon to be increased to £50, payable to carers so restricted that they have to be dealing with 66 year old pensioners.  What about the vast number of people younger than 66 who are being cared for?  What about the mentally handicapped and those suffering from a huge range of ailments who are in need of constant care and attention?  What about the sacrifices being made by those who are devoting very often a lifetime of care to these categories?  Yet this carer's allowance restricts eligibility to those with an income of £2 or less and who are caring only for 66 year old persons in need of full time care and attention.</P>
    <P>Many severely disabled or dependent elderly people were cared for by statutory services and institutions when they could not be looked after at home.  The level of care in some of these institutions left much to be desired and therefore they became a last resort, in many cases a resort of desperation.  Now, in the enlightened eighties and nineties, Government policy gives a new direction to services for the elderly, emphasising care within the community.  The elderly person, of course, should be assisted in every way possible, with family and voluntary and statutory supports, to stay in his or her home.  If full-time professional care is needed it should be as local as possible and fulsome in its response.  It should not erode the person's rights or disregard their individuality.  The implementation of this policy in regard to keeping people in the community began in the seventies and has galloped <Col N="1738" /> through the eighties.  Sad to say, though, the necessary services in the community have only crawled forward compared to the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to present ourselves to the public and say what a caring society Fianna Fáil is creating.  How are they going to de-institutionalise people?  How are they going to keep the elderly out of homes?  How are they going to keep them in the community when they provide such meagre, insufficient resources and viciously exploit the people who end up spending many years of their lives caring for elderly people?</P>
    <P>The result of this process is that the carers of our older relatives carry the full brunt of responsibility and yet they are not accorded recognition in practical and necessary ways.  Their needs, working under such strains, are unrecognised and ignored.  There is an urgent need to educate professional staff, including those controlling finance, to the reality of these people's lives.  Research indicates that there are 65,000 elderly people in this country who due to declining health depend on a caring relative for daily help and that approximately 25,000 of these elderly people require a high level of daily help &mdash; in other words, full-time care. Think of those figures.  There are 65,000, 25,000 of whom require full-time care, and remember the figure for those eligible for the carer's allowance at 1,400. To qualify for the full rate of carer's allowance one needs to be living with one's relative and be destitute.  Yet it is Government philosophy and policy that elderly people have a right to remain at home and be cared for by their families, as if care was something that could be plucked out of the air.</P>
    <P>Now we have moved away from poor institutionalised care to the quiet and hidden desperation of home care. Women carers repeatedly say that in many situations, even where the carer is married with a husband and children and brothers and sisters of their own, they are left, 99 per cent of the time, to bear the responsibilities and to do the necessary day-to-day tasks.  Imagine the emotional and psychological loneliness, <Col N="1739" /> the hard around the clock work, the meagreness of the services provided by overstretched staff.  These all reinforce the reality that the carer is fully responsible and alone and forgotten by this Government.</P>
    <P>The family continues to be the strongest and most reliable source of care for the elderly, the handicapped, the disabled, the chronically ill.  In the family women are the main care givers.  The majority of people in need of care continue to be cared for at home rather than in institutions.  Families show a high degree of adaptability to the needs of dependants.  There is in fact an impressive body of evidence which indicates the variety of ways in which family members, mainly women again, seek to maintain independence at home despite having to simultaneously discharge other family duties and work responsibilities.</P>
    <P>There is a huge number of carers in Ireland, mainly women, who look after a relative who is elderly, ill or disabled. Many spend long hours doing the practical work of caring.  Some experience considerable stress and undertake caring at a personal and financial cost to themselves and their families.  Some are elderly themselves and in poor health and often they receive little or no help.  This army of carers is the key to community care, providing an informal infrastructure and network of care.  Their contribution is enormous both socially and economically.  Without them the State would have to bear greatly increased costs in health and social and personal and family support services.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister for Health list a patients' charter.  Now I would ask the Minister to recognise that there is a need for a carers' charter that would provide a clear statement of the rights of carers.  They have, of course, a right to lead full and independent lives and continue to provide care without undue cost to their own way of life.  A community of caring implies that the carer does not find herself or himself caring for a person in isolation.  A central element in a community of caring is the <Col N="1740" /> provision of services, from formal to informal and voluntary services, which will address the different needs of carers and the people for whom they care at each stage in the caring process.</P>
    <P>This Government have a role to play and this role will require a financial commitment but we cannot ignore the rights and the plight of carers and of those being cared for.  Will the Minister for Social Welfare wake up and take note of the case being made by carers?  Will he cooperate with them in making the necessary resources available for them to carry out their caring role in a humane and sympathetic way?  Will the Minister support a carers' charter in which he would recognise that carers have the right to be recognised for the central role they play in community care, that carers have the right to address their needs for personal fulfilment and in relation to their contribution to their families and to the community, that they have the right to practical help in carrying out the task of caring, including domestic help, home adaptions, incontinence services and help with transport?  Will the Minister be prepared to support a carers' charter that would recognise, too, that carers have the right to such support services as for example, public health nurses, day care centres and homehelps to provide medical, personal and domestic care, a carers' charter that would recognise that carers have the right to respite care both for short spells as in day hospitals and for long periods to enable them to have time for themselves, that carers have the right to emotional and moral support, the right to financial support, a recompense which does not preclude carers from taking employment or sharing care with other people, that carers have the right to regular assessment and review of their needs and those of the people for whom they care?  We must recognise, too, that carers have the right to easy access to information and advice, to expect the involvement of all family members and to have counselling made available to them at different stages of the caring process, including bereavement counselling.  The Minister should also acknowledge the <Col N="1741" /> right of carers to skills training and to development of their potential.  Carers seek a charter whereby public authorities and community members would provide a plan for services and support for carers, taking into account the unique demographic developments up to and beyond the year 2000.  Carers are also demanding the right to involvement in all levels of policy planning, and to participate and contribute in the planning of an integrated and co-ordinated service for carers.  Carers want the right to have an infrastructure of care, a supportive network to which they can relate when they need to.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister now agree that however well intentioned the carer's allowance may have been it is grossly inadequate and too narrow in its application and goes nowhere near satisfying the very legitimate and dignified requests for recognition by carers associations?</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have had the opportunity to highlight the demands of carers and the rightful demands of approximately 40,000 married women who have been discriminated against by this Government and to whom there are outstanding payments due.  As this is the Estimates debate, the two demands I placed before the House today have some financial implications.  I would ask the Minister to relay to the Cabinet the very genuine and sincere claims of the 40,000 women who have been discriminated against plus the 65,000 or the 25,000 carers, depending on what way one looks at the figures, who are not being recognised and who are certainly not being financially assisted by this Government seeing that only 1,400 carers are getting the £45 or £50 carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for being so tolerant with me and for assisting me in whatever way he could.  I will listen with great interest to what the Minister for the Environment has to say on behalf of the Government about the carer's allowance and about some of the points I have made.</P>

    <P>The first point to be made, in comparing this year with the record of the past few years, is that we must remember that the latter period saw the most dramatic turnaround ever in this country's economic performance.  Back in 1986, we had zero growth, a balance of payments crisis, a record current budget deficit and a national debt which had almost doubled in four years.  Since then strict control of the public finances, allied to imaginative measures which stimulated economic <Col N="1743" /> growth, has turned around all the critical indicators to reflect the very healthy state of our economy.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1990, public expenditure had fallen to around 42 per cent of GNP as compared with 55 per cent in 1986. The Exchequer borrowing requirement fell from 12.8 per cent in 1986 to 2 per cent in 1990.  Our competitiveness in world markets has improved markedly. We have a stable exchange rate within the EMS and one of the lowest inflation rates in the world &mdash; at slightly more than 3 per cent, it is well below the forecast EC average of 5 per cent for 1991.  We have had sizeable balance of payments surpluses in each of the past four years as compared with a huge deficit in 1986. Overall, as the Taoiseach pointed out to the House yesterday, we have been classified by a reputable journal as the fifth healthiest economy in the world.</P>
    <P>The 1991 budget was designed to build on the achievements of recent years but it had to be framed against a difficult and uncertain international background, with unpredictable prospects for world growth.  We acknowledged that at the time.  No one was left in any doubt that, if economic conditions proved to be less favourable than projected, we would not be found wanting in taking the necessary decisions to keep the public finances on the right track.</P>
    <P>While we have undoubtedly seen slippage from the budget figures, we must keep things in perspective.  Our situation is not unique.  Three of the largest and strongest EC economies, Germany, France and Italy, are finding it necessary to make mid-term corrections in their public finances because of international trading conditions.  Secondly, even if our overrun were to reach £200 million, that would still be much less than one per cent of GNP and we would still reduce the debt/GNP ratio this year below the 1990 level of 111 per cent which, let us not forget, is a massive improvement on the levels of 131 per cent reached in 1987 and 1988.</P>
    <P>A downturn in international trading conditions inevitably impacts on an open <Col N="1744" /> economy such as ours.  Despite this, we are still continuing to grow &mdash; forecasts from independent commentators are in the range of 1¼ to 2¼ per cent growth this year, compared with projected average growth of OECD member states of about 1.1 per cent and average EC growth of 1.4 per cent.  The fact that we are still experiencing above average growth in the face of adverse trading conditions confirms that our economic fundamentals are in order and that we have a basically healthy economy.  This Government are determined to maintain that situation and our management of the public finances will continue to be guided by that objective.</P>
    <P>Turning to my Department's 1991 Estimate, I should remind the House that it amounts to nearly six hundred million pounds, an increase of over £22 million or 4 per cent, on the 1990 expenditure outturn.  This aggregate increase includes some large increases such as road expenditure, up £18 million or 8 per cent; public water supply and sewerage expenditure, up nearly £3 million or 4 per cent, and local authority and social housing programmes, up nearly £30 million or 145 per cent.  These increases are offset, in part, by reduced spending in other areas, mainly on private house improvement grants, where the last major instalment of the cost of this scheme was paid in 1990, bringing the total to roughly £200 million.</P>
    <P>Over 90 per cent of the funds provided in this Estimate will be paid to local authorities as grants and subsidies to enable them to provide essential services and to invest in major capital projects.  Only 3.5 per cent of the gross Estimate is absorbed by the Department's own operating expenses &mdash; salaries, travelling, premises, postal and telephone services and so on &mdash; and roughly one fifth of that will be recouped through fees and other charges. Under the new administrative budget system, operating costs will be reduced still further, in real terms, over the next two years.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the huge sums involved, I was glad that experts from the London Institute of Fiscal Studies were <Col N="1745" /> able to report earlier this year that our system of local authority funding is close to the average in international comparison and that our mix of grants is not out of the mainstream of comparison, given the mix of functions.  In 1991, local authorities will incur expenditure of over £1,300 million pounds, and some 54 per cent of this will be met by State grants.</P>
    <P>It is important that this large amount of scarce financial resources is spent in the most economic and efficient manner. Because of Government action over the past few years, I believe local authorities are now generally achieving better value for money for the expenditure incurred. However, because of the necessity to limit the financial demands on the public, at both the national and local levels, and to continue the drive to restore the public finances to a situation of lasting balance, local authorities will have to intensify their efforts in the future to ensure that they get the maximum benefit for all expenditure.  They will have to consider new ways of providing local services and measures to deal with waste, inefficiency, or out-of-date systems and procedures, where these are still present.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to a fundamental reform of all aspects of our system of local government.  We want to make it more effective, more in tune with the needs of local communities, more relevant and responsive and more cost effective.  The first step in the ongoing programme of reform was the Local Government Act, 1991.  I have made orders under which most provisions of that Act have by now been brought into operation and I intend that the few remaining sections will be brought into operation in the near future.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Act will assist local authorities in making choices, including choices about where to incur expenditure.  So as to add still further to local discretion, I am examining the various existing statutory controls on local authorities to see how many can be removed, leaving local authorities free to make &mdash; and to answer for &mdash; their own decisions.</P>
    <P>The 1991 Act sets out the right of local <Col N="1746" /> authorities to take all necessary action in support of their existing functions and to carry out other functions which can advantageously be performed in conjunction with them.  In addition, it removes the restrictions of the <i>ultra vires</i> rule, for once and for all, leaving local authorities free to take on new challenges. I can say, therefore, that our reform programme is well on course and that the 1991 Local Government Act provides a sound base on which to build.  The reform of local government will not stop there, nor will it be forgotten about as happened so often in the past.  We are proceeding in stages in an ordered and planned manner.  The 1991 Act is a flexible and dynamic instrument and a series of orders and regulations arising from it will bring further changes in the months ahead.  In addition, further elements of the system are under review arising from which additional legislation and other measures will be brought forward.</P>
    <P>On the local finance side, further developments are also in prospect.  Financial reform is, of course, an integral part of the programme for local government reform and I have been taking measures in this respect over the last four years.  In the current year, the Estimate includes nearly £169 million for the rate support grant, an increase of 3 per cent in line with inflation levels.  Local authorities have welcomed this increase which follows a similar increase last year.  The increased grant will enable the authorities to maintain the wide range of essential services they deliver to the public provided, of course, they continue to exercise strict financial management of spending levels in all spheres of activity. The authorities generally are to be complimented for their responsible attitude over the past few years in keeping spending levels within the resources available. I am looking to the new councils to maintain this approach at Estimates time and throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for the Institute of Fiscal Studies to examine options for the distribution of the rate support grant with a view to achieving greater equalisation among local authorities.  The study <Col N="1747" /> should be completed later this year and I look forward with interest to its recommendations. It will, I hope, enable us to find the fairest possible way of sharing out the funds available, taking account of local needs and local resources.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> forecasts that activity in the construction sector in the period up to 1993 will parallel general economic progress.  While the programme expects overall construction output to continue to grow, most commentators expect that this will be at a more moderate rate than previously.  The principal vehicle for growth will continue to be the private sector but the high levels of public investment in the industry will also play a major part.</P>
    <P>Although it is not now subject to the wide variations of earlier years, construction activity continues to be cyclical in its nature.  Due to a number of factors, not least of which were bad building weather at the beginning of the year, the Gulf crisis, interest rate patterns and a certain degree of oversupply, it is likely there will be a levelling off of activity this year. This might be expected when regard is had to the record achievements of the last two years.  The prospects will be dealt with in more detail in my Department's assessment of activity in the industry which I hope to publish shortly.</P>
    <P>In spite of the difficult budgetary position, the Government increased the provisions in the Public Capital Programme affecting the construction industry by over 8 per cent this year compared to the 1990 outturn.  The principal sectors where increases occur are industry, up 6 per cent; tourism, up 55 per cent; energy, up 61 per cent; transport, up 18 per cent, roads and sanitary services, up nearly 6 per cent, and housing, up 15 per cent.  Of course, everybody would have liked to see larger increases in some sectors but I believe that the overall thrust of the Government's strategy is the correct one and augurs well for a continuing and sustainable high level of output in the industry, consistent with the aims of the <Col N="1748" /><i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The main thrust of Government transport policy is set out in the operational programme agreed between the Government and the EC Commission last year. This is a fully integrated programme of investment in roads and other transport infrastructure, prepared by my Department working closely with the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications and the Department of the Marine.  It involves a total investment in roads, rail, ports and airports of £818 million in the five years 1989 to 1993, of which £516 million is being provided in EC grants.  The 1991 Estimates provide £234 million for State road grants.  This is the highest provision ever made by any Government and is £18 million more than the 1990 outturn.</P>
    <P>Twenty-nine major improvement projects are scheduled for completion and 28 more are to start during the period of the operational programme.  At the start of 1991, 17 major road projects were already in progress, with a total estimated cost of £300 million.  A further eight major projects are due to start this year, with a total estimated cost of £193 million.</P>
    <P>To further underline the Government's commitment to the national road network, I recently presented the Roads Bill, 1991, to this House and I hope that it will be enacted in the next session. This is the most comprehensive roads legislation in the history of the State. It is designed to establish the National Roads Authority on a statutory footing, and to update, strengthen and modernise the law on public roads.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the National Roads Authority will have overall responsibility for planning and supervising the construction, improvement and maintenance of the network of national roads, including the access routes to the principal ports and airports.  National roads represent under 6 per cent of total road mileage, but account for about 37 per cent of total road traffic, two-thirds of it work-related. The assignment of overall responsibility <Col N="1749" /> for these roads to a strong and singleminded authority, well equipped to get on with the work of developing the network in partnership with the local authorities, should bring major benefits. Future generations will, I believe, look back on this Bill as a watershed in the improvement of our national roads.</P>
    <P>In 1989, the Government made a commitment that £150 million would be provided over three years in discretionary grants to county councils for maintenance and improvement work on the county and regional roads.  This has been more than fulfilled: in fact, total grants over the three years will amount to over £182 million.  I would add that the provision of £68 million for this purpose in 1991 represents almost a threefold increase on the 1986 provision of £23 million.</P>
    <P>The conditions governing expenditure of these grants were changed at my direction in 1989 to give more discretion to county councils and to allow more funds to be spent on surface restoration.</P>
    <P>Overall expenditure in 1991 on county and regional roads, financed from my Department and local authorities' own resources, will amount to £120 million, roughly £2,400 for every mile of these roads.  I am looking to the local authorities &mdash; the recently elected councillors, as well as their managers and engineers &mdash; to see to it that this huge sum of money is used to best effect bringing measurable and commensurate returns.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the roads area, I would like to refer briefly to driver testing.  The delays and difficulties in this area have had only one source &mdash; a huge drop in the number of testers.  I have now rectified this.  As well as bringing the driver testing corps up to full strength, I have also engaged 19 additional testers on a short term contract basis.  There are now almost twice as many testers as last year and I am confident that the driving test backlog will be eliminated by the end of the year.  The numbers on the waiting list peaked at over 68,000 last November. The total in mid-June, was nearly 20,000 fewer, at 48,600.  Of these, more than 14,000 had been given test appointments for the five weeks ending on 20 July and <Col N="1750" /> another 10,500 had earlier been offered tests but had either cancelled or indicated that they did not want an early test.  The effective waiting list was, therefore, down to 24,000 at mid-June and waiting times at centres around the country are coming down too.</P>
    <P>We are proud of our environment in this country.  Our countryside is largely unspoilt and our lakes and rivers do not suffer from serious levels of pollution; but there is still a need to give more and more attention to environmental protection, to improve our systems and organisation arrangements and to devote significant financial resources to the effort.  Standards are constantly rising and so too are public expectations in this area.</P>
    <P>The past year has seen a number of major developments in environment policy.  On the legislative front, we have had the enactment of improved water pollution legislation, the publication and processing through the Seanad of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and the initiation of work in the Department on a comprehensive new Waste Bill.  At the operational level there has been the historic achievement of successfully eliminating Dublin smog.  At the level of environmental awareness and information we have had the highly acclaimed operation of ENFO, the Environmental Information Service, and a steady output of environmental publications and information from the Department and the Environmental Research Unit.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment, I will continue to strive towards full implementation of the Government's Environment Action Programme, published in January 1990.  This is the blueprint for activity for the rest of this century and we have made a good start in the last 18 months in getting the programme under way.  I hope to publish a report next week showing what progress has been made under the individual headings and what work is being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Environment Action Programme gives particular attention to the quality of drinking water and the disposal of sewage <Col N="1751" /> and other water-borne wastes, bearing in mind the relevant EC quality standards and the heightened awareness of people generally about the need for improvements in these areas.  In particular, the action programme anticipated the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Directive adopted recently by the EC Council of Environment Ministers. Priority coastal locations have already been identified and planning for the implementation of the necessary sewage treatment schemes has commenced.</P>
    <P>The 1991 capital provision for water and sewerage schemes has been increased by 4 per cent to £72.5 million, compared with last year's outturn.  The provision will allow for expansion of the programme and enable the planning of schemes to develop in an orderly manner.</P>
    <P>Under the Operational Programme for Water, Sanitary and Other Local Services, 1989-93, the European Community has agreed to co-finance, on a 50-50 basis, water and sewerage schemes costing £184 million.  The European Community has thus recognised the role of water supply and sewerage infrastructure in fostering economic investment.  EC aid for sanitary services schemes is already available under FEOGA and will also be forthcoming now under the ENVIREG and INTERREG initiatives.</P>
    <P>The most striking environmental achievement on the ground during the past year was the elimination of Dublin smog.  The Government decided early last year that a radical new strategy was required to resolve this previously intractable problem, that strategy needed to be comprehensive and to work quickly.</P>
    <P>The central element in our strategy to eliminate Dublin smog was the ban on the marketing of bituminous coal in the Dublin area.  Other supporting measures were also important: a substantial increase in heating allowances for low income families; an extensive publicity and information campaign; active promotion of gas conversions; and the specification that all new housing in Dublin conforms to smokeless requirements.</P>
    <P>In the seven years prior to 1990-91 air <Col N="1752" /> quality standards for smoke were exceeded on average in Dublin more than ten times a year.  In 1990-91 no breaches of these standards were recorded.  A comparison of monthly smoke levels recorded by the Dublin local authorities indicates that smoke levels between October and February last declined by 54 per cent on average when compared with 1989-90 results for a similar period.  The effective reduction was even more marked during the critical winter months of November and December when the recorded levels decreased by over 70 per cent in comparison to 1989 levels.</P>
    <P>The clear success of the ban reflects in particular the widespread support of the public as well as the co-operation of the trade generally and the enforcement efforts of the local authorities in policing the ban.  Active public support will continue to be an essential ingredient in ensuring that the good air quality achieved this winter is preserved for the future.  The benefits of clean air in Dublin in terms of better health and a better environment for its citizens, together with an improved image for the city, are very real and are clearly valued by the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We are aware that additional costs could arise for households in using the alternative fuels and almost £6 million was provided during the heating season to minimise the additional costs for lowincome households.  About 74,000 households in Dublin qualified for this special allowance which was payable by the Department of Social Welfare.  When added to the normal fuel allowance, in all more than one in four households in Dublin received an allowance of £8 per week in total over a 26 week period to help with fuel costs.</P>
    <P>The continued success of the Dublin coal ban will require the same effort and co-operation from all concerned &mdash; the public, the fuel trade and the Dublin local authorities &mdash; as was evidenced last winter.  I am confident that this will be forthcoming and that the progress already achieved in improving air quality will be maintained in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> The Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment Act, 1990, which came into force last year, has considerably strengthened the powers available to local authorities to prevent and deal with water pollution.  The new Act specifically reinforces the polluter pays principle which is a fundamental plank of Irish pollution control policy.  The Act expressly provides that a convicted polluter be made liable to pay the costs incurred by the prosecuting authority in bringing the prosecution, a provision allowing any person to seek a court order requiring remedial measures to be taken &mdash; for example, to replace fish stocks &mdash; and a statutory provision making polluters civilly liable for the damage caused by the pollution in certain cases.  Similar measures are now being incorporated in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill as regards liability for damage resulting from air pollution legislation.</P>
    <P>Since the very high number of fish kills in the summer of 1987, when 122 fish kills were reported, an ongoing programme, of which the amending legislation was only one aspect, has been in place to eliminate such incidents.  An indication of the success of these measures has been the reduction in the number of kills caused by agricultural pollution since 1987.  In that year 95 of the 122 kills were caused by agriculture.  During the years 1988 to 1990 the incidents attributable to this source ranged from 23 to 26 kills. Figures for 1991 to date indicate that so far this year less than one-third of the kills were the result of farming activities &mdash; six out of a provisional figure of 20. Even more encouraging is the fact that the number of fish kills to the end of June this year is the lowest since 1983.  In addition, the eight fish kills in June, the month which traditionally has had the highest number of kills, is also the lowest figure since 1983.</P>
    <P>A recent report from the European Commission on bathing water quality in the Community shows Ireland at top of the league with full compliance with standards at 96 per cent of our listed beaches.  The number of Irish beaches which have achieved Blue Flag standards <Col N="1754" /> has increased from 48 in 1990 to 66 in 1991.  This corroborates the generally satisfactory situation of Irish beaches and bathing waters.</P>
    <P>Our continuing concern is to ensure that control measures are taken where necessary so that the progress being made in protecting the quality of our waters is maintained.</P>
    <P>The increase in the quantities and types of waste generated in recent years has given rise to many new control and disposal problems.  We need new comprehensive waste legislation to ensure that these problems are regulated in a well ordered manner.  The patchwork of Public Health and Sanitary Services Acts that has survived from the last century is now completely anachronistic and we need a far wider control dimension than is possible under the series of Regulations made under the European Communities Act.  I regard the preparation of a new code of waste legislation as an important priority and work on this is already under way in my Department.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of waste management is the extent to which we can recover waste materials for profitable reuse. We are not as advanced in recycling as some of the mainland European countries, and many elements of consumer waste which are readily recovered for reprocessing in other countries are left to litter our countryside.  Progress is however being made.  Within the last three years the national percentage of recycled glass has risen from 6 per cent to 14 per cent while metal-can recovery levels have moved from zero to 10 per cent in the same period.  The increase in recovery levels for waste paper and plastics, while less spectacular, is also notable.  Growing environmental consciousness has of course played a part in the improving situation.  This could not have happened, however, without a basic recovery infrastructure.  The scheme of recycling grants introduced some years ago has already assisted in the setting up of 20 recycling projects.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency forms a major part of the Government's plans for protecting the environmental <Col N="1755" /> resources of the country.  The Environmental Protection Agency Bill has had an extensive debate in the Seanad and has now passed all Stages there.  We intend to have the Bill before this House early in the next session and hope it will be enacted before Christmas so that the agency can be up and running next year.</P>
    <P>The agency's functions will involve four main areas &mdash; licensing of those activities with potential for major pollution, monitoring of environmental quality, providing advice and assistance to public authorities, and promoting and co-ordinating environmental research and sound environmental practices.</P>
    <P>The agency will supplement and complement the role of local authorities and will ensure that national environmental protection action is coherent and consistent. Local authorities will continue to play a major role in relation to environmental protection.  Good relations between the agency and local authorities, based on mutual trust and co-operation, will be a vital part of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>Along with the wide range of initiatives the Government are taking to protect the environment through the environment action programme, we are also determined to increase the level of environmental awareness among the public generally.  The resources allocated for this purpose in the 1991 Estimates will be used to encourage and support voluntary, community and other committed groups and individuals through award schemes and grants administered by my Department. Special promotional campaigns will also be developed in respect of particular environmental issues which need to be highlighted.  As one example, my Department will be launching a multimedia anti-litter campaign very shortly.</P>
    <P>While the vastly increased availability of environmental information in recent years is very welcome, there are some dangers of information overload and confusion among the general public as to what exactly the problems are and what the role of the individual is in solving them.  Given this situation and the need <Col N="1756" /> for active involvement of the public in the cause of the environment, there was a case for an easily accessible source of wide-ranging and authoritative information on the environment.</P>
    <P>ENFO &mdash; the Environment Information Service, was established in September 1990 and a sum of £600,000 has been allocated for 1991.  The main services provided by ENFO are the operation of a public drop-in information centre and reference library at 17 St. Andrew Street, Dublin, a postal and telephone query service and the production of a series of information leaflets on environmental topics.  As an indication of the popularity of this service, ENFO has averaged well over 1,000 visitors per week since it opened.  ENFO has also a countrywide network for the distribution of leaflets and it is developing access facilities to its computerised information in all major public libraries around the country.  I believe ENFO will make a substantial contribution to the creation of a broader and fuller understanding of environmental issues.</P>
    <P>Since I launched it last February, the plan for social housing has been widely acknowledged as the most comprehensive and imaginative response to social housing needs this country has seen.  The plan greatly increases the choice available to low income families and households in regard to their housing accommodation and improves their prospects of becoming house owners.  The new measures will also ensure that the local authority and voluntary housing sectors can work together to provide a modern and effective social housing system and one which meets the needs of those unable to provide adequate accommodation from their own resources.</P>
    <P>We can all be proud of the fact that we have over 80 per cent home ownership in this country at present.  I am particularly proud of the part I played in extending home ownership to over 30,000 local authority tenants through the 1988 tenant purchase scheme.  But there are still households, especially younger persons, who are not able to realise the ambition of owning their own homes.  Many of the <Col N="1757" /> new measures which I announced are specifically targeted towards this group. I believe that, taken together, the shared ownership system, the mortgage allowance for tenants and the provision of sites by local authorities represent the broadest and most positive initiative ever in this country to assist marginal house purchasers. The public response to these schemes suggests that they will be highly successful and will be of major significance in meeting housing needs in the future.  The Estimates include provisions for the commencement of these schemes this year.</P>
    <P>The range of new measures in the plan complements the local authority housing programme which itself is an integral element in the plan.  The total funds available this year for the programme come to £69 million &mdash; an increase of over 35 per cent on last year's expenditure of £51 million.  Of this sum, nearly £46 million is being devoted to the provision of local authority housing, an increase of about 35 per cent on last year's capital expenditure of £34 million, and over double the expenditure in 1989.  The increased 1991 allocation will enable a significantly expanded programme to be undertaken this year.  This should yield about 1,300 completions and about 1,500 new starts.</P>
    <P>The availability of local authority accommodation is not, of course, solely determined by the number of new units of accommodation provided.  Taking account of casual vacancies, it is estimated that 5,000 new lettings of local authority dwellings will be made this year.</P>
    <P>Under the plan for social housing, I introduced a new scheme, whereby local authorities may repair or extend the existing accommodation of an applicant for housing as an alternative to rehousing by the local authority.  This can be a very cost effective way of meeting housing need and can have the significant social advantage of ensuring that applicants for housing remain in their own neighbourhoods and communities.  I have provided £2 million for this scheme in 1991.</P>
    <P>The voluntary housing sector has been playing an increasingly important role in <Col N="1758" /> meeting social housing needs in recent years.  I anticipate that this sector will provide about 550 additional units of accommodation in 1991.  I would like to acknowledge the excellent work which the voluntary sector has done in meeting the housing needs of some of the least well off in our society.  The sector has the experience, the ability and the willingness to be major providers of social housing in future years and I intend to assist and encourage the organisations involved to the fullest extent possible.  In this respect I am pleased that I was able to increase the capital provision under the voluntary housing scheme to £11.5 million in 1991, an increase of £2 million over the expenditure allowed in 1990.</P>
    <P>In order to further develop the role of the voluntary sector in meeting social housing needs the plan for social housing provides for a new rental subsidy scheme covering family type accommodation.  I am confident that this scheme will provide the opportunity for the voluntary housing movement to become significant players in meeting the full range of modern housing needs.  Under this new scheme a voluntary body may borrow the full capital cost of a project.  The loan charges incurred, together with a contribution towards maintenance and management, will be financed from the rents received, together with a subsidy paid by the local authority and recouped by my Department.  I am delighted with the response from the voluntary housing sector to this new scheme to date and I was particularly pleased to be able to launch the first rental subsidy scheme in Waterford on 30 May of this year.</P>
    <P>The overall provision of £69 million for the local authority housing programme includes £16 million in respect of remedial works this year compared to only £1.6 million in 1986.  To date some £63 million has been made available to local authorities for necessary remedial works to their older and substandard housing under this scheme.  This year's allocation will provide for works to some 75 local authority estates throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased to include in the <Col N="1759" /> plan for social housing a special subprogramme to assist local authorities to provide bathrooms in their housing stock which still lacks this facility.  I have allocated £2 million in 1991 to fund this subprogramme, which is intended to complement local authorities' own efforts to provide these basic facilities.</P>
    <P>Last year I provided £600,000 for recoupment to local authorities in respect of expenditure they incurred in securing accommodation for homeless persons under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988.  There was a substantial saving on this subhead which led me to believe that not all local authorities were fully utilising the powers available to them to improve the housing conditions of homeless persons in their areas.</P>
    <P>During 1990 I initiated a review of the effectiveness of the measures introduced under the 1988 Act in relation to the accommodation of homeless persons. Housing authorities, the voluntary organisations working with the homeless and the Department of Health were consulted in the review, which concluded that the basic legislation and guidelines were satisfactory where they were implemented in a flexible and sympathetic manner by local authorities. There was, however, justified concern regarding the implementation of the guidelines by some local authorities.  I have, therefore, strengthened and revised the guidelines in a number of key areas and simplified the arrangements under which local authorities can give financial assistance to voluntary organisations providing accommodation for homeless persons.  These revised guidelines were issued to local authorities on 3 May last.  I am confident that the effective implementation of those new guidelines will greatly improve access to decent accommodation for homeless persons.  I have again provided £600,000 for recoupment to local authorities in this area in 1991 and I am hopeful that the provision will be fully utilised.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the National Safety Council, which I set up in 1988, have been successful in consolidating the <Col N="1760" /> work of the three bodies which they replaced and are effectively and efficiently carrying out the tasks assigned to them.  I have allocated a further grant of £550,000 to the council for 1991.  I want to express my appreciation to the Irish Insurance Federation for their contribution of £480,000 to the council this year, including a special grant of £250,000 to provide support for a major road safety campaign which I launched last September and which has been singularly successful so far.  The council have a lead role in this campaign and have drawn up a public awareness action plan involving extensive media advertising in areas such as drink/driving and the use of seat belts; promotional work on TV, national and local radio, magazines, videos, leaflets and involvement in conferences.</P>
    <P>Figures for 1990 show that 478 people died in road accidents, an increase of 18 over 1989.  However, there has been a considerable drop in road deaths since the launch of the road safety campaign last September.  Preliminary road accident figures up to the end of May 1991 show a drop from 193 to 153 in the numbers killed compared with the same period in 1990.  While it is still too early to draw any firm conclusions, this reduction is very encouraging indeed. Attitudes towards drink-driving and speeding are hopefully changing for the better and legislation which I hope to bring before the House in the next session will reinforce this.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would like to take this opportunity, as the busy holiday period commences, to ask the public to take extra care on all our roads, in the water or in areas where there is a fire risk. People should abide by the advice that is widely available and in particular from the National Safety Council.  We all want to avoid tragic accidents and I appeal, therefore, to people to exercise great caution. Compliance with a few basic rules would avoid tragedies and make the holiday season more enjoyable for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to debate the Estimates for the Department of the Environment.  The services provided by the Department are necessary for our daily lives, whether it be water supply, sewerage, roads, housing, fire services and many more services.  Most of these services are provided by local authorities in a quiet and efficient manner.  The staff and elected members of the authorities deserve our support and thanks.</P>
      <P>The Government have taken action to implement reforms in the local government area.  It is the first real reform that has taken place for decades.  This reform is being implemented and additional measures will be put in place in the near future.</P>
      <P>I would like to say a few words about the construction industry.  Construction activity began to recover in 1988 and in 1989, and in 1990 the industry enjoyed a period of growth in contrast to its decline in fortunes for much of the earlier part of the last decade.  In the past two years output in the industry increased by about 20 per cent and employment by about 15 per cent.  The period of decline prior to 1988 reflected the poor performance of the economy then, with unsustainable levels of public investment at a time of downturn in private investment.  The improvement in the construction industry followed from Government action to restore confidence in the economy.  The work of the industry can be clearly seen all around the country in major road improvements, more water and sewerage schemes and urban renewal projects. While there will inevitably be a levelling off of activity this year, there should continue to be a growth in output in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with urban renewal.  The Government's drive to promote urban renewal in cities and towns <Col N="1762" /> throughout the country has been particularly successful in recent years.  Contributing to this success has been the Government's economic policy which has created a climate for increased private sector investment.  Along with the new optimism the designated areas scheme for urban renewal, which is being vigorously promoted by the Government, has resulted in a substantial increase in private sector development in parts of our urban areas which had for years lain dormant.  To date private sector projects involving investment of over £600 million have been generated or planned.  They will give rise to over 10,000 construction jobs, as well as a large number of long-term jobs.  All of this investment is in addition to the Custom House Docks project, valued at some £400 million, where work is progressing rapidly.</P>
    <P>In order to upgrade the general environment in designated areas, a new scheme of urban renewal grants was introduced in 1989 to finance works by local authorities which complement and encourage private sector investment in these areas.  Over the last two years a total of £4.5 million has been provided in urban renewal grants.  A further £1 million is being provided this year in the Estimates under discussion.  This has been supplemented by additional contributions from local authorities and the private sector.</P>
    <P>In this year's Finance Act the Government introduced new measures which will improve the urban renewal programme. Firstly, we are improving the tax relief regime for developments carried out under section 23 arrangements as well as extending the time period for section 23 tax relief to 31 May 1993 in the designated areas.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we are making special arrangements to promote development in the Temple Bar area by applying a generous package of tax incentives to promote new and especially refurbishment works in the area.  Urban renewal is a joint effort between the State, local authorities and the private sector.  With the combined efforts of all <Col N="1763" /> concerned, we are succeeding in eradicating the decay and dereliction, which has blighted many of our towns and cities. I am glad that the urban renewal programme has been very successful.  Great thanks and credit must go to all local authorities throughout the country who have been involved in the designated areas and for the manner in which they have promoted the various programmes. We deeply appreciate that.  As Minister with responsibility for urban renewal, I convey my thanks to all local authorities throughout the country for their great efforts in this regard and for their liaison with all interested parties.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Estimates include provisions for the start of the various elements of the social housing programme. These schemes include the shared ownership scheme, mortgage allowance for tenants, provision of bathrooms in local authority houses lacking these facilities, provision of sites by local authorities and increased funding for voluntary housing projects.  These measures are in addition to the normal local authority house building programme.  The programme will be expanded this year.  The overall provision for local authority and social housing is over £80 million compared with about £60 million last year. This is an increase of nearly £20 million or 33 per cent.  This is a large increase, especially at a time of scarce financial resources.</P>
    <P>The Government are also continuing the remedial works programme with £16 million this year.  This will allow for work on 75 housing schemes throughout the country.  I was particularly happy to see the Government providing funds for the installation of bathrooms or showers in local authority houses without them.  This is a very worth-while move by the Government which will encourage local authorities to make some resources of their own available in order to ensure over the coming years that every local authority dwelling has a bathroom.</P>
    <P>The Estimates make provision for the <Col N="1764" /> payment of various house grants and subsidies. Some of these schemes were abolished in 1987 but the Government are still providing funds to meet commitments arising under them.  The major grant scheme in operation is the new house grant scheme, and £7½ million is provided to meet grant payments arising this year. The Estimate also includes £1 million for house improvement grants, £290,000 for renewal or repair of thatched roofs and £2.6 million for grants for disabled persons and essential repair grants to houses in rural areas for the elderly.  The combined total of all these grants is £11,390,000.  The Estimate also includes £5 million for the old mortgage subsidy scheme.  Last year over 24,000 payments were made under this scheme, which was ended in 1986.</P>
    <P>In regard to our roads improvement programme, I was very pleased with the substantial amount allocated to the county road network.  This was very welcome and was much appreciated by local authorities throughout the country.  The Minister for the Environment made these grants available and gave them in a discretionary manner.  It was open to the local authority members and officials to decide how the money should be spent and they got great value for the money. I was very pleased, coming from the midlands, to see how the money was spent. The roads in the area are now in a very good condition.  Many people may say that much money is needed, especially for the county road network, and there is no doubt that is true; but, taking into account the resources of the local authorities together with the amount made available by the Department, a total of £120 million was spent on the county road network.  That is the highest sum spent in this area in the history of the State and it is very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to urban renewal.  I am extremely pleased at the manner in which the works are being carried out throughout the country.  We have seen major development taking place throughout the country, in Cork, Limerick, Mayo and including Castlebar, <Col N="1765" /> Tullamore, Letterkenny, Ennis and Dundalk. I appreciate the co-operation of the local authorities, private developers and the financial institutions.  We owe them a deep debt of gratitude for the success we have achieved.  We have to depend on private enterprise to give the lead and I thank them for the part they have played. The provision of tax incentives depends on private enterprise, initiatives and so on.  Since coming to office we have restored confidence in the economy.  I have no doubt that has been appreciated because we have created thousands of jobs under the urban renewal programme. It is all about creating the climate and restoring confidence in the economy.  The people fully realise that now.</P>
    <P>In the run-up to the local elections I said that in my Department &mdash; irrespective of who was Minister or what Government was in office &mdash; there was never enough money to take on all the projects.  We have taken on a vast number of projects such as water, sewerage, group water schemes, national road networks, the major road works throughout the country.  We have to work according to the finances available to us and that is how we will operate.  There is no point in anyone saying we want more housing &mdash; of course we do &mdash; and further development, but we must have the money available to us to do it.  We have to live according to the Estimate given to us in the budget.</P>
    <P>Overall in the last four years in the Department of the Environment with the resources available to us and the back-up from the local authorities we have done an enormous amount of work on pollution, the provision of water services, sewerage, sanitation, fire services and so on.  Great credit must go to the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, who is here with me this evening.  Within the limits of the resources and the finances available we are trying to divide the cake to the best of our ability.  We would like to do more but the money is not available and it can only come from the people. With our ability to lead from here on in we shall give the best service we can <Col N="1766" /> to the people at the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This afternoon we completed a day-long debate on the problems of the agricultural industry.  Tonight I will attempt to focus in on the problems relating to the tourism industry which is second to agriculture in its financial returns to this country.  It is now widely recognised that for 1991 there are serious problems confronting the industry, especially in the accommodation sector. This can be related to a dramatic fall in the volume of American tourists coming to Ireland, a reduction of 30 per cent on the 1990 figures to date over the first six months.  It is also reliably estimated that a 25 per cent drop in American tourism cost this country £67 million.  With the excess to date of over 25 per cent it must be accepted therefore, that the loss to the Irish economy is many millions of pounds more than £67 million at a time when we can ill-afford to lose such earnings.</P>
      <P>An indication of the seriousness of the situation at the peak of the 1991 tourist season is that hotels are putting staff on short time.  The unemployment figures for June clearly indicate that the normal annual take-up in the hotel and restaurant industry for this month has not materialised; had that happened there would be a substantial reduction on the unemployment figures.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 5 July, the tourism correspondent set the record straight when he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> Hoteliers were last night banking on a long, warm spell to ease the summer problems brought on by a serious slump in American and British tourist business.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of hotel bedrooms are empty and the big hope now is the Irish will opt to holiday at home in even greater numbers.</P>
    <P>So far the &ldquo;summer&rdquo; has conspired with the foreign recession and the Gulf War to make life difficult for an industry which has enjoyed three boom years.</P>
    <P>That article, with a leading article on the same date entitled &ldquo;Empty Bedrooms&rdquo;, fully demonstrates the serious aspect of the industry currently.  While undoubtedly the general idea is that the difficulties of the American tourist were created by the Gulf War, that is too simplistic an answer to explain the situation. While the Gulf War may have been responsible for a reduction in the number of American tourists travelling to Ireland in 1991 it certainly would not be responsible for a reduction of 30 per cent.  This is a matter that requires immediate and urgent investigation by the Minister, Bord Fáilte and the industry.  I contend that the present slump in the American trade is deeper and has more serious consequences.  I contend that the volume of State spending on marketing in America is not adequate.  In 1990 the industry put up £56 million for the general marketing and promotional programme and against that the State put up £18 million.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Border Area Security.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because it is one of the most frightening incidents which has happened in the Border area in the last 20 years of troubles in Northern Ireland.  It is appalling in what we believe to be a Christian society that acts of violence can be ruthlessly planned <Col N="1768" /> by people who call themselves &mdash; and believe others should call them &mdash; Christians. It is frightening that these people, acting as an armed gang, should invade the privacy of a home and hold a father, mother and seven children hostage while they primed a 3,000 lbs. bomb intending to kill or maim fellow human beings.</P>
      <P>When one considers that a 1,000 lbs. bomb caused so much damage at Cushquin on the Donegal-Derry border late last year, one gets some idea of the magnitude of the damage this evil deed could have caused if the ruthless gang had been permitted to continue their evil work.  It is more frightening to think that every family in the Border region is now a soft target for so-called Republicans claiming to act in the name of Irish people.  This new development in the IRA campaign of violence, where families close to the Border who are soft targets, can be used as proxy bombs can no longer be ignored by the Government.  Armed gangs cannot be allowed to act in such a manner.  It was fortunate that a roving Garda patrol car happened to be in the area, suspected that something was wrong and called at the home on Sunday night.  From what I can gather, if they had been a half an hour later it would have been too late. This new threat demands that the Government take immediate action to step up security arrangements in Border areas.  The Garda are doing a good job but we need more of them.  Ruthless armed gangs must not be allowed to terrorise families in Border areas; it is the duty of the Government to provide proper and adequate protection, and not to depend on Lady Luck, as happened on Sunday night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can imagine how frightening it is for a young family to be confronted by an armed gang who take possession of their home, invade their privacy and cause all kinds of frustrations and frightening thoughts in the minds of the young children whose parents were not at home. One can imagine the reception the parents got when they arrived home to be confronted by this; one can imagine what thoughts went through the father's head as he knew what happened to Patsy <Col N="1769" /> Gillespie at Cushquin about six months earlier when he was used as a proxy bomb to kill people wearing British uniforms, which is their justification for taking the life of a human being.  One can imagine the thoughts going through that family's mind as these things were happening.</P>
    <P>While all this is going on the Government are not providing adequate security or personnel for Border regions.  Every family living in the Border regions of Counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth are now soft targets, which must not be allowed. The Government can no longer ignore this peril which causes so much anguish to people living in those areas.  Every family is now in that category.  The family &mdash; I hesitate to use the name &mdash; who were the victims on Sunday night know the experience.  The family of Patsy Gillespie have already had the experience and every family, whether they own a vehicle or not, are subject to this kind of danger. They are in the front line of this war.</P>
    <P>This is the most devious, frightening and sinister development which I have come across since the troubles started.  I do not know the answer to it; if evil people plan deeds like this I do not know how they can be stopped.  However, one allows them to proceed if one turns ones back on them, treats them lightly or does not take them on.  There are not sufficient gardaí in Donegal at the moment to protect the lives and properties of the people in the area.  We need more gardaí and Army personnel.  This is a warning, we were lucky on Sunday night that the Garda prevented the bomb exploding, which would have caused a terrible disaster. The bomb was destined for the village of Clady, about two miles away or for the military check-point between Strabane and Lifford.  No matter which site they selected the damage would have been devastating, it would have wrecked private property within a mile of the explosion.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take this matter very seriously because the next time Lady Luck might not intervene.  If the Government do not do something about this I <Col N="1770" /> will hold the Minister responsible for the deaths of people in future explosions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident that I speak for the House when I condemn in the strongest possible terms those responsible for the events at Ballindrait, County Donegal on Sunday night and Monday morning last.  It is quite clear from the reports I have received that prompt action by the Garda prevented an attack on the security forces in Northern Ireland and, almost certainly, prevented significant loss of life.</P>
      <P>The House will, I am sure, also wish to join me in congratulating the Garda on their success in foiling this latest attempted PIRA attack.  The bomb being prepared at Ballindrait would have been ready for use if the Lifford patrol car had arrived on the scene a few minutes later. Their prompt response, taking account of the size of that bomb, almost certainly, therefore, prevented a major tragedy.</P>
      <P>With regard to those events, I am informed by the Garda authorities that at 11 p.m. on Sunday night armed men entered a family home taking hostage seven children, ranging in age from 16 years to 13 months, who were then in residence.  A short time later the parents of the children were also taken hostage. A member of the family was then forced to obtain a lorry on which the gang worked during the course of the early hours of Monday morning.  That work consisted of mounting a bomb comprising approximately 3,000 lbs. of home-made explosives in the trailer of the lorry incorporating a sophisticated triggering device.  The bomb was connected in such a way that the tractor part of the lorry could be disconnected from the trailer by activating a device which would, in turn, set off the bomb.  The gang also reinforced the interior of the cab with steel plating.  When the gardaí arrived just before 6 a.m. on Monday morning, the murderous scheme was foiled.  The gang immediately fled the scene leaving the lorry behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gardaí secured the scene and the major Border emergency plan was put <Col N="1771" /> into operation.  Searches of the area were instituted and the bomb was subsequently examined by an Army explosives opertional detonating team and made safe. As Garda investigations into the incident are continuing, I do not wish to elaborate on what I have said about the detail of the incident, or that investigation.  I would, however, assure the House that the matter is being rigorously investigated by the Garda with all the resources at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The Provisional IRA, in attempting to mount this latest outrage, have again demonstrated their complete disregard for the rights and lives of people on both sides of the Border.  That disregard can be seen first and foremost in the size of the bomb under construction &mdash; approximately 3,000 lbs &mdash; which was clearly intended to cause maximum loss of life and destruction of property in a totally indiscriminate fashion.  It also includes taking hostages and holding at gunpoint innocent families in order to obtain the means to mount their attacks &mdash; in this case, as I have said, the hostages included seven children, the youngest of whom was 13 months old and the eldest 16 years of age.  By their actions the Provisional IRA have shown that no consideration of normal decency or morality will be allowed to stand in their way and have again revealed their utter contempt and disregard for the people in whose name they purport to wage their campaign of murder and bombing.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Garda authorities are acutely conscious of the threat which the Provisional IRA continue to pose to the lives and liberty of all the people of this island.  Both the Government and the Garda remain steadfast in their determination to ensure that the Provisional IRA's campaign of violence will not succeed.  At present the Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied with the resources, both in personnel and equipment, assigned to all divisions in the Border area.  It is, I am sure, common cause that the people best placed to assess what is needed in this <Col N="1772" /> regard are the Garda authorities themselves and that it is prudent to be guided by their professional assessments in this regard.  The House may be assured also, of course, that those resources available are kept under constant review and that any adjustments in relation to resources, including the deployment of additional Garda or Army personnel which may prove necessary, will be made as needs dictate.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government and the Minister for Justice view the position very seriously.  We have the utmost confidence in the Garda Síochána, backed up by the Army, being able to deal with the very serious problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to respond.  This is one of those subjects that comes under the general area of women's issues.  It comes up again and again, never with a satisfactory resolution.</P>
      <P>The Government are not taking the crime of rape seriously, as indicated by the inadequate funds allocated to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  To date for 1991 the total allocation from Government sources has been £21,000 to fund a service that will cost £132,000 to the end of the year.  One questions the Minister for Health's perception of this organisation. Does he regard it merely as some worthy benevolent women's organisation rather than what it is &mdash; a unique and vital information and advice service for victims of crime, all of which victims happen to be women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strongest testimony to the incidence of rape in this country is the number of court reports in our daily newspapers. Every week horrific details of violent sex crimes are spelt out as women victims go through the trauma of giving evidence. The fact is that the cases we read about do not at all represent the true picture of rape in this country.  According to Olive <Col N="1773" /> Braiden of the Rape Crisis Centre, only 30 per cent of raped women report the crime to the Garda and only ten per cent of those cases actually end up in court. The women victims of sex abuse and rape and their families, who need information, support, legal advice and therapy, have nowhere else to go in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Minister may believe that other social agencies or individuals are duplicating the work of the Rape Crisis Centre but on the evidence presented at the present time that is just not the case.  The Rotunda Hospital sexual assault clinic carries out only medical examinations and necessary validations for legal action. It does not prepare victims for court cases, go to court with them or provide therapy programmes for their rehabilitation. For teenagers and adult victims of sexual violence outside the area serviced by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre there is only a patchy and uncertain service. Other services provided by the centre are a 24-hour telephone answering service and a training programme for those involved in sexual abuse care.</P>
    <P>I personally met a victim of rape quite recently.  She was an Irish American woman who had lived nine years in New York.  She came over to Kilkenny, got a flat and had just got a job.  After two weeks she woke up one night in her flat to find a man's hand over her face.  He assaulted her, he raped her twice, he tied her to the bed, he stuck a knife in her and he choked her.  She was almost left for dead.  The woman had to go to hospital, she had to come to Dublin for help and she went through the rigours of the court process.  Thankfully, the person who was caught pleaded guilty and the woman did not have to give evidence.  I listened to her, I saw her anguish and her great distress.  That is the reality of what is happening when we speak of rape.  That woman did not discover through the legal process, either locally in Kilkenny or in any other way, that she was entitled to damages from the Criminal Injuries Tribunal for her loss of earnings and her medical expenses.  That case brought home very clearly to me that it is essential <Col N="1774" /> to have a specialised service for those women.</P>
    <P>The centre has been contacted so far in 1991 by 1,593 people looking for help. At present it has a waiting list of 282.  I call on the Minister for Health to give an assurance that he will provide the £130,000 needed for the centre to survive this year or else indicate to the centre and to women victims where they can go to get the expert and immediate care that is now being provided by the professionals and volunteers at the Rape Crisis Centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been aware of the financial position of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre in recent years and has indeed come to their assistance on several occasions.  In 1988 and 1989 grants amounting to £120,000 were made to the centre to enable them to meet accumulated debts.  In 1990 funding for the various rape crisis centres, including the centre in Dublin, was provided from the special budget allocation by my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare. A grant of £50,000 was paid to the centre in 1990.  They recently received a grant of £10,000 for 1991 from the scheme of grants for locally based women's groups.  In addition to the abovementioned payments, the centre has been consistently funded in recent years by the Eastern Health Board.  In 1990 they received a grant of £21,500 from the health board and payments equalling that amount have been made in respect of 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of voluntary organisations within the health service is an important one.  They must work in co-operation with the health boards, fulfilling a necessary role, co-ordinating their services with those of the boards and, where possible, avoiding duplication of services.  My understanding of the position is that the Dublin centre does not have a major role to play in crisis situations but rather acts as a counselling and referral service for victims of rape and other sexual assaults. Recent victims of rape or sexual assault are, I am told, most likely to have been <Col N="1775" /> dealt with by the treatment unit in the Rotunda Hospital.  The major portion of the centre's work would appear to be with victims of past sexual abuse and, in particular, adult victims of child sexual abuse.  There are several other services, both statutory and voluntary, which provide similar help, and it is in that context that the need for liaison and co-operation with the health board arises in order to avoid duplication of services and to enable both the statutory and voluntary <Col N="1776" /> bodies to assist as many victims as possible.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, recently discussed the issue with members of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  I endorse his recommendation to them that the centre should contact the Eastern Health Board with a view to discussing their current financial position.</P>

      <Quest>whether the Government is not fully supporting implementation of the European Charter of Social Rights as an essential part of cohesion in discussions on economic and monetary union.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely reject the suggestion in the question that Ireland is not fully supporting implementation of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights.  Ireland is a signatory to the charter and is committed to it as a basis for achieving a strong social dimension to the Community to complement the economic objective of completion of the Single Market.  We are co-operating fully in implementing the charter through the individual proposals of the Commission's action programme.  Indeed, during the Irish Presidency of the Community in the first six months of 1990, I, as president-in-office of the Social Affairs Council, was instrumental in drawing up and securing agreement to a timetable for completion of the action programme.</P>
      <P>Our support for the charter and the Commission's action programme does not, of course, imply that we must automatically accept all the individual Commission proposals as they are submitted to the Council.  No member state could be expected to do this.  As is our responsibility and our invariable practice, we examine each proposal carefully and, as part of the normal negotiating process in which all member states are engaged, we contribute constructively to the debates on the substance and texts of draft Community instruments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our contributions to the debates at Community level we seek to ensure that draft instruments are adapted as far as possible to take account of our national circumstances, such as our legal system, our industrial relations and other practices and our financial capacity to support particular measures.  We endeavour to strike a balance between the desirability <Col N="1536" /> of making social progress in the interests of workers while avoiding the imposition of undue obligations on employers, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises.  Above all, though, we take into account the possible implications of all proposals for employment, which remains the main priority of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Social Affairs Council, at its most recent meeting on 25 June, adopted a directive which provides that non-standard (temporary) workers will have the same conditions of safety and health as other workers.  The Council also agreed the text of a directive on the provision to employees of information by way of proof of an employment contract concerning their terms and conditions of employment; this directive would have been adopted but for the fact that the opinion of the European Parliament had not been received.  Finally, as regards directives, the Council adopted a common position on a proposal for a directive on the minimum health and safety requirements for improved medical treatment on board vessels.  These three directives form part of the Commission action programme to implement the Community Charter on Fundamental Social Rights and their agreement which I strongly supported, represent concrete progress towards the implementation of the charter.</P>
    <P>This general approach which I have outlined is progressive, constructive and well-balanced.  It represents an approach which is in the best national interest and very much for the benefit of workers.</P>

      <P>As I have already pointed out in a comprehensive reply to a question on 27 February last, I am familiar with the Employment Equality Agency policy and initiatives in relation to sexual harassment and agree with the type of action which the chief executive officer has advocated.  I would like to put on record in this House my agreement with the clear statement by Ms Meehan that &ldquo;the time is running out for employers who believe that women should learn to ignore this problem or learn to deal with it.  The person who must deal with it is the employer, not the victim...&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This policy of affirmative action involving information and education campaigns, together with adapting grievance and disciplinary procedures to deal with sexual harassment, is in line with guidelines issued by both FIE and ICTU.  It is also in line with the code of conduct on preventing sexual harassment currently being drawn up by the EC Commission as a result of the resolution on sexual harassment which was adopted at my initiative by the Council of Social Affairs Ministers in May 1990.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the calculations made by the Deputy on the basis of figures which I supplied to the House on 28 May 1991 give a meaningful labour force picture of those leaving second-level education between 1988 and 1990.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the percentage mentioned in the Deputy's question was arrived at by disregarding those temporarily unavailable for work and school leavers who opted to continue with their further education.  Such students are, in effect, sensibly postponing labour market entry pending the acquisition of higher level qualifications and skills increasingly in demand in the labour market and to improve their career prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the method of calculation used by the Deputy all these students would be permanently omitted from the calculation despite the fact that <Col N="1539" /> they enter the labour market subsequently on completion of their studies.</P>
    <P>I believe the normal practice of calculating percentages of young people at work, in education, seeking a job, etc. in respect of each cohort, provides the most useful indication of the labour market situation for the cohort.</P>
    <P>When those in further education are taken into account, the level of unemployment among school leavers who had remained in Ireland fell from 19 per cent in 1988 to 14 per cent in 1990.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that educational qualifications are of the utmost importance in determining employment prospects: the latest school leavers' survey shows that almost 30 per cent of those who left school without qualifications were still seeking their first job one year later compared with 6.9 per cent of leaving certificate students.  For those with third-level qualifications the unemployment rate is even lower &mdash; standing at 3.7 per cent in 1989.</P>
    <P>In recognition of this the Government have given education at every level special priority in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> providing an additional 8,800 third-level places together with a significant expansion of the Youthreach Programme for unqualified school leavers and 1,000 extra apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>I am keeping the labour force position of young people under constant review to see what additional initiatives might be feasible to further improve the situation within available resources.</P>

      <P>There is no up-to-date estimate of the number of jobs that might be created in the public and private sectors if overtime were banned or restricted.  In practice, arriving at such an estimate presents significant, if not insurmountable, theoretical difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study which was carried out on behalf of my Department and published in 1980 showed that 51 million hours of overtime had been worked in the production sector between June 1978 and June 1979.  A further 21 million hours overtime had been worked in those parts <Col N="1543" /> of the services sector covered by the study.</P>
    <P>The survey suggested that around 12,000 jobs could be created by a reduction in overtime.  However, in any such reduction only 30 per cent of the hours would, at most, translate into full-time jobs.</P>
    <P>The data is, of course, now 12 years old and the estimate of jobs that could result was heavily qualified.</P>
    <P>In 1986, a study of <i>Worksharing and the Public Sector</i> was published by the Institute of Public Administration.  The study had been commissioned and financed by the then Department of the Public Service.</P>
    <P>The reasons for overtime in the Civil Service most frequently cited, according to the study, ranged from &ldquo;service outside normal hours&rdquo; to &ldquo;providing cover for staff absent on sick or annual leave&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As far as commercial enterprises and the private sector are concerned, it is a matter for management and workers to agree on working-time arrangements through the normal negotiation process having regard to the basic imperatives of efficiency, productivity and competitiveness while respecting existing legislation on hours of work.</P>
    <P>I should point out that a draft directive on the organisation of working time has been drawn up by the EC Commission as part of the social action programme for the implementation of the European Social Charter.</P>

      <P>Shortly after its establishment I wrote to the Labour Relations Commission suggesting a number of areas, including the question of dispute procedures, on which codes of practice might be prepared.</P>
      <P>Arising from the recent dispute in the ESB, priority attention is being given to the preparation of a code of practice which will cover dispute procedures and the question of levels of cover to be provided in the event of disputes in essential services.</P>
      <P>In drawing up the code, the Commission is required under the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, to consult ICTU, FIE and other interested bodies.  On 7 June the Commission circulated to the various bodies concerned a discussion document covering a range of issues which might be included in the code of practice.  The Commission has discussed the documents with the organisations concerned.  On the basis of these consultations a final draft of the code will be drawn up and approved by the Commission. On receipt of the code from the Commission I will by order declare the code to be a code of practice for the purposes of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of approaches in my strategy to encourage employers to take positive action to promote equal opportunities. For example, last year I <Col N="1546" /> launched the equality focus award scheme, which is sponsored by the Employment Equality Agency and the EC in co-operation with the Irish branch of the Institute of Personnel Management. The aim of this scheme is to encourage employers both in the public and private sectors to implement positive action initiatives and to give recognition to the efforts which companies are already taking.  I undertook, in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, to develop the scheme in association with the Agency.</P>
      <P>In addition to initiatives to reward outstanding effort, the second element of my strategy is to stimulate ongoing review of progress in order to ensure the success of equal opportunity policies and programmes and to overcome possible resistance to change.  I consider the public sector as an appropriate proving ground for new concepts of positive action and that it has an obligation to give leadership to the private sector.  The first report of equal opportunities in State-sponsored bodies which I published in January of this year showed that there is considerable scope for progress.  I have extended the process of monitoring to local authorities and health boards.  One of the most valuable by-products of this exercise will be the creation of databases so that organisations can establish targets and plan and organise to achieve those targets.  I expect that representatives of employers and workers will be involved in the follow-up of that exercise.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the extent to which equal opportunity policy and guidelines for the Civil Service is being monitored by unions and management dealing with, among other things, recruitment and selection, promotion, training and development, and combining work with family responsibilities.  The model thus developed and the clear guidance which has been provided in this matter by both the ICTU and the FIE should serve to inform more and more employers in the private sector about the advantages and the modalities of introducing positive action programmes.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that in general State and semi-State agencies comply with the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, which confers an entitlement to equal pay.  Accordingly, I do not consider it necessary to initiate a review on the lines proposed by the Deputy on the basis of a single case.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the 40 per cent differentiation between the average industrial wage for men and women in this country; if he will outline the proposals, if any, he has to bridge this differentiation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the substantial difference between the average industrial wages for men and women and I agree that the situation is far from satisfactory.  I should explain, however, that the differences in industrial earnings result from a wide range of factors.  These include levels of wage rates, but also hours worked, overtime payments, shift or unsocial hours premia, payments by results, bonuses for output levels and payments for length of service.  It is as well to recognise also that industrial wage statistics cover only a percentage of women who are at work, many of whom are segregated into certain low pay areas and confined to a restricted range of jobs.</P>
      <P>While I intend to make a number of changes to the employment equality legislation to simplify it and make it more effective, in the context of reducing and eventually eliminating the differential which exists, I would attach greater importance to improving access for women to a wider range of jobs and jobs at higher levels.  In that regard several steps are already being taken, particularly in the areas of improved training and access to employment and positive action.</P>
      <P>I am particularly anxious that further positive action programmes are implemented in both the public and private sectors.  Towards that end, in conjunction with the EEA during 1990, I launched the equality focus award scheme to encourage employers to implement positive action initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have already <Col N="1549" /> adopted positive action policies in the Civil Service, State bodies, health boards and local authorities.  At present relevant training programmes are being developed in conjunction with the Employment Equality Agency and the Institute of Public Administration.  The Employment Equality Agency is on its own account, actively continuing its work in promoting positive action.  In the area of training, the FÁS positive action programme seeks to improve the position of women in the labour market.  The Department of Education are making determined efforts to eliminate sexism and sex-stereotyping in the educational field.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these and other initiatives will help to improve the situation, but I am aware that continuing and determined efforts are necessary if the whole problem is to be successfully addressed.</P>

      <Quest>when the final payment will be made to those employed in the compilation of the national census; and the reason there has been such a long delay in the making of this payment.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The temporary field force recruited by the Central Statistics Office to conduct the 1991 Census of Population consisted of: (a) 334 persons employed in various supervisory grades on a temporary full-time basis; and (b) 3,206 persons employed as temporary part-time enumerators.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of their census of population duties some 154 supervisors and 1,139 enumerators were retained for the census of agriculture (mainly in rural areas).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Salary levels for the temporary supervisory posts consisted of a fixed weekly amount plus a terminal bonus payable on satisfactory completion of duties.  In addition to all weekly payments being made on a current basis terminal bonuses <Col N="1550" /> have already been paid to those supervisors not retained for the census of agriculture. A combined terminal bonus, reflecting their duties on both censuses, will issue to supervisors retained for the census of agriculture on completion of their work and as soon as the relevant certifying documentation is received in CSO.</P>
    <P>Enumerators were paid on a fee basis. The fee involved consideration of a number of distinct elements, such as: training; number of enumerated households; number of enumerated institutions (and their size); number of premises not containing households; business listings; summarisation; travel allowances; bonus for satisfactory completion of duties.</P>
    <P>For some elements the level of payment also varied depending on whether the enumerator worked in an urban or rural area.  The payment of enumerators, therefore, was not a straightforward matter and involved individual calculations in every case on the basis of reports from the supervisory field staff. Excluding travel allowances, the payments were also subject to the statutory provisions governing PAYE and PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>In most cases the enumerators completed their census of population duties towards the end of May and the reports from supervisors came in during early June &mdash; this was the earliest moment from which the individual calculations could commence.  Since for obvious reasons all the individual calculations could not be completed and checked simultaneously, it is unavoidable that payments should extend over a few weeks.  Every attempt was made to expedite payment in cases where it was known that enumerators were in particularly difficult personal circumstances.</P>
    <P>Finally, it must be pointed out that between March and May the enumerators generally received eight weekly payments of £55 (amounting to £440 in total) by way of an advance of their fees while the work was still ongoing.  The delay in payment was in respect of the balance due which in some cases was <Col N="1551" /> quite small.  At this stage final balancing payments have been made to all but eight of the 2,067 enumerators not retained for the census of agriculture.</P>

    <P>The direct benefit to the local community includes the employment of up to 24 staff during times of peak fishing activity at an approximate cost of £100,000 per annum, the purchase locally of supplies and equipment amounting to approximately £30,000 per annum and the payment to the North Western Regional Fisheries Board of £27,000 in fishery rates.  My Department does not quantify exactly the indirect benefits of the fishery to the locality but I would quote, in this regard, from the Economic and Social Research Institute's <i>Economic Evaluation of Irish Angling (1988)</i> which estimated that expenditure per foreign angler amounted to just over £500, main items of expenditure being accommodation, meals and travel to Ireland. It was estimated that Irish anglers on overnight trips spent an average of £302, one-third of which was spent on accommodation and meals.  Approximately 1,600 anglers visited the Moy Fishery in 1990.  Of these 80 per cent were Irish <Col N="1554" /> (including Northern Ireland) and 20 per cent were from outside Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of indigenous energy resources forms a crucial element of the Government's energy strategy, since it improves the security of supply, leads to a greater diversity of fuels and improves our balance of payments.</P>
      <P>In the area of alternative energy development, I recently announced that agreement had been reached with the ESB to increase the price which the board pay for electricity supplied to the grid from non-fuel renewable energy sources. This price increase reflects the benefits of the power produced from these indigenous renewable sources which, of course, are pollution free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two alternative energy sources generally regarded as having the greatest potential are hydro and wind energy. Most of Ireland's hydro potential has already been exploited and many of the remaining sites will undoubtedly be more <Col N="1569" /> difficult and costly to develop.  The prospects for the limited number of remaining hydro sites will also depend on changing economic conditions and other issues such as concern for the environment.</P>
    <P>In regard to wind energy, the Deputy may be aware that I announced in April that a consortium involving Irish and Danish interests had been chosen to undertake the construction, operation and maintenance at Bellacorick, County Mayo of Ireland's first wind farm to supply electricity to the ESB.</P>
    <P>This wind farm project is being grantaided under the EC Valoren programme which is designed to assist the development of certain less favoured regions of the Community by exploiting indigenous energy resources.  Other areas which have benefited under this programme include peat development by Bord na Móna, energy conservation campaigns and small-hydro schemes.</P>
    <P>As regards peat development, the Government's policy is that Bord na Móna must continue their efforts to place the company on a sound financial and commercial footing in order to ensure the viability of the organisation into the next century.  The steps taken in recent years by the board have had the effect of returning the company to profitability and this positive operational performance is projected to continue.  The Government are determined to ensure that Bord na Móna will continue to carry out their role as a commercial peat development company so that peat will continue to provide a significant proportion of our energy requirements and so that the company will remain an important contributor to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>One of the important aspects of the development of indigenous energy resources relates to the ongoing efforts to discover new sources of oil and gas offshore. There were four exploration wells drilled in 1989, four in 1990 and I anticipate that up to three wells will be drilled this year. One of the 1989 wells, drilled by Marathon in the Celtic Sea, located the Ballycotton Gas Field.  Development work on the field is now complete and the first <Col N="1570" /> delivery of natural gas from Ballycotton took place last Thursday, 4 July 1991. Although modest in size compared to the Kinsale Head Gas Field, Ballycotton has a particular significance in that it is the first commercial development of hydrocarbon reserves offshore Ireland since the seventies.  It is also the first time that hydrocarbons are being recovered off our coasts by means of a subsea well-head production system.</P>
    <P>In order to stimulate exploration effort in our deep water, so-called &ldquo;frontier areas&rdquo;, I recently announced that a licensing round will be held in 1993, covering areas of the Erris and Slyne Troughs off our western seaboard.  This will give interested companies adequate time to acquire, process and interpret the additional seismic data over the areas in question which will be necessary to enable them to make decisions relating to licence applications, and supporting work programmes, under the round.  This will be the first licensing round to have been held in relation to acreage offshore Ireland since 1985.</P>
    <P>Consistent with encouraging hydrocarbons exploration and ultimately production offshore Ireland the Government have decided to incorporate petroleum taxation legislation within the provisions of the Finance Bill, 1992.  Although a Bill in this area was published in 1985 it was not proceeded with and lapsed.  Consequently Ireland has currently no petroleum taxation legislation.  Continuing doubt in this area impacts negatively on promotion of Ireland as a location for hydrocarbons exploration and places this country at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> others with clearly defined taxation regimes in seeking to attract mobile exploration investment.  The Government's decision to bring forward legislation in this area in 1992 will serve to eliminate an important element of uncertainty experienced by the industry as regards the risk-reward relativities of operating in Ireland and as such should play a part in encouraging further exploration effort.  Work on preparing the detail <Col N="1571" /> of petroleum taxation legislation proposals is underway, now that this year's Finance Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>I have decided that it is time to take another look at our offshore licensing terms, which were last revised in 1987, to see if there are any adjustments which might be appropriate, consistent with promoting exploration effort through the nineties.  The review will be conducted over coming months.  I have asked my Department to look into all aspects of the terms and to pay special regard to the particular circumstances of exploration in deep-water &ldquo;frontier&rdquo; acreage.  I see all of these measures as furthering the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for Government</i> to facilitate accelerated drilling programmes.  The continued development of markets for indigenous natural gas is an important element of the Government's energy policy.  Bord Gais Éireann have a statutory responsibility to develop and maintain a system for the transmission and distribution of natural gas and to earn a reasonable return on capital investment. Mindful of these obligations, the board are currently involved in drawing up a programme for the connection of non gas housing estates in the greater Dublin area and other urban centres.  Under this programme 8,000 homes will be offered a supply this year.</P>
    <P>Planning is now well advanced for a proposal to extend the gas grid this year westward from Dundalk to serve industrial-commercial customers in counties Louth and Cavan.  This project will be eligible for EC funding under the Commisson's border areas programme.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the consequences of the new PRSI rates relating to part-time workers on the Irish mushroom industry whereby 18.25 per cent will be added to the cost of picking one pound of mushrooms which will result in (1) growers looking at alternative means of harvesting and reducing the number of employees, (2) the growth of the industry being curtailed and (3) exports of mushrooms being less competitive on the United Kingdom market; if he will alleviate this situation by reverting the rates to those pre April 1991 or by providing an exemption for the industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Since 6 April 1991 full social insurance has been introduced for part-time workers.  The effect is that all workers, in all industries and sectors, earning £25 or more in a week, irrespective of hours worked, now have entitlements to important social welfare benefits such as disability benefit and widows and old age pensions.</P>
      <P>The standard class A rate of social security contribution is 5.5 per cent for employees and 12.2 per cent for employers.  If, however, an employee earns £60 or less per week, he or she is exempt from a social insurance deduction for that week.  The cost to the employer or providing this social insurance for an employee will be £3.05 per week at the £25 level and £4.88 per week at the £40 level of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department recently met with representatives of the Irish Mushroom Growers' Association at which the PRSI liability position was outlined and arrangements were agreed <Col N="1573" /> for the collection of PRSI contributions from mushroom growers.</P>
    <P>The Government are conscious of the need to keep employer costs in industry under control.  However, the employer social insurance contribution here is one of the lowest in Europe.  PRSI contributions are an integral part of the social welfare system, reflecting the need for comprehensive protection for workers and their families.</P>
    <P>I could not agree to any change which would disadvantage these employees in such a fundamental way.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 73, 76, 78, 79 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The dispute between my Department and the Irish Dental Association arose because of the opposition of the association to the extension of the dental benefit scheme to dependent spouses of insured workers in 1987.  As part of their opposition to the extension, the association have called on their members to discontinue providing certain treatments for all insured persons.  As a result, some dentists are imposing charges, which are not in accordance with their contracts, for extractions, root treatments and dentures.</P>
      <P>Discussions are continuing between officials of my Department and the Irish Dental Association in an effort to resolve this dispute.  To date 276 dentists have signed the new agreement.</P>
      <P>92,913 claims for dental benefit have been received to date from dependent spouses since the extension of the scheme in 1987.  In 1990, a total of 25,125 claims for dental benefit were received from dependent spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is considered that most dependent spouses wishing to apply for dental benefit can be catered for by those practitioners who have already signed the new contract.  I would like as many dental practitioners as possible to participate in the extended scheme of dental benefit <Col N="1575" /> for dependent spouses, so that a fuller service can be provided.  I am also anxious that the service withdrawn by a number of dentists in relation to extractions, root treatments and dentures be resumed as soon as possible.  I am therefore concerned that the discussions with the Irish Dental Association, now at an advanced stage, be brought to a positive conclusion as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The additional fuel allowance of £3 per week which I introduced at the start of the 1990-91 heating season was designed to help low income households in the built up areas of Dublin meet the additional costs arising from the ban on bituminous coal.

      <P>In keeping with the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and <Col N="1578" /> Social Progress</i> my Department are preparing a White Paper on the role of voluntary organisations in the social services area.  This will involve drawing up a charter for voluntary social services which will set out a clear framework for partnership between the State and voluntary activity.</P>
      <P>The White Paper will address such issues as the nature and the extent of voluntary social services activity; the supports currently provided by the State sector; the current relationships between the statutory and voluntary sectors and how the State can encourage and support voluntary activity in the social services area.</P>
      <P>Preliminary work associated with the preparation of the White Paper has now been completed.  This involved documenting the nature of voluntary activity in Ireland and the supports currently provided by the State sector.  My Department have also had initial consultations with many of the key voluntary organisations in the social services area, other Government Departments and with relevant State-sponsored bodies including the Combat Poverty Agency and the National Social Services Board.  In addition, discussions have also taken place between my Department and relevant statutory and voluntary organisations in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>An advertisement was placed in the national press on 19 May 1991, and in newsletters with a circulation to voluntary groups, inviting interested organisations and individuals to contact my Department.  This will be followed by a brief questionnaire to respondents which will enable my Department compile a comprehensive profile of interested organisations working in the social services area to identify the issues which voluntary groups would wish to see addressed in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>At the same time a number of groups, representing a cross-section of the main types of voluntary organisations in the social services area, have been approached seeking their views on the issues to be addressed in the charter.</P>

      <P>I am very aware of the financial needs of families with children and I have made significant progress in recent budgets in improving the position of such families. This has included increases in the basic rates of payments and substantial increases in child dependent payments. Child benefit payments have also been increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987, there were 36 child dependant rates with a minimum rate of £6.  In the 1991 budget, the minimum child dependant rate was increased to £12 representing a 100 per cent increase.  The number of rates was streamlined to three.  Also, child dependant allowances were extended to age 21 in respect of the child dependants of all long term recipients <Col N="1580" /> where the child remains in full-time education.</P>
    <P>Other improvements in child-related payments were the payment of the higher child benefit of £22.90 in respect of fourth child onwards, which represents an annual increase of over £85 for families of at least four children; substantial improvements in the family income supplement scheme including an increase in the income limits and the abolition of the maximum payments &mdash; this latter improvement will be of significant help to low earners and the introduction of a back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance scheme providing for families on social welfare, up to £25 each for children in primary school and £40 for children in second level schools for back to school costs.</P>
    <P>In addition, for families at work on low pay, the child related tax exemption scheme, with effect from 6 April 1991, provides for a child tax exemption of £300 for the first and second child in a family, and £500 for third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the Government are committed to providing the resources necessary to implement the additional child income support measures recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare &mdash; some £69 million in 1990 terms &mdash; over the ten year period of the programme.  The particular measures taken will be decided in the light of up-to-date information on child and family circumstances and taking account of available resources.  The issue of age-related child dependant payments will be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>The following example illustrates the increase in payments for a family on long term unemployment assistance with five children between 1987 and 1991:</P>

      <P>The means test criteria are broadly similar for all schemes although there are variations in the manner in which some of the components, principally capital and income from earnings are assessed.  For example the rules of means assessment in the case of widows, lone parents and the elderly are generally more favourable.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, further attention will be given to greater integration of social assistance provisions and streamlining of means tests to ensure a more effective and client-oriented system.  This will include the greater integration into the social welfare system of the supplementary welfare allowance provisions and other related provisions currently administered by the health boards.  The issues are under review in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already in this year's budget introduced means test improvements whereby income derived from casual employment as a home-help is disregarded. A minimum weekly payment <Col N="1582" /> of £5 was also introduced for unemployment assistance claimants whose current entitlement is less than £5 and whose only means is the yearly value of free board and lodgings at home.</P>
    <P>The administrative procedures for means-testing are kept under constant review with a view to reducing the need to visit claimants in their homes.  Increasingly desk interviewing is being used where possible to establish means and thus reduce the time taken to put claims into payment.  All social welfare officers dealing directly with claimants now carry out desk interviews at least one day per week.  This has reduced considerably the need for claimants to seek supplementary welfare allowance until their claims are decided, particularly in relation to the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>

Under present legislation, where no contributions were awarded for two consecutive contribution years, a credited contribution cannot be granted until the insured person has paid 26 contributions. When the people concerned have accumulated 26 paid contributions at the class A1 rate they will be entitled to the award of credited contributions for periods of proved unemployment.</P>

      <P>At present, an applicant for old age non-contributory pension with assessed means of up to £6 per week can qualify for a full pension of £53 per week, £55 from later this month.  Where the applicant has means in excess of £6 per week a reduced old age pension is payable depending on the amount of his means.  The reduction in the basic rate of <Col N="1584" /> pension is £2 for each additional £2 of means.</P>
      <P>A living alone allowance is payable in addition to the basic rate of pension if the pensioner is living alone.  This is a separate allowance which does not form part of the basic pension.  It is payable to all persons aged 66 or over qualifying for a social welfare pension who are living alone and is not subject to a means test. It is therefore not taken into account when determining the amount of basic pension payable in any case.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 96 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities <Col N="1588" /> that provisional figures indicate that there was an increase in the level of recorded larcenies, in both urban and rural areas, in 1990 as compared with 1989.  A number of measures are being taken by the Garda to deal with the problem.  These include the use of additional patrols and check-points and the deployment of Garda resources to meet the special requirements of particular areas.  In addition, the Garda are continuing to encourage and promote community involvement in crime-prevention activities through the community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes.  The Garda authorities are monitoring the situation closely and will take whatever measures may be necessary to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I am aware of public concern about the problems of crime and vandalism in certain parts of Dublin, in particular. Provisional figures for the first five months of this year show an increase in crime in certain areas.  I should point out, however, that estimated figures gathered over a relatively short period cannot be regarded as being firmly indicative of a longer term trend.  The Garda authorities do not await confirmation of trends before they act and they have informed me that they have already put specific measures in place in certain parts of Dublin city and elsewhere to counteract the increased incidence of crime.  In addition to the general measures already described above, these specific measures include greater deployment of plain-clothes surveillance units and the targeting of Garda resources to meet specific anti-crime needs in particular areas.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that these measures will prove effective in tackling the problems which have given rise to concern in certain Dublin suburbs of late.</P>
    <P>It is important to put the problem in Dublin in perspective.  The level of recorded indictable crime in the DMA decreased by approximately 8 per cent in 1989 as compared with the corresponding figures for 1988 and provisional figures indicate that the level decreased in 1990 by a further 2.9 per cent.  The situation in the DMA is being very closely monitored by the Garda authorities and I am <Col N="1589" /> satisfied that whatever further action may be appropriate to deal with the problems in the area will be taken.</P>

      <P>The reference in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to a review of the juvenile justice system should be read in conjunction with the statement I issued on youth policy initiatives on 5 December last and the contribution which I made in this House on 20 February to the debate on the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of juvenile justice I am concerned to develop programmes and initiatives which will help to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime; to guide those who have started to slip into crime back to a law-abiding lifestyle; and to assist the rehabilitation of those young people who have entered the custodial system administered by the Department of Justice.  To this end I initiated an ongoing review of the juvenile justice system within my Department, the early fruits of which are <Col N="1590" /> detailed in the statements to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I will outline very briefly, some of the progress which has been made.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Garda Juvenile Liaison Service</i>
    </P>
    <P>A national office to supervise the service was established last December.  Juvenile liaison officers were then put on the seven day roster to facilitate evening and weekend working.  The length of time spent with, and the number of visits made to, young people on the scheme will be varied to reflect the extent to which continuing supervision is required on an individual basis.  Work is also at an advanced stage on new procedural guidelines for the operation of the scheme's cautioning and supervision system and a new training curriculum for juvenile liaison officers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Garda Schools Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>Based on a pilot project developed by the Garda and St. Patrick's Teacher Training College, Drumcondra, and carried out in Tallaght in 1990, a Garda schools programme, which aims to develop positive attitudes towards law enforcement and the Garda, is now in operation in 14 Dublin schools.  It will be extended to Limerick, Waterford and Cork in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Community-Based Initiatives</i>
    </P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service, with local Garda support, is actively involved in the implementation of community-based programmes designed to effectively direct youngsters away from law breaking.  Already three specialised remedial projects have commenced at Cherry Orchard and in the CoolockDarndale area in Dublin and in Southhill, Limerick.</P>
    <P>Other measures which are being taken are the assignment of extra probation and welfare officers to areas where the incidence of crime is high and the utilisation of the resources of statutory and voluntary social agencies elsewhere.</P>
    <P>With regard to those children and young people whom the courts decide must be committed to custodial institutions, the position is that the provision <Col N="1591" /> of special accommodation for boys under 16 years of age and girls under 17 is a matter for the Department of Education; and my colleague, the Minister for Education, is providing additional such accommodation at Lusk, County Dublin. These places will come on stream very shortly.  Young offenders over those ages for the most part detained, in the case of males, in St. Patrick's Institution and Wheatfield and, in the case of females, in the women's prison at Mountjoy. Wheatfield is a modern facility where emphasis is placed on education and work training for young offenders.  An extensive programme of refurbishment of St. Patrick's and the women's prison is under way which will upgrade the facilities in those institutions.</P>
    <P>A Juvenile Justice Bill to replace the Children's Act, 1908, is also being prepared in my Department and will be introduced in due course.</P>
    <P>To ensure maximum co-operation between the Departments who have responsibilities for the welfare of children and young persons &mdash; i.e. the Department of Justice, Health and Education &mdash; all work in this area is being co-ordinated by an inter-departmental committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Chris Flood.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the number of young offenders dealt with under the juvenile liaison officer scheme declined from 3,700 in 1987 to 2,700 in 1989, especially in view of the continuing problem of juvenile crime; the steps he intends to take to promote the greater use of the juvenile liaison officer scheme; when the national juvenile liaison scheme, promised in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress will be established; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>There is no quota for the number of juvenile offenders to be dealt with under the <Col N="1592" /> juvenile liaison officer scheme and the work involved for JLOs can vary considerably from case to case.  The reduction in the number of juveniles dealt with under the scheme in 1989 as compared with 1987 owes more to the exceptional number of juveniles who were admitted to the scheme in 1987 than to any diminution in the efforts of JLOs in the later year.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a national juvenile liaison office, which is already operational, is only one of a number of significant reforms introduced in the juvenile liaison officer scheme to enhance its operation.  Other important reforms include new reporting and supervision arrangements for JLOs, flexibility in the period of supervision of youngsters, as well as restoration of weekend working and enhanced training for gardaí assigned to these duties.  The combination of all these measures is intended to ensure that an improved JLO scheme is made available for all suitable young offenders.</P>

      <P>The R292, Sligo-Strandhill Road is a regional road.  The cost of improving non-national roads such as this falls to be financed by the local authorities from their own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants for improvement works provided annually by my Department. The discretionary grants for improvement works allocated to Sligo County Council for 1991 amount to £1,452,000.</P>
      <P>The allocations already notified to local authorities absorb in full the funds available to me for road grants in 1991 and there are no further funds at my disposal from which additional road grants could be provided at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is untrue to state that units costing £100 million have been lying idle.  Figures of this order are misleading because they relate to the total value of the buildings concerned, including the portions which have already been opened.  Of those buildings which were the subject of discussion at the Public Accounts Committee in October 1990, the units at Mullingar, the Mater, Cavan and Castlebar have been opened.  In addition the 50-bed psychiatric unit at Tralee was opened recently.</P>
    </Speaker>

Substantial further progress will be made during this year in commissioning the unopened parts of Cheeverstown and Áras Attracta, Swinford.</P>
    <P>There is always an element of maintenance, security and heating cost in any commissioning process and the total cost under this heading will depend on factors such as whether the unit concerned is a stand alone unit or is part of a larger building, and the length of time required to commission the facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the health statue of Irish people and their life expectancy could be improved.  I have, on many occasions, drawn attention to this fact.  Indeed it has been the rationale behind many of the intitiatives I have taken in the last few years, particularly in the area of health promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in recognition of the fact that we needed greater co-ordination in our efforts to promote the health of our community and, by implication, improve life expectancy, that I reorganised the health promotion structures at national level. As the Deputy is aware, the health promotion framework now has four main elements: a Cabinet subcommittee to ensure that the policies of relevant <Col N="1605" /> Government Departments support health, an Advisory Council on Health Promotion to make recommendations to me on priorities in this area, a Health Promotion Unit &mdash; the executive and policy formulation function at national level &mdash; and, most recently, a chair of health promotion in University College Galway to provide a teaching and research resource in health promotion.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the major causes of death, including premature deaths, in Ireland, as in many developed countries, are heart disease and cancer. Most recent available statistics show that in 1989 diseases of the heart and circulatory system accounted for 47 per cent of all deaths.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death, accounting for 23 per cent of deaths.  These diseases can be viewed as major contributors to our unfavourable life expectancy.  As a country we compare quite favourably with countries such as Italy, France, Spain and Belgium in terms of the number of deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke in men in the 30-69 year age group, for example. Other countries such as Finland, America and Canada, have achieved significant reductions in coronary heart disease. Some of this reduction is attributed to community-based projects aimed at reducing the risk factors for coronary heart disease &mdash; smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, alcohol abuse &mdash; and encouraging healthy lifestyles.</P>
    <P>For this reason the Kilkenny Health Project was initiated as a major pilot project with a brief to develop, implement and evaluate a communitybased health promotion programme to prevent cardiovascular disease.  The programme is now being evaluated both in terms of its effect on the lifestyle of the people of County Kilkenny and also in terms of its potential for integration into the health service structures nationwide having regard to such matters as feasibility and cost effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Lifestyle behaviours such as smoking are risk factors not only for heart disease and stroke but also for some cancers, most notably lung cancer, and for <Col N="1606" /> diseases like bronchitis and emphysema. Other lifestyle factors implicated in the causation of preventable diseases are alcohol abuse, lack of exercise and unhealthy food choices.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit have invested significant funds in the development of a lifewise programme which address these issues.  Lifewise is a health education programme for adults which focuses on promoting healthy behaviour and provides the individual with the skills, information and motivation to develop and maintain a healthy lifestyle.  An important feature of the programme is its flexibility for use in a variety of settings.  The programme is being piloted in the Mid-Western Health Board and because of its success to date a number of other boards, <i>viz.</i> North-East-ern, Midland, Southern and South-Eastern, have asked to be party to the programme.  A new training programme was recently arranged involving participants from all the interested boards and also from the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  A national structure to oversee the development of the project and ensure its quality is being developed.</P>
    <P>In relation to alcohol, a comprehensive national policy on alcohol is currently being developed under the aegis of the Advisory Council on Health Promotion. This policy will examine the broad range of social, cultural, economic, legal and educational issues involved and will pay particular attention to the question of youth and alcohol.  A number of initiatives have already been taken in relation to alcohol use by young people &mdash; most significantly the launch of the Drink Awareness for Youth Programme aimed at 14-19 year olds to encourage them to make responsible decisions about alcohol use.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of the health promotion unit's activities each year is an anti-smoking campaign.  A legislative framework which supports health promotion programmes is an important component in a strategy to improve health status.  In that regard the anti-smoking legislation which we have <Col N="1607" /> introduced should make a significant contribution in the long term to reducing deaths from smoking, of which there are currently 5,000 per year in Ireland.  I am also confident that the increase of 10p in the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes introduced by the Government in the January budget will help in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have also recently established a Nutrition Advisory Group under the aegis of the Advisory Council on Health Promotion to provide expert advice to my Department and to the general public in the area of nutrition and to combat misinformation.  The unit have also developed a nutrition health promotion five-year framework for action, which was launched on 2 July 1991.  There is now persuasive evidence to link unhealthy food choices to ill-health.  The cornerstone of the framework for action will be the promotion of my Department's healthy eating guidelines among various targeted groups in the community.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit provide financial support to a wide range of voluntary organisations and also have a public information service through which a variety of education materials on health topics are made available free to the public.</P>
    <P>I might add that several of the projects carried out by the unit are taking place under the auspices of the Europe against Cancer Programme, which aims to reduce deaths from cancer by 15 per cent in the European region by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit are also liaising with relevant organisations such as the Health and Safety Authority in pursuing the commitment which the Government gave under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to utilise the potential offered by the workplace to promote healthy lifestyles.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the health promotion measures I have outlined, together with the maintenance of a high quality health service, will lead to improvements in the health status &mdash; including life expectancy &mdash; of our population in the coming years.</P>

The board hope to introduce a more structured programme within the next few months.  In addition, <Col N="1610" /> a pilot project involving the Mater Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service, Temple Street Hospital and the Eastern Health Board, who provide a treatment service for a number of adolescent abusers, has recently commenced.  The need to provide a similar service in other health board areas will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The contract for the extension to Ballymote national school, County Sligo, was recently placed and it is expected that building works will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>The school authorities of Kilross national school, County Sligo, have been authorised to proceed with the project subject to certain conditions to which my Department are committed.</P>
      <P>In May 1991 the Department authorised the invitation of tenders for the project and subject to receipt of a suitable tender the placing of the contracts will be promptly approved.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposed new national school at Ballytivanan to replace the St. Edwards building, I refer the Deputy to my reply to his parliamentary question on 3 July 1991.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the availability of the capital must always be a factor in determining when a contract can be placed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, I am totally averse to delays being caused to air travellers regardless of whether they are tourists or at what period of the year they are travelling.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that there will be few, if any, delays due to Irish Air Traffic Control during coming months.  The capacity of the Irish ATC system has been considerably expanded through a £30 million re-equipment programme and an intensive recruitment programme that has increased ATC staffing from 220 officers in 1989 to 273 staff at present.  Aviation is, of course, an international activity and delays may arise due to infrastructural or congestion problems in other countries.</P>
      <P>To eliminate the delays that occur outside Irish airspace, I have been pressing through our membership of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) and of Eurocontrol, the European ATC Agency, for the necessary action to be taken rapidly to relieve air traffic congestion in Europe.  Eurocontrol are at present, at the request of the ECAC Ministers of Transport, engaged in major staff recruitment and investment programmes aimed at bringing about the expansion of air traffic control capacity in Europe as rapidly as possible.</P>
