      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 12 and 13.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House that: (1) business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m., (2) the proceedings on the Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 12, and on the Committee Stage of No. 13, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12.00 noon and 10.30 p.m. respectively by one question in each case which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the member of the Government in charge of the Bill, and (3) Private Members' Business, which shall be No. 20, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>My party profoundly object to the proposal to impose a guillotine on the Competition Bill.  The responsible Minister who for some reason is not even in the House at the moment has claimed that this is a very important piece of legislation, and he is correct.  It is also complex legislation and it is wrong that the House which has been dealing <Col N="1542" /> expeditiously with it should be forced to deal with it under an unnecessary guillotine motion.  This is novel legislation so far as this country is concerned.  We have never had outright bans on anti-competitive practices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, the fact is that this is novel legislation and it is important that the House has as much time as necessary to ensure that every aspect is teased out so that it actually works.  The imposition of a guillotine is contrary to the best interests of this country and of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add to that. This morning there was a 15 page submission on the Competition Bill from the Incorporated Law Society, which is not a political organisation.  This is something we are expected to understand and have absorbed and debated by 10.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

      <P>The point I wish to make relates to item No. 12, the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1990.  The proposal is to guillotine this Bill at 12 noon today. There are 21 amendments to that fairly technical and controversial Bill.  Indeed, new amendments have just been circulated this morning.  I do not see how we can be reasonably expected to agree to a guillotine on this Bill at this time given that new amendments have been circulated.  As far as I can see it is, in any event, totally unnecessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On a procedural point, if the Opposition wish to express the reasons they wish to oppose the guillotine surely it is sensible that the Dáil should hear why the Members feel a guillotine is unwise in a certain situation.  It is a debate like any other debate and surely the Ministers and the Taoiseach want to hear the reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a procedural point, I am not arguing with you.  The point I am trying to make is that if you want to make a case not to impose a guillotine, surely it is only sensible that the Members on this side should have an opportunity to express their reasons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been abroad on important Government business and will be here to take the legislation.  The Opposition are continuously objecting to the allocation of time motions which we bring in.  We have to get on with our business here.  It is the Government's duty to order business, to get legislation through the House and we are criticised if we do not. In every parliament a certain amount of time is allocated for a particular piece of legislation.  That is the only way to get business done in a parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing that.  We believe that this Bill has been before the Oireachtas for plenty of time.  The time allocated now for the Committee and remaining Stages is ample and I do not really believe there is any reality in these complaints by the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be contentious about this but it is obvious that the Taoiseach does not understand what is involved here.  This is a Bill which will be adjudicated on by the High Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill specifically refers the legislation to the High Court.  It is most undesirable that it will be rushed through the House when there is ambiguity remaining in the Bill as is obvious from the 15 page submission received from the Incorporated Law Society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>May I simply make the point in response to what the Taoiseach has said in regard to the expedition procedure of Bills through this House, that we fully support that approach to dealing with Bills in this House.  However it is not adequate to say that and then to proceed to allow less than one-and-a-half hours for 21 amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  I want to raise two subjects, that one particularly arises because questions put down by my party on this issue were ruled out of order on the basis that the matter was <i>sub judice,</i> yet the Minister can refer to it on radio and in the newspapers.  Apparently the <i>sub judice</i> rule applies only to this House. I would certainly welcome an opportunity for the Minister to answer questions in the House today.</P>
      <P>May I also ask the Taoiseach when the Family Planning (Amendment) Bill will be brought before the House?  It has been promised on a number of occasions.  We have been told frequently that it will be produced quite soon, but still has not appeared.  It is urgent legislation on which I am sure many Deputies would agree to a guillotine if the Taoiseach would introduce it quickly.</P>

In view of the fact that a lecturer in economics said on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; this morning that waste is not an issue, may I ask the Taoiseach, before Dr. Byrne and Dr. Barrett go on their three months' holidays, if he will assure the House that, not subject to the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; or anybody else, but in line with the report of the Committee of Public Accounts, the legislation to improve and update the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts will be introduced in this session?

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`the Act of 1936' means the Courts of Justice Act, 1936;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>I also refer to amendments Nos. 3 and 4. These are purely drafting amendments that are desirable because of the frequency with which reference is made in the Bill to the Courts of Justice Act, 1936. They are technical amendments and I should be grateful if the House would accept them.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), lines 18 to 22, to delete the definitions of &ldquo;judge&rdquo; and &ldquo;justice&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo; `judge', where used without qualification, means a judge of the Supreme Court, a judge of the High Court, a <Col N="1553" /> judge of the Circuit Court or a judge of the District Court;&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>I move the amendment for the purposes of making a point about the status of the judges of the District Court. I propose that the definition of the word &ldquo;judge&rdquo; be extended to include judges of the District Court as well as judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Circuit Court.  As a consequence, I suggest that the definition of the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; be deleted entirely.</P>
    <P>I admit that if the Minister accepts the amendment various substantial consequential amendments would then have to follow.  I have not set out down to insert all of those as amendments, but if the point is made at this stage &mdash; and I recognise that there is no Report Stage &mdash; then the Minister and his Department could address the issue in legislation, perhaps not today but on some other occasion.</P>
    <P>Very briefly we should investigate the origins of the concept of &ldquo;justice&rdquo; as a title conferred on judges of the District Court.  They should be addressed in their proper term and in all legislation pertaining to them judges sitting in the District Court should be described simply as judges.  The term has come in some way to represent a reflection on their status and position.  I know that individual members of the District Court Judiciary are very concerned about the issue, some perhaps more than others.  It is in deference to them that I raise the point in the House this morning.  The Bill presents an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>The Constitution of 1937 refers to judges of all courts.  The concept of justice of the District Court does not arise in that document at all.  All judges, including those of the District Court, are appointed by the President under the Constitution and all judges of all courts are required to take the oath under that document.  The concept of calling a person who sits in the District Court as a judge something other than a judge simply does not arise.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Bill we will <Col N="1554" /> more closely consider the provisions of two of the grounding Acts of the Legislature, both of which were brought in in 1961 to re-establish the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  The first Act, the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act, 1961, very briefly established constitutionally the various courts in our administration.  It is interesting to note what is contained in section 5 in relation to the District Court.  Section 5 (1) states:</P>
    <P>a Court of First Instance, which shall be called An Chúirt Dúiche (The District Court), shall stand established. </P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The District Court shall be constituted of the following judges&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  a judge who shall be styled &ldquo;Uachtarán na Cúirte Dúiche&rdquo; (&ldquo;The President of the District Court&rdquo;), and</P>
    <P>(b)  such number of other judges (each of whom shall be styled &ldquo;Breitheamh den Chúirt Dúiche&rdquo; (&ldquo;Justice of the District Court&rdquo;)).  </P>
    <P>I am not a Gaelic scholar by any means, but I have asked those who do know the language much more fundamentally than I do about the direct and correct definition and interpretation of the word &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo;. I am sure the Minister of State, who I know as a Gaeilgeóir, would agree that it means &ldquo;judge&rdquo;.  For some odd reason we give it a different nomendature in the Legislature, and say &ldquo;justice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That may seem a small point, but it does cause irritation to members of the Judiciary sitting in District Court who would like to be, and who deserve to be, addressed in their proper title as &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo;, &ldquo;Judge&rdquo;.  I know that there is a long history going back to 1936 that those who sit in the District Court should be known in the English language as &ldquo;justice&rdquo;. I argue that they should be addressed as judges of the District Court, as many of us have addressed them over the years.</P>
    <P>That is my reason for moving the amendment.  It is not central to the issues of the Bill and I shall not dwell any further <Col N="1555" /> on it.  I acknowledge that there is no Report Stage, which I regret, and I acknowledge that many consequential amendments would be necessary, but I hope that at some stage the Department and the Minister will examine the issue and establish judges of all courts with the same status in name if not in other respects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to state that the specific purpose of the Bill &mdash; and I think Deputy McCartan acknowledges this &mdash; is to provide for certain limited changes to the superannuation entitlements of the Judiciary and certain court officers in line with similar changes introduced since 1970 to the superannuation courts for other groups within the Public Service.  While I am satisfied that the changes proposed in the Bill can be justified, I am not disposed to extend the scope of the legislation to provide for further significant improvements.  To do so would be clearly out of line with the need for severe restraint in all areas of public expenditure, including the Exchequer pay and pensions legislation.  That could lead to repercussive claims from other groups and would significantly alter the character of the legislation.  The proposed amendment would represent a step in the removal of the distinctions that have always existed between the pension provisions of the Supreme Court, High Court and Circuit Court judges on the one hand and district justices on the other hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Courts of Justice Act, 1924 provided that Supreme Court, High Court and Circuit Court judges would qualify for maximum pension on completion of 15 or more years' service.  For District Court justices the legislation provided that they would be pensionable under the superannuation Acts as are civil servants, that is, a maximum pension after 40 years' service.  Since then the only fundamental change in pension terms made for Supreme Court, High Court and Circuit Court judges was the requirement introduced in 1953 that to qualify for a <Col N="1556" /> pension in the normal course they must have attained the age of 65 years.</P>
    <P>For district justices, the basic position changed as follows: the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, introduced judicial type pension terms with maximum entitlement after 30 years service.  The Courts of Justice Act, 1953, reduced the qualifying period of service for maximum pension to 20 years and also applied the provision that a justice, like the other judges must have reached the age of 65 for pension in the normal course.  District justices would benefit considerably from the Bill as drafted including in particular from the proposal in section 2 to permit temporary service to reckon for pension purposes. This would enhance the pension of many justices.  It would also enable some who otherwise would not do so to qualify for full pension.  Accordingly, I do not propose to alter the situation.  To do so could lead to repercussive claims from other groups and would significantly alter the character of this legislation.  This is not intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has broadened the debate from what I intended.  I was simply seeking to address the general issue of the title and address to be given in legislation to people who sit as judges in the District Courts.  The Minister touched on a point which I will cover in further amendments where I seek to introduce equality in terms of the multiplier element of the pension rights of judges for the District Court.  In further sections we will talk about multipliers of one-twentieth, one-thirtieth and one-fortieth.  I suggest that they should all stand at one-twentieth for all judges.  In that regard the Gleeson Commission acknowledged that while the remuneration levels for judges should vary, depending on their status and the court level at which they sit, there should not be a differentiation with regard to pension rights.  They suggested that once a judge retires, they are all equal.  That is a good principle.  All judges should be treated equally when they have retired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Minister of State said there are issues of severe restraint on <Col N="1557" /> public expenses necessary.  We will come to that in more detail later in the Bill.  In equity, all judges should be dealt with on the same basis in retirement.  I do not accept the Minister's argument.</P>
    <P>An amendment just circulated by the Fine Gael Party has prompted me to say that it is good to put this legislation in place.  The pension position of judges should be put on a proper basis so that we do not have the unseemly rounds of representations, negotiations, discussions and cajolings which led to the introduction of this legislation so long ago in 1984, and why it has had such a chequered and controversial history. Now that we are putting in place a comprehensive basis for pensions, it is only right that we address this issue of the equality of judges on retirement.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to raise the issue, that we should abandon the term &ldquo;justice&rdquo; for judges of the District Court. They are judges under the Constitution. In the legislation somewhere along the way the concept of a &ldquo;justice&rdquo; was imported into the legislation on the English language side, for some odd reason.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House will agree that it is not appropriate in a Bill like this to consider matters relating to the status of persons to whom the Bill refers.  These are matters which may be raised with my Department.  We are talking about a very important amendment if we are to change the title or status of a person.  I have an open mind on it.  We could just look at our own position.  Some people would say that we are Deputies and more people would say we are TDs. It is a similar situation.  I cannot accept Deputy McCartan's suggestion here.  We can have consultations and perhaps on some other day we might be able to address the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister's assurance that this Bill does not confer any new benefits on judges.  Subsection (2) (a) says:</P>
      <P>references to the remuneration of a judge or justice shall be construed as references to the remuneration of the judge or justice at the time he vacates his office; </P>
      <P>I refer to the outrageous attack made on one judge in this Chamber, on Second Stage, I am deeply sorry that there are not more members of the press present so that somebody can defend a person who cannot defend himself.  I am referring to ex-Chief Justice Tom O'Higgins who is now serving us in a very senior capacity in the European Court in Luxembourg. Recently I visited the court in Luxembourg with other members of the EC Committee and I can say without fear of contradiction that Judge Tom O'Higgins and Judge Barrington are held in the highest esteem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is often said that Irish people do well abroad and it is great for this country to have so many talented people abroad to uphold our reputation.  We are fortunate to have in the courts in Luxembourg two judges who do just that.  They are held in great respect by their fellow judges and our reputation has increased as a result of their presence.  I very much regret the wild statements made by Deputy McCartan on Second Stage in relation to ex-Chief Justice Tom O'Higgins.  It must be the first time in the history of the House that a Minister for Justice did not find it possible to defend somebody who has served us so well and to contradict the total inaccuracy of the statements made by Deputy McCartan.  The Minister is present here this morning, but he was not present for Question Time and he does not turn up for Adjournment Debates.  I do not know where the Minister goes. For a Deputy from The Workers' Party <Col N="1559" /> to make such statements with no foundation is nothing short of a disgrace.</P>
    <P>What does Deputy McCartan mean by &ldquo;representing the workers&rdquo;?  I would remind Deputy McCartan that anyone who serves this country on the Bench is a worker who pays PAYE and does not receive any more benefit than any other civil servant.  On numerous occasions people talk about decisions made by various district justices, or judges of the Circuit Court or High Court.  They say that judges should have training, that we need better quality judges, that they do not like judges' decisions and that we will have to do something about it.  All this stuff is trotted out.  If you pay peanuts you will get monkeys.  Top civil servants in the commercial State sector or serving exceptionally in various Departments should be paid the top going rate.  The same applies to members of the Judiciary whom we expect to leave practices making substantial amounts of money. Deputy McCartan knows the sort of money one can make as a practising solicitor especially if you are involved in the free legal aid system.  From figures published recently it was quite obvious that Deputy McCartan's firm did very well, making in excess of £100,000 per annum.  It is nothing short of scandalous to criticise a member of the Judiciary who served this country at various levels up to Chief Justice and to make totally inaccurate statements giving the impression to the public that this person was involved in a rip-off because the Taoiseach gave a commitment to him.</P>
    <P>The four judges involved in this legislation deserve every single penny they are getting.  This legislation is the same as that relating to civil servants.  I should like the Minister to clarify a few points for me.  How did Deputy McCartan decide, in the case of Mr. Justice O'Higgins, that his income from his pension would be in excess of £30,000 per annum? In the Official Report of 18 April 1991, column 425, Deputy McCartan said in relation to the former Chief Justice, Mr. Thomas F. O'Higgins:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> ...he will benefit from a judicial pension approaching £30,000 per year &mdash; now it will be more because of increments in the meantime &mdash; this, backdated, as promised under the provisions of the legislation, will offer the recipient, the person central to this whole issue, something in the order of a minimum of £250,000 lump sum on his retirement.  That is what we are legislating for. </P>
    <P>The Deputy made that statement and the media reported it without checking the facts.  The Minister for Justice &mdash; I stress Justice &mdash; allowed those inaccurate statements without correcting them.</P>
    <P>I should like him to comment on the following.  In so far as it relates to Irish judges who have served &mdash; or are serving &mdash; on the nomination of the Irish Government at the Court of Justice of the European Communities, this Bill confers no new benefit or advantage.  Will the Minister confirm that this is so?</P>
    <P>Judicial pension rights for Irish judges accure, apart from incapacity or death, only on reaching the retirement age of 72 years for a High Court or Supreme Court judge.  Most civil servants retire at 60 or 65 years of age.  Will the Minister confirm that a judge who has 15 or more years' service on the Irish Bench may, at his option, take early retirement?  The third point I want to raise is vitally important. Since Ireland's accession to the EC in 1973 four Irish judges have been nominated by the Government to serve in the EC Court &mdash; since 1989 two EC Courts have been established, both situated in Luxembourg.  To take up these appointments, the judges had to retire from the Irish Bench before reaching normal retirement age.  The judges in question were Mr. Chief Justice Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh in 1973-74, Mr. Justice Andreas O'Keeffe, President of the High Court from 1974-84 and Mr. Justice Thomas F. O'Higgins, who served from 1984 and who is due to retire next October.  Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, High Court, was appointed to the new court of first instance established in 1989.</P>
    <P>I stress that this legislation is not being <Col N="1561" /> brought in for one judge.  Long before Mr. Justice O'Higgins received a commitment from any Taoiseach, commitments were given back in the seventies.  If someone in that position continued to serve they would have automatically got a pension without any of this fuss and bother and without banner headlines in the newspapers.  Because we wanted to send our best people to the EC they should not lose accrued pension rights for which they had already paid and to which they were entitled.</P>
    <P>Because there was a flaw in the legislation the Taoisigh of the day &mdash; rightly &mdash; decided to do something about it.  I refer to former Taoisigh Liam Cosgrave, Garret FitzGerald, and Jack Lynch and to the Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey.  If a senior civil servant in exactly the same position was offered a post in Europe and took it, because of legislative differences he would have automatically got his pension rights.  Because the legislation did not refer to members of the Judiciary, should we expect that somebody who served this country and who gave up very successful practices to serve on the Bench should forego his pension rights?  We must remember that all the money these people get will be taxed.  It is extraordinary that The Workers' Party attacked people who have paid for their pension rights and accrued them through years of service.  It is nothing short of cheap publicity.  The figures quoted were totally inaccurate and the Minister for Justice did not correct them.</P>
    <P>I will again quote from the Official Report of 18 April 1991, column 424 where Deputy McCartan quoted the Minister as follows:</P>
    <P>The Bill, which is broadly similar to one which was introduced in 1984 but which lapsed with the dissolution of the 24th Dáil, would honour a commitment made by the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, to a Member of the Judiciary who vacated office for the purpose of taking up a position with the European Communities. The commitment has since <Col N="1562" /> led to threats of legal action if not put in place. </P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice did not tell the Dáil that when Mr. Justice Andreas O'Keeffe the then President of the High Court, took up a position in Europe back in the seventies he got a commitment from the then Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, because he had only nine years' service in his position in the High Court at that time.  He was entitled to the benefit of those nine years, I am not complaining about that.  This was purely an attack on Mr. Justice Thomas O'Higgins and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald. It was nothing short of scandalous. I repeat, these commitments were given by former Taoisigh Liam Cosgrave, Jack Lynch and Garret FitzGerald and by the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey.</P>
    <P>I praise all four for giving them to honour the people concerned, irrespective of their political background, be they of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour Party persuasion.  They are honourable men and they served on the Bench in this country.  At the invitation of the Government they went to Europe to represent us in the European Court.</P>
    <P>These men have families and children and mortgages and have to make arrangements for their retirement just like everybody else.  If they have paid their contributions they are entitled to receive their pensions regardless of whether they are serving on the Bench or sitting in an office of any State Department. The day we start criticising those who work for the State and do not give them what they are duly entitled to will be a sad one.  I object to anyone using the occasion to look for cheap political gain and banner headlines which were totally and utterly inaccurate.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State is listening because there is one other point I want to make.  The reason the Bill makes no reference to the late Chief Justice Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh is that he had completed 15 years' service when he left to go to Luxembourg and was automatically entitled to receive a pension.  However, <Col N="1563" /> none of the other three judges had completed 15 years' service and continue to serve this country in the European Court. I ask the Minister of State to confirm that their service in the European Court will not be applicable for pension purposes under this legislation; in other words, this Bill will apply only to their service in the Irish courts.  I also ask the Minister of State to confirm that an undertaking was given to Mr. Justice Aindreas O'Keeffe &mdash; who had nine years service &mdash; when he went to Europe in 1974 that legislation would be passed to correct the anomaly already outlined.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm that a commitment was given to him that he would retain his pension rights.  I would further ask the Minister of State to confirm that the same commitment was given to former Chief Justice Tom O'Higgins and to Judge Barrington when they went to Europe.</P>
    <P>With regard to former Chief Justice Tom O'Higgins, who Deputy McCartan claimed was due a pension approaching £30,000 and a lump sum of £250,000 I would ask the Minister of State to confirm that in December 1984 when the Government gave a commitment to introduce the necessary legislation his pension was calculated at £16,028.95 which is a long way from £30,000.  Like all other civil servants, he was also entitled to receive a gratuity.  I would like the Minister of State to correct the information given out by Deputy McCartan the other day and to confirm that the former Chief Justice will not receive a pension of £30,000 and a lump sum of £250,000, that the legislation will apply to more than one judge and that commitments were given by others apart from Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  I want the Minister of State, who is an honourable person, to stand up and defend the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They should not, because of some quirk in legislation, lose any benefits which they are entitled to receive in <Col N="1564" /> respect of their period of service prior to taking up their new position abroad.  I would ask the Minister of State to confirm that they were no longer entitled to receive a pension once they left to go abroad.  Those are vitally important questions and our friends in the media would do democracy a great favour if they correct the inaccurate statements made by reporting the statements that the Minister of State will make, which the Minister, Deputy Burke, failed to make, and my request.</P>
      <P>I would like to say, on behalf of all on this side of the House, to each of those judges: &ldquo;Thank you for the service you have given to the country.  We will not take your political background into account, whether it be Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, as it is totally irrelevant.  You did us proud and you are entitled to the benefits accrued during your period of service on the Irish Bench&rdquo;.  I wish all four good luck.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do so having made my protest at the way the Chair has treated the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view the independence of the Judiciary is part of the bedrock of our democratic system.  In fact our Constitution requires very specifically that the remuneration and emoluments of the Judiciary will not be reduced during their term of office.  This was specifically put in by the framers of the Constitution as part of their commitment to the democratic system and their acknowledgment of the role the Judiciary play in a democratic society.  Unfortunately, begrudgery is one of our national characteristics and that is about the only characteristic that was displayed by the representative of The Workers' Party, Deputy McCartan, on Second Stage when he made such outlandish comments on this Bill.  He <Col N="1568" /> quoted wildly exaggerated figures &mdash; apparently for the sake of cheap publicity and engaged in what I believe can only be described as populist panderings for the sake of acquiring that publicity.</P>
    <P>That is an abuse of the procedures of this House and I join with my colleague, Deputy Barrett, in strongly condemning that abuse.  What is even worse is that like myself, Deputy McCartan is a member of the legal profession and should therefore understand the importance of honouring undertakings given.  Undertakings were given by various Taoisigh, the former Taoisigh Mr. Liam Cosgrave, Mr. Jack Lynch and Deputy Garret FitzGerald and by the present Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in relation to this matter.  In many ways undertakings are regarded in the legal profession as sacred, and in the same way I believe those undertakings should have been honoured without question.</P>
    <P>Apart from the four judges mentioned, the same applies to the position of Judge Gleeson, of which he should be aware as well and in relation to whose pension an undertaking was also given by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch.  To put the matter in proper perspective he is retired on a pension of £160 per week &mdash; partly because the undertaking given to him in relation to his services as chairman of the Employment Appeals Tribunal was not honoured and unfortunately so far it has not been honoured in this Bill.  I will be pressing this issue further if I get the opportunity later, but as I may not get an opportunity later I mention it now because I feel it is disgraceful that that undertaking was not honoured.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is deplorable that the allegations made by Deputy McCartan on Second Stage were not totally rebutted by the Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, said in his opening remarks and I quote: &ldquo;These particular matters have been the subject of representations to my Department from the Judiciary and the court officers over a period of years and previous administrations also have been committed to their implementation.&rdquo;  He was fully aware of the situation and yet when these <Col N="1569" /> wildly exaggerated statements were coming from Deputy McCartan, the Minister for Justice made no effort to rebut them, a disgraceful performance on his part.</P>
    <P>In case anyone wants to suggest or there is any residue of doubt that we on this side of the House are speaking on behalf of a particular judge who happened to have been a former Member of this House on behalf of our party, that is not so.  The original undertaking given in this House was given to Judge Andreas O'Keeffe &mdash; no relation, in fact a son-in-law of Eamon de Valera &mdash; in 1974 by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave. That man is retired seven years and he is still without the pension to which he is entitled.  It is absolutely essential that we put the record straight.</P>
    <P>I will conclude as I began.  I believe that Deputy Garret FitzGerald's name has been dragged before this House in such a fashion that entitles him to set the record straight and I ask that he, in particular be given that opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the debate has to conclude at 12 noon.  This had not our agreement and I would like to have had more opportunity to pursue these issues.  They do not take me by surprise. Deputy Barrett was not here the last day but in the interim he used whatever opportunity he could to let us know that he was not very pleased with what had been said on the day.</P>
      <P>I want to put the record straight on this issue.  The Workers' Party welcomed in general terms the provisions of the legislation and I do so today.  The idea of bringing the pension rights of the Judiciary into line with other people's entitlements is only proper, and I stated so on at least four occasions on the record of this House, which Deputy Barrett has so selectively quoted from this morning. I did not make Judge Tom O'Higgins the central character of this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in which pensions generally had been dealt with and the way his particular position was dealt with, and more particularly because the Government of which Deputy Barrett was a member, could do nothing with this legislation from 1984, when it was first introduced, to 1987 when he and the government went out of office.  He has not explained in this House today why for three years he, as a member of the Government of which Deputy Garrett FitzGerald was also a member, could do nothing with such an eminent and sensible piece of legislation which so late in the day they now say, as Deputy Cotter did and as Senator Manning said in the Seanad, should be nodded through without debate and discussion and without any amendment whatsoever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to hear the reason because I was not a member of the Dáil until 1987 and I would like to know why the Government of the day could do nothing with the legislation if it is so eminently sensible as has been suggested.  Deputy Barrett seems to hang his argument entirely on the suggestion that there is absolutely nothing in this legislation which gives to members of the Judiciary &mdash; there are 24 and not four as he has suggested &mdash; particular rights that exist only for senior member of the Civil Service elsewhere.  That is correct except in one fundamental and important provision, that is, in respect of the retrospective provisions in this legislation.  In no other pension scheme or other legislation, including the Pensions Bill which was debated in this House last year was any provision in regard to retrospection provided for any member of the Civil Service.  Those whose positions were corrected and improved got no benefit by way of retroactive provision, and that is the one single criticism that our party have levelled against the legislation in <Col N="1571" /> principle, and it is the one of ten we have sought to amend in the legislation but we have not been allowed to debate our amendment.  I note there is no other amendment from the Fine Gael Party or from the Labour Party, the Coalition partners who promoted this legislation in the first instance, beyond a latter day amendment that was circulated this morning addressing another outrageous neglect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The retrospective provisions are the fundamental part of the legislation.  No other legislation in this House has provided such facility to people in the public service.  That is the difference.  There was a precedent in 1968 when the late Mr. Justice Fitzgerald was provided for in legislation which makes <Col N="1574" /> this House a laughing stock.  Section 1 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Act states that the period from 6 October 1966 to 26 March 1978, a period of about eleven and a half years, should be 15 years for the purposes of the then Chief Justice so that he could get his full pension.  That is the kind of precedent being foisted on us.  The Workers' Party have difficulty about the retrospective element of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The former Tánaiste, Deputy Lenihan, described the legislation in 1984 as an act of insanity.  The current Minister for Justice who is promoting this legislation was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> in October 1990 as describing the actions of Mr. Justice O'Higgins as holding the Government to ransom in demanding payment of retrospective pension rights.  In those contexts I make no apology for seeking to establish some facts and detail.  I have asked the same questions as Deputy Barrett. I was also disappointed that the Minister with responsibility did not provide the information.</P>
      <P>A guillotine has been placed on this Committee Stage debate and there is no opportunity for Report Stage, yet the full implications of this legislation have not been stated.  In principle, retrospection of pensions is wrong in this instance and it has never been provided in any other instance.  It is wrong that we are being asked to legislate without the full facts in terms of the cost to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I wish to defend myself against the implications of the Minister for Justice and the allegations of Deputy McCartan.  I came into politics 26 years ago on a principle which I intended to adhere to throughout my political life, that no relative or friend of mine would ever benefit in any way by virtue of my holding public office.  I have held to that principle and I deeply resent the allegations made against me which <Col N="1575" /> were encouraged by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice in introducing the debate in the Seanad put this legislation down to a commitment made by me to a member of the Judiciary in 1984. I entered into no fresh commitment in this matter.  As the Minister knew and did not disclose there or in this House, that commitment was entered into by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Cosgrave, when Mr. Cearbhall O Dálaigh became President and had to be replaced in the European Court.  Mr. Justice O'Keeffe did not have the necessary pensionable service and could not easily take up the post, which involved giving up potential rights.  Mr. Justice O'Keeffe had been a Fianna Fáil Attorney General and there was no political involvement of any kind.  The then Taoiseach, Mr. Cosgrave, entered into a commitment to introduce this legislation so that Mr. Justice O'Keeffe's position would be protected.  Mr. Justice O'Keeffe is now many years retired and has not touched one penny of that pension. For that a number of us are to blame, myself included, in that I did not get the legislation through.  I feel a sense of shame at having failed to get it through.</P>
      <P>I entered into no fresh commitment. Mr. Justice O'Higgins asked me at the time if that commitment would be honoured and I said yes of course I would honour the commitment given by my predecessor as Taoiseach.  It was also entered into by Mr. Lynch as Taoiseach. The suggestion that I entered into any fresh commitment is unfounded and the allegations repeatedly made by Deputy McCartan that I was involved in cosy discussions with a friend, that cajoling pressures were brought to bear and that the arrangement was a personal one with the Government involved, are totally unfounded.</P>

The Minister for Justice knew that and when he came to reply to the debate he did not disclose the fact that the commitment had been entered into in respect of the former Fianna Fáil Attorney General, Mr. Justice O'Keeffe, but allowed those slurs to remain on the record, as he did on a television programme at the end of last year.  I reject these accusations.  The only action I took was to confirm that we would introduce the legislation.  I failed to do so and I am ashamed of that.  I apologise here to Mr. Justice O'Keeffe for the fact that he has been deprived of what he is entitled to and was promised by successive Governments. I bear part of the blame, as do other Taoisigh of the period.  I have no apology to make to the Minister for Justice who set out to traduce me in this House by his deliberate omission of the truth.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in section 5 of the Bill will benefit those persons mentioned by Deputy Barrett but they will benefit many other people also.  They will also benefit persons who retired without right to pension. Approximately 30 judges will benefit from arrears under the provisions of the Bill.  One reference has been made to Mr. Justice Gleeson.  Mr. Justice <Col N="1577" /> Gleeson's pension will be increased from approximately £160 per week at the moment to something in excess of £240 as a result of this Bill being passed.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to re-open this debate but I want to repeat what I said this morning about the manner in which the Minister is handling this Bill. There is absolutely no necessity for the way he is pushing this important, complex and complicated legislation through the House.  As I said this morning, I received a 15 page submission this morning &mdash; I presume every other Deputy received it also &mdash; from the Incorporated Law Society.  The Minister is doing no service to this House and he is doing no service to this Bill which he says is important.  If it is that important then it deserves far more consideration than pushing it through the House at the speed at which he is proceeding.</P>
      <P>I want to give him notice now that I will not agree to a rushed Report Stage. There is no necessity for what the Minister is doing.  I cannot understand what prompted him to do it.  He sat on the Fair Trade Commission report for 15 months without publishing it; he then published the report and the Bill at the same time. He had no consultations with anybody prior to that.  I presume Deputy Taylor and Deputy Rabbitte have not had any opportunity to discuss the fine points of this Bill.  The Minister is doing no service to democracy, to this House, to his own reputation or to the Bill because of the manner in which he is handling it.</P>

      <P>I fully endorse in every respect the comments made by Deputy <Col N="1580" /> Barry.  The reason for this unseemly pressure is inexplicable.  I heard the Minister say on radio that this Bill would make some major impact into the unemployment situation and that it would be a major factor in the economy.  That does not stand up.  The Bill is of some importance and we should get it through obviously as quickly as we can, but that does not mean the guillotine should be applied as ruthlessly as in this instance.  It is not good enough that this lengthy, complex measure be disposed of within the few remaining hours of today and there is no need for it.  If there was pressure or a need for it one could understand.  If the Minister thinks this Bill will make any major inroads on the 250,000 people who are unemployed I fear he will be sadly mistaken.</P>

      <P>I agree with the comments made by Deputies Barry and Taylor.  I made the same points on the last occasion.  We have all been in receipt of last minute submissions from interested parties.  It is a complex issue, as the Minister agrees.  I am not sure whether its impact will be of the magnitude he suggested on the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; programme last Sunday.  It would have been appropriate that on a matter as important as this we, the Opposition, would have had an opportunity to consider the views of various interested parties irrespective of to what degree we wanted to take them on board.  As I commented on the last occasion, it is especially regrettable in the context of the report published by the Fair Trade Commission that this House only became aware of the fact that the report was available on the same day as the Minister introduced the Bill.</P>

      <P>It was presented to the House on 12 April 1991, that is two months ago.  It is not a particularly long Bill.  Some of the concepts involved are different in as much as they are not the normal English common law which we are used to dealing with but they certainly are not novel because the European Community has had them on board for the past 30 odd years.  It has been before the House for two months.  People have had ample opportunity to study it.  I do not want a repeat of the situation we had in regard to the Companies (No. 2) Bill which went on for three and a half years before it was finally passed.</P>
      <P>There is an urgency about this matter, and I am anxious to have the Bill enacted before the summer recess.  The Bill also has to go to the Seanad.  I do not agree that there has been any undue haste in putting the Bill through this House.  It has taken the normal course so far.

I am not familiar with the details of that Bill but this is difficult and complex legislation. The Company and Commercial Law Committee of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland have had the Bill since it was published and will have devoted far more time to it than this House.  That committee comprises lawyers, all of whom are capable of understanding the complexities involved.  They took until this morning to make their second submission on the Bill.  Yet the Minister expects the Opposition parties, who do not have the expert back-up facilities that are available to him and the Incorporated Law Society, to deal with the Bill in the same manner as that committee.  This is <Col N="1582" /> totally unreasonable and undemocratic and the Minister is doing himself no good in this respect.  The Minister is getting the reputation of being uncaring and intolerant &mdash; he is not willing to give interviews, will not allow people to make submissions to him and will not listen.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (3) (a), line 1, to delete &ldquo;A licence&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;An exemption&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment.  The Minister has repeatedly said that he wants this Bill to represent as closely as possible what is happening in the European Community. What is happening there is that the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; is used.  Yet apart from one section, and the Minister has put down an amendment to change that, the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; is used throughout the Bill.  If it is the Minister's intention to follow as closely as possible what is happening in Europe, why has he not used the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; which has a different meaning to the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo;?  A person has to apply for a licence to do something while the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; means that the Bill does not apply to a person's activities.  The Minister has not explained satisfactorily why he uses the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; and not &ldquo;exemption&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; was carefully chosen by the draftsman after <Col N="1583" /> considerable consideration.  In an ideal world it could be argued that the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; might be preferable. However, the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; fits, from an administrative and legal perspective, the activities of the Authority.  It is used to emphasise that the powers of the Authority are administrative as distinct from judicial.  It helps to dispel doubt about any constitutional criticism of the character of the Authority's decisions, and for that reason I would not propose to change it.  Licence and exemption do not mean totally different things, as suggested by Deputy Barry.  A licence gives a person permission to do something which he would not otherwise be empowered or allowed to do.  In administrative and legal terms, it has largely the same meaning as the word &ldquo;exemption.&rdquo;  It emphasises the administrative aspect of the Authority's powers as opposed to judicial powers.</P>

I have not had a chance to read their submission but I do not think they make a major issue of this. They refer to both block exemptions and licences.  Needless to say, I do not accept what the Minister has said.  If people are going to use this Bill to take cases to the High Court and the High Court will look at case law in Europe, which I think is the Minister's intention, then the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; would be more appropriate than the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo;.</P>

I take it that their advertence to the fact that the Fair Trade Commission's report advocated that the block exemptions applicable in Europe would automatically apply to Irish law is not acceptable to the Minister.  I should like the Minister to say why he has decided that those block exemptions which are well established under European law ought not to apply automatically in the Irish case but that presumably application <Col N="1584" /> will have to be made in each individual case.</P>

It proposes that notice of a decision to grant or refuse an individual exemption under <Col N="1585" /> subsection (2) shall be given by the Authority within two months of being notified by an undertaking or association of undertakings under section 7.  With the consent of the parties concerned this period may be extended by a further month.  The purpose of this amendment is quite clear &mdash; it seeks to ensure that the position which obtains in relation to decisions by An Bord Pleanála should not obtain in relation to decisions by the Competition Authority.  The delays by An Bord Pleanála in adjudicating on applications for planning permission have caused much frustration to people who want to modify or extend their premises, etc.  We should not allow the same situation to arise in regard to decisions by the Competition Authority.  When an application is made for a licence, to use the Minister's word, the Authority should be so organised that they can give a response within two months.  As I propose in my amendment, in cases where there is an agreement between the applicant and the Authority that period could be extended but in any event they should be under pressure to give a decision within two months from the making of the application.</P>

      <P>As I have said, only one amendment can be before the House at any given time, that is, Deputy Peter Barry's amendment No. 18. Deputy Mervyn Taylor may speak to his <Col N="1586" /> amendment No. 23 but he may not move it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The purport of my amendment is similar to the purport of Deputy Barry's amendment.  It is important that when these applications are made to the Authority there should be no prolonged delays by the Authority in coming to a decision.  If there were such delays it could be damaging to business and employment, it could create uncertainty in the marketplace and could lead to all sorts of business difficulties in the industries concerned.  Speed is important in all these issues but that is not to say that the authorities should not be given a reasonable length of time to carry out the necessary investigations on every application for a licence or a certificate.  It is unfortunate to have to say this, but it is true nonetheless that many adjudicating bodies that give quasi-judicial decisions such as this would be all too often a delay in giving attention to these matters, thus creating all kinds of problems.</P>
      <P>An Bord Pleanála, the planning appeals board, was one such board.  Local authorities became notorious for delays in dealing with planning applications. The position became so bad that the Oireachtas found itself compelled to change the law to bring in a maximum adjudication period of two months and to provide that if a planning application was not adjudicated upon within the two month period the application would be deemed to be granted.  The reason for that is clear enough.  I fear, as quite clearly does Deputy Barry, that this Authority might get into the same bad habit of letting an application which is put before them for a licence sit for month after month, causing havoc in the marketplace.  The unfortunate applicants would find there is nothing they could do when no decision is forthcoming on the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry suggested a period of two months as being a reasonable period, but I believe he was a little short on that. I appreciate that such an application is important, that proper inquiries must be carried out and thought given to each <Col N="1587" /> application.  I came to the conclusion that three months would be a reasonable period and that we should provide that the decision must be made within a three month period.  Such a provision in the Bill would focus the minds of the Authority. If they knew they were working under a time limit it would ensure that they applied themselves to the task entrusted to them under the Bill and that they produced their decision within the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>There is one other important distinction between Deputy Barry's amendment No. 18 and my amendment No. 23.  In Deputy Barry's amendment he provides that if the decision is not given within the appropriate period the application, exemption, licence or certificate, would be deemed to be granted.  I am providing for the reverse, that if the decision is not given within the time limit the application would be deemed to be refused.  As the Minister quite rightly pointed out the last day, what is being sought in an application for a licence or a certificate is a derogation from the law. An undertaking or a company seek permission to do something which otherwise would not be lawful, in other words, to break the law, to derogate from the general law that would apply to everybody else.  That being so, I felt it would not be right or proper that in the event of the failure of the Authority to give their decision within a particular time, that right to derogate would be given.  The correct procedure to adopt in that case would be to refuse the application.</P>

      <P>I support the thrust of both amendments.  Which amendment is the more appropriate depends on the content of the Minister's reply.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to contribute to economic growth in the economy and to realise the expectations the Minister has for it, but an open-ended permission as provided for in the sections as they stand could operate against business. There would be a reasonable expectation of the matter being cleared over a period of time, whether it be two or three <Col N="1588" /> months.  As I said, we will await the Minister's reply before deciding which amendment is the more appropriate one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Time limits for particular actions by the Authority in relation to notifications should not be imposed by the Bill because it would be too inflexible.  The system envisaged by the Bill is new to Ireland and needs a chance to operate flexibly.  The Authority will be able to make arrangements in relation to time limits and, where necessary, this can be done by the making of a ministerial regulation.  It would be best that this be done on the basis of practical experience rather than to do so rigidly in the Bill in advance of any experience under the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 18 and 20 propose a deadline system that would be dangerous. Automatic licences or certificates should not be available just because an artificial deadline has passed.  While every effort will be made by the Authority to deal with notifications as speedily as possible it is impossible to guarantee that any particular predetermined deadline will be observed in every case, particularly in a very complicated case. Incidentally, the term &ldquo;certificate&rdquo;, just like the term &ldquo;licence&rdquo;, is being used to distinguish the administrative nature of the Authority's decisions.  &ldquo;Negative clearance&rdquo;, although a well-known concept at European Community level, are words not found in the Treaty.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 23 in Deputy Taylor's name is the direct opposite of amendments Nos. 18 and 20 in Deputy Barry's name.  It would result in an automatic refusal if a deadline is not observed.  The approach of automatic granting of a licence if a deadline is passed is too lenient and correspondingly the suggestion of automatic rejection on the passing of a deadline is too harsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I failed in my earlier contribution to refer to the last few lines of my amendment.  My proposal to have a licence granted automatically if the deadline is not met is the opposite point of view to Deputy Taylor's proposal.  I do <Col N="1589" /> not agree with Deputy Taylor's suggestion that there be automatic refusal if the deadline is passed.  That would be most unfair because it could be used by the Authority as a means of not explaining their decision and by doing nothing the licence would be refused automatically.</P>
      <P>I would come back to the point I made a number of times on this Bill.  This Bill is causing concern not just among small businesses but to all sections of industry, and the Minister knows this from the number of submissions he has received from the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Small Business Association, RGDATA, trade associations and the Incorporated Law Society.  I do not recall in my time as Minister receiving so many submissions on any legislation I had to deal with.  An extraordinary number of submissions of a very detailed, complex and comprehensive nature are being made in this case.  The purpose of my amendment, and the Minister should adopt it for this reason alone, is to reassure people who are concerned about the costs that will be imposed upon them through the legislation.</P>
      <P>I did not hear the Minister's broadcast on Sunday, but he suggested that the Bill would aid job creation.  That is engaging in flights of fancy.  The Bill will do nothing to create jobs, and unless the Minister agrees to a minimus regulation it might have quite the reverse effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small firms cannot avail of the range of barristers and accountants that big multinational firms use to help them sort out and fill in the paperwork necessary to apply for an exemption under the Bill. Small firms are extremely concerned about the effects of the Bill.  My amendment tells them they need not be worried about long delays or about bureaucracy taking control of their business.  Many small firms, and big firms as well, are worred about the level of bureaucracy in Ireland.  Already we are at a considerable disadvantage in Europe because of our location and now the Minister intends to add more layers of paper filling to businesses which are already at a disadvantage because of their size and their small home market.  The Bill is trying to <Col N="1590" /> add more costs and I am trying to tell businesses that the Authority will work efficiently and make decisions promptly.</P>
    <P>To ensure prompt decisions the amendment requires the Authority to give a decision within two months.  The Minister said my amendment is inflexible. It is not.  The amendment states that with the consent of the parties concerned the period may be extended for a further month.  That is room for flexibility there &mdash; I am not hung up about whether the time limit would be two months or three months or whether and extension would be granted for one month or two months. The amendment is designed to give firms confidence that they will not find themselves caught in a bureaucratic jungle for a year or 18 months while waiting on a decision whether an exemption will be granted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's response to both amendments and found him to be unconvincing in the extreme. Surely the Minister must recognise that in the realm of business certainty and knowledge of the work arrangements for an industry must be of the utmost importance. The worst enemy of business and industry is uncertainty, and that is just what the Minister leaves open in the section as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue is not one of the Authority being too lenient or two harsh.  The worst possible position that firm making an application could find itself in would be to have to wait for months after submitting an application without knowing when a decision could be expected.  A firm making application and experiencing delays could ring the authority to make inquiries about the position but might well be told that the Authority do not know, that it is working on a decision. The firm would be hamstrung.  It is all very well for the Minister to tell the House that the Authority will do its best. I do not know whether they will, but one has to consider the experience of comparable authorities that have the job of making decisions on important matters. That experience is not a happy one. Indeed, even in the courts &mdash; never mind <Col N="1591" /> quasi-judicial authorities, even judicial authorities &mdash; cases are heard and long delays occur in giving decisions.  There are examples even in the Supreme Court, regrettably, of the courts hearing cases and then inexplicably holding up the giving of a decision for long periods.  I know of some cases in which the giving of a decision was delayed by more than two years.</P>
    <P>Quasi-judicial authorities, such as this Authority are open to such abuse.  If there is no constraint put on them to get on with the job and to apply themselves, they will be under no pressure and if it is not convenient for them to sit one day then an application could easily to put off until another time.  In the meantime, businesses, companies and employees would be sweating; waiting daily for a decision.  Without a limit on time the Authority would not be pushed and the people could just sit in their offices, bring up a file and have a cup of tea and there would be no great pressure or urgency. That is not good enough and it is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to say that the period of two months was too short but three months was too long and suggested a different time limit we could consider that, but it is not good enough to leave the measure at the discretion of an appointed authority in the sure and certain knowledge that they will be under no pressure to give a decision.  I am sure that many applicants would rather have an application refused than be left dangling and not knowing one way or the other.  It is possible that even a refusal would be better than the uncertainty involved in waiting indefinitely for a decision to be made.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is structured an undertaking makes application to the Authority.  It is a kind of <i>ex parte</i> arrangement, a one-sided application.  At that stage nobody is making objections to it.  My amendment tries to remedy that position, but that is a separate matter.  How could the Minister justify an unnecessarily extended period for the Authority to give its decision?  All that the Authority have before them is <Col N="1592" /> an application.  They read it, discuss it and give their decision.  For the life of me I do not understand how that could possibly take longer than three months. If the Minister were to say that a maximum of four months were necessary, so be it; I should be prepared to listen to that.  Why give the Authority the luxury that most of us do not have of a completely unspecified period of time within which to apply themselves to the documentation and make a decision on an application?</P>
    <P>I shall not say any more on the other point of difference, be it the granting of or the refusal of an application; I think that either would be preferable to doing nothing.  I still consider my own preference to be better, having regard to the fact that it is a derogation from the law that is at issue and that a derogation from the law, possibly of major benefit, should not be granted by default, as it were.  For that reason a refusal would be safer.  In my view, however, Deputy Barry's amendment would still be better than nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbite Mr. Rabbite">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbite</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asks us to be flexible at the beginning and to allow the legislation a period of time to work. I should have thought that it was at the beginning that we would need to enshrine certainty because it is at the beginning of the operation of the legislation that the questions posed by the amendments will focus most sharply.  After that small businesses will have an opportunity to consider the record and the past pattern and they will be able to make a reasonable guess at the likely outcome of an application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the representations that have been made to us relate to the questions of certainty and clarity.  People are not quite sure whether they should make an application or keep their heads down. That is the kind of query the Minister may consider to be very uninformed, but that is what I have been hearing for some representations made to me.  If people are to get expert advice that they must make application &mdash; as it seems to me in <Col N="1593" /> the cases envisaged here &mdash; it is imperative at the beginning that they be able to know that a decision will be made in two months, three months, four months, or whatever the reasonable cut-off time is to be.  They need to be able to plan their businesses with certainty in the expectation of receiving the presumed derogation.</P>
    <P>I am certain that businesses would prefer Deputy Barry's amendment which requires that if they do not hear within a specified period that the licence is granted that would be the end of waiting.  That is not to comment on perhaps more important questions raised by Deputy Taylor's approach, which is to say that a derogation is not forthcoming.  Businesses would certainly prefer that.  Quite clearly they cannot function in an environment where they do not know what the outcome will be.  The planning area, for example, is remarkable in the operation of the local authorities, where we are all accustomed to how local authorities can let important decisions drag on seemingly for ever, but because the planning laws are framed in the way they are, they simply must deal with planning applications within a specified period, or if they do not they know the alternative. Similarly, rather than helping business, the absence of any deadline will impede business.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider.  Simply appealing to the House to allow the Act a period of time to operate, will be cold comfort to the many small businesses who have no experience in this situation and who will be concerned to know that at least if they seek advise from business organisations, they can advise them with certainty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of points of a general nature were made.  They are really a re-hash of what was said the last day and already this morning.  I will deal briefly with them as a matter of courtesy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as these time limits are concerned, if necessary, they can be made by ministerial order under section 7 (6). The imposition of time limits in an Act would be far too inflexible because if they proved inappropriate or unsuitable they <Col N="1594" /> could only be changed by legislation.  We all know that time elapses between a decision to produce legislation and its ultimate drafting and enactment.  It could be a number of years.  That would be unreasonable.  The fact that time limits can be prescribed by the Authority or the Minister is perfectly adequate.  It is unfair of Deputy Taylor to imply that the Authority and their staff will neglect their duties in the way he has suggested.  That is not so.  The body concerned have always been assiduous in trying to do things quickly and I see no reason why they will not continue to do so particularly now that they have this additional duty and additional staff and powers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor makes the point that there should not be prolonged delays.  It must be remembered that in an application of this kind the parties involved can contribute to delays by failing to respond in a reasonable time to requests for clarification or supplementary information. If there was an automatic granting of a licence or an exemption after a particular period, if the parties who applied contributed to the inability of the Authority to make a decision in the time limit by virtue of their refusal to co-operate, it would be crazy to grant a licence or an exemption in circumstances where people might possibly not be entitled to one at all.  On reflection Deputies will agree that that would be entirely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>In a very edited version of an interview which I gave last Sunday and which was broadcast I referred to the effect that this Bill will have on the economy generally. That includes employment, but not specifically employment.  Since this point was raised by everyone who spoke it is worth repeating what I said on Second Stage, that the stimulus provided by competition has been shown to have a very beneficial effect on the economy of countries who have strong competition laws. It is no coincidence that it is countries like Germany and the US who go to some lengths in their laws, and have for a long time, to encourage competition and to discourage restrictive practices and other concerted practices of that kind, that are <Col N="1595" /> endemic to certain aspects of the Irish economy, who are amongst the most successful economies in the world and have been for a long time, and have been for so long as they encouraged competition in this way.  Therefore, it is quite justifiable to say that the provisions of this Bill will have an effect on the economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry referred at length to small businesses being very worried and concerned and implied that very small business would be affected in some way by this Bill.  This Bill can affect businesses only if they come within either of two categories or within both categories.  If they are involved in anti-competition agreement or concerted practices they will be affected.  The vast majority of businesses both small and big in this country are not involved and therefore they cannot be affected.  If they have a dominant position in a market sector and they abuse it, they can also be affected by this Bill.  The vast majority of businesses here, at least 99 per cent of them, do not have a dominant position in any market. Therefore they cannot abuse it and the Bill cannot apply to them.  It is an exaggeration to say that every proprietor of every corner shop in the country is trembling in his shoes at what might happen on the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry makes great play of the fact that the Incorporated Law Society made two submissions in regard to this Bill.  Deputy Barry may not know that the Incorporated Law Society comment on every Bill that is of any legal interest to or that impinges in any way on solicitors. They do so in the kind of technical detail that is in this submission.  In their supplementary submission they said they were pleased to note that the Minister had accepted a number of their recommendations and they went on to deal for a second time with a number of other recommendations they made in early May which already had been discussed in detail with them by officials of my Department.  There is nothing unusual about that.  They were met in the same way as they are met on every Bill.  It is always their practice to make these kinds <Col N="1596" /> of technical submissions from the point of view of solicitors.  It is useful that they do.  It is of benefit to my Department to meet them and to exchange views.  We agree with them on certain matters and point out where we believe they are wrong in other matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that I am exaggerating when I say that small businesses are concerned about the effects of this legislation.  I am not.  They are concerned.  The Minister says the vast majority of small business will not be affected.  I know that and the Minister knows that but they do not, because the Minister said that this is very important legislation which will change the face of Irish industry.  They are concerned.  They feel they will always have to consult this legislation and that they will have to consult accountants to know whether they are affected by the Bill.</P>
      <P>That is why they are afraid.  He said it will not apply to the vast majority, which is true.  He also said that 99 per cent of the balance will not be affected because they will not be in a dominant position in abusing it.  That is also true but, if that is the case, this very important legislation will not have the wide-ranging effect on the economy which he claims at the same time.</P>
      <P>I cannot imagine that what the Minister said about the Incorporated Law Society is correct, that they make submissions to all Departments on the technical aspects of every Bill introduced.  However, those of us who are not lawyers need time to understand whether they are making valid points and we cannot do that if the Minister insists on rushing this difficult &mdash; as far as I am concerned &mdash; legislation through the House.  I am expected to absorb, understand and make a judgment on the submission of the Incorporated Law Society within two hours of getting it.  It arrived this morning in the post and the resumed Committee Stage of this Bill commenced at 12 o'clock today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that time constraints are not desirable.  On reflection, perhaps he will agree that they are desirable because people affected by this legislation do not want to wait.  He said they could use this waiting period to make sure they get the exemption licence because they would refuse to respond to queries from the Authorities.  That implies the same kind of criticism of business communities which he has already accused Deputy Taylor of applying to the Authority.  That is unfair because business people are not engaged in a kind of one-up-manship against the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Competition Authority or any other authority. They are there to invest their shareholders' funds, to achieve targets in relation to growth and to give employment &mdash; in that order &mdash; because you cannot have the third without the first two.  To suggest that they will deliberately try to use the law to evade their responsibilities is not true; they would not waste their time in that kind of playacting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsection.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  (a)  Any agreement between undertakings, decision by association of undertakings or concerted practice that is within an EC block exemption will be exempt from the provisions in section 4 (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  Any agreement between undertakings, decision by an association of undertakings or concerted practice that would benefit from the provision of an EC block exemption but which does not do simply because it does not <Col N="1598" /> affect trade between member states of the EC will also be exempt from the provisions in section 4 (1).</P>
    <P>(c)  Any agreement or concerted practice between undertakings in the same group of companies is exempt from the prohibition of section 4 (1) in so far as the undertakings within the group do not enjoy real freedom to determine their individual course of action in the market.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This is an important and substantive amendment which I hope the Minister will accept.  I gather from what the Minister said that subparagraph (a) was one of the points made by the Incorporated Law Society.  It makes eminent sense to put it from a legal or business point of view and page 3 of the Incorporated Law Society's second submission 3.3 states:</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that agreements which conform with EEC block exemption regulations are unlikely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the State, the inclusion of such automatic licensing provisions in the Bill would eliminate any uncertainty as to the legal status of such agreements.  At present, the position under EEC competition law appears to be that an agreement which has been exempted by the EEC Commission, either individually or by means of block exemption regulation, can be prohibited under national competition law only to the extent that such prohibition does not interfere with the uniform application of EEC competition law throughout the Community.  <i>See:</i> Case 14/68: Walt Wilhelm <i>v</i> Bundeskartellamt (1969)...  The EEC Commission's interpretation of this case law is that it means in effect, that such agreements may not be prohibited under national competition law... The Committee believes that the Commission's interpretation may well be correct and that any doubts in this regard should be eliminated by including a specific provision to this effect in the Bill.  Otherwise, parties to agreements which have been exempted by the EEC Commission will also have <Col N="1599" /> to seek licences from the Competition Authority, with all the additional time and expense which that will involve. If the Competition Authority were to refuse to licence such an agreement and the parties appealed to the High Court, it is very likely that the matter would have to be referred to the European Court of Justice for a ruling under Article 177 of the EEC Treaty, with all the further expense and delay which that would involve.  Quite apart from the point of principle involved, the Committee believes that for these administrative reasons, it is desirable that this question be clearly resolved in the Bill. </P>
    <P>That makes the point much better than I could.  It is quite clear that it would save companies having to jump two hurdles, with all the expense involved.  If the Competition Authority refused such an exemption then the people who were refused would have to go to the High Court which would probably refer it to the European Court, involving enormous expense.  It would be a legal obstacle race to get a result, which is almost inevitable at this stage, and should be put beyond doubt by incorporating it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) refers to EC block exemption and paragraph (c) takes account of the fact that there may be a parent company.  A big conglomerate may well have two or three companies in this jurisdiction and the Authority might decide that they were abusing their dominant position in this market.  However, the companies concerned might not agree to stop abusing their dominant position because they may be under the control of a board or company in London, Paris or Brussels.  Therefore, they may not be free to stop abusing their dominant position.</P>
    <P>This amendment is extremely important and I hope the Minister will take it on board.  Companies who already have exemptions in Europe should not be forced to apply again here; companies which fulfil all the requirements for an exemption in Europe but who are not <Col N="1600" /> engaged in trade with inter-member states should not be required to apply for an exemption here as well.  Companies who are trading here, who may have a dominant position and who may, in the opinion of the Authority, abuse the dominant position, may not be doing so because the parent company are imposing the conditions of trade on them. In that case, the parent company should be taken before the European Community if it is outside the country.  Of course if they are in this country the same problem will not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment put down by Deputy Barry.  These amendments take account of the fact that businesses will be subject to more red tape and bureaucracy following the enactment of this legislation and in an effort to cut through some of this we suggest that those companies who have already received an exemption from the European Community should not have to seek an exemption under this legislation. I am disappointed with the Minister's statement that many businesses will not be affected by this legislation. However he has contributed to the uncertainty in regard to agreements, decisions on concerted practices, by failing to define in section 4 what practices will be outlawed.  He has even failed to define &ldquo;distorted competition&rdquo;.  As a result the section will be open to interpretation in the courts and many cases will find their way to the European Court of Justice who will bring our legislation into line by way of guidelines imposed on us.</P>
      <P>Given that there are sufficient examples of anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant position, the Minister should let the House know what guidelines he will give to the courts who will interpret this section.  This amendment provides for the exemption from the provisions of this section of any agreement, decision or concerted practice that is already exempted by the EC.</P>

      <P>Paragraphs (a) and (b) of amendment No. 19 would have the <Col N="1601" /> effect of exempting, without any examination, potentially anti-competitive practices and agreements within the State.  This Bill will not change the effect of European Community exemptions whether acquired as a result of individual applications or benefiting from a block exemption.  While the benefit of an exemption at Community level could be justified, that might not be the case within this State.  That must be obvious.  The Authority will have to decide in the context of market conditions in Ireland and not elsewhere what exemptions should be granted.</P>
      <P>There is a perceived difficulty in relation to agreements between companies in the same group which paragraph (c) of the amendment seeks to address.  Subsidiaries are subject to the control of parents but are considered to be separate undertakings by virtue of the definition in section 3.  At European Community level a group as a whole is generally considered to be an undertaking. However it is not proposed to make such a change in the definition. First, section 4 (1) prohibits all agreements and concerted practices between undertakings &ldquo;which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition.&rdquo;  I wish to repeat that it does not prohibit all agreements. Second, where a parent instructs a subsidiary to act in a particular fashion that does not constitute an agreement but rather a decision.  Section 4 applies to decisions of associations of undertakings and not to decisions of individual undertakings. If there is any difficulty the Authority will have the possibility of making decisions in particular cases or in categories of cases.  It is proper that this be left to the Authority to decide, in the words of subsection (2), &ldquo;having regard to all relevant market conditions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry made the point that we should have a block exemption system but I would suggest to him that under section 4 (2) we have one.  The Competition Authority may grant a licence for the purposes of that section in the case of any agreement or category of agreements &mdash; that is a block exemption <Col N="1602" /> as there could be thousands of agreements in a category of agreements &mdash; or any decision or category of decisions or any category of concerted practices. Therefore, the point made is fully covered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan complained that we failed to define terms like &ldquo;distorted competition&rdquo; and as a result it may be necessary to refer cases to the European Court of Justice.  The courts here must take judicial notice of the Treaty and of the decisions of the European Court of Justice. These matters have been thrashed out in European Community jurisprudence and they apply here by virtue of Statutory Instrument No. 341 of 1972, which, I was surprised to discover, I myself made on 29 December 1972, a few days prior to our entry to the European Community, to come into effect on 1 January 1973.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point regarding the position that would pertain in Ireland so far as competition is concerned and that which might pertain in the European Community at large.  I sympathise with that up to a point but the law society pointed out that there was a need for certainty in this regard and to make clear what effect EC block exemptions will have in the Irish legal scene.  If the Minister takes the view it is inappropriate for them to have effect here and that they do not have effect here, we should consider including in the Bill a clear statement that notwithstanding the fact that EC block exemptions exist, they shall not be deemed to have force here and it shall be necessary to make an application to the Authority to obtain the same cover.  As I said earlier, there is a need for certainty.  The law society in their submission suggested that if the Bill is left as it is there will be uncertainty with the result that there could be litigation yet again being initiated in the High Court and possibly going to the European Court with all the rigmarole, waste of time and expense that would involve.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Minister's statement that it is not desirable to <Col N="1603" /> allow those companies who have received block exemptions from the European Community the same facility here.  The commercial committee of the Incorporated Law Society made a good point. It is quite clear that those companies who are refused an exemption under this legislation will not be allowed to appeal to the High Court.  The Minister is making a false argument.  They cannot appeal to the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Deputy Taylor did.  A third party can only appeal to the High Court if a licence is granted but if somebody applies and is refused a licence that is the end of it.  We would now have a ludicrous position where a company granted a block exemption in the European Community would have no recourse if their application for a licence was refused here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>They could apply to the High Court for a declaration that they would be covered by the European block exemption and if that became a European issue, the High Court would have to refer it on to the European Court for a determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>One can imagine the joy in the boardrooms as they contemplate that course of action while at the same time trying to keep the bank manager off their backs and the workforce happy.  They are trying to produce goods and create markets for them and it would be ridiculous if the time of board members was tied up in this kind of legal squabbling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tried to introduce an amendment which would allow them to appeal to the High Court but the Minister turned it <Col N="1604" /> down.  However, it will come up later. They would have to take the more tortuous route outlined by Deputy Taylor. The submission from the Incorporated Law Society covers this point.  Indeed my amendment, which was tabled before I saw the submission, makes this point also and I suggest the Minister should accept my amendment for the reasons set out in the submission of the Incorporated Law Society and the arguments made here.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to inter-company agreements and from his tone I understand he is sympathetic to the view that the parent company and not their subsidiary should be held responsible for an abuse of the dominant position because the subsidiary company have to accept instructions from their owners.  I do not think the Minister referred to another point I am concerned about &mdash; but I may be wrong &mdash; and that is the question of exemptions for companies engaged in interstate trading.  I think they should be exempt.  I do not think the point made by both Deputy Taylor and the Minister that the law has to be applied differently in this country is correct because, as I understand it, the EC Directive says that the law applies in the Community or in any section of the Community.  In fact, before granting an exemption the EC would have taken account of what is happening in Ireland because we are part of the Community, even though you wonder whether people realise it.  The EC would take account of our position because the exemptions apply to the Community or any part of it.  It would save a great deal of headache, boardroom wrangles and lawyers' and accountants' fees if the Minister would accept my amendment at this stage.</P>

      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which was agreed with the social partners, the Government are committed to the development of services for people with mental handicap. The recommendations of the report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services have been accepted in full in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The programme provides for the implementation of the commitment to develop services for people with a mental handicap and other community health services over the seven-year period of the plan.  Depending on the level of resources made available under the programme, it may be possible to implement the recommendations of the review group in a shorter period of time. I would like to assure the House of my commitment to implement the recommendations of the review group within the shortest possible period of time.</P>

      <P>At this stage we are one-third of the way through the review group's period for dealing with the problems of mental handicap.  Would the Minister not agree that for him to extend at this point the date for the residential and day places from 1994 to 1997 is equivalent to saying he will provide half of what is required each year for the mentally handicapped?  How much longer must the mentally handicapped wait in queue?</P>

      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy says.  In 1990 the Government provided an extra £2 million in the budget especially for those suffering from mental handicap.  As a result, 170 new residential places and 442 day care places were opened and respite care was provided for 200 persons with mental handicap.  The Government have already been working on that.  This year £2 million was again provided and a further £1 million to allow the opening of further places in the current year.  The Government are continuing to make steady progress in providing for the needs of those with mental handicap.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the provision of £1 million this year is a drop in the ocean against the £27.5 million projected to be needed over the five-year programme?  Does he not know that his provision even last year was less than that sought by the review group?  They were looking for more residential and day places than the Minister provided.  We have fallen behind in the first year and the Minister is planning that we will achieve only half the desired rate of progress in the remaining years.  To the mentally handicapped and their carers, this is a sleight of hand by the Minister.</P>

Not alone has the extra money I have outlined been provided in two successive budgets but between 1986 and 1991 there was a 40 per cent increase in the allocation made to the main providers of services for the mentally handicapped. I am satisfied that the Government are meeting their commitments.  I recognise that there are gaps in the service but those gaps will be filled.  For the first time, the Government have outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> how they intend to deal with the needs of people in the development of a whole range of community services, for the mentally handicapped, the elderly, the physically disabled, the mentally ill and dental services.  I reconstituted the co-ordinating committees in each health <Col N="1612" /> board to include representatives of the voluntary organisations and of my Department to draw up a plan within the PESP.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 80 together.  The need to improve hospital out-patient services has been recognised and, indeed, a commitment has been given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Porgress</i> to introduce measures to minimise waiting times by patients, provide comfortable waiting areas with appropriate amenities and provide patient information leaflets.</P>
      <P>I have recently received the third report of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group.  In drawing up this report, the group carried out a major examination of out-patient services in the Dublin hospitals covered by their work.  The group have highlighted the deficiencies they found in the present organisation of this service and have made extensive recommendations concerning the improvement of the operational management of out-patient departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be publishing the report in the near future and circulating copies to all the acute hospitals, asking them to immediately draw up plans to implement <Col N="1613" /> its recommendations.  I will also be establishing an implementation group, representative of members of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group and officials of my Department, to oversee the implementation process and to be available to advise the hospitals, as required.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the talk about administrative reform is a lot of waffle when the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, to which he referred, recommended in their first report that by October 1990 &mdash; eight months ago &mdash; this problem would be resolved?  The reality is that it is common place for people to have to wait from morning until late at night to receive care in outpatient departments.  Is the Minister aware of the recent report by the non-hospital consultant doctors of the IMO concerning the lack of supervision of these doctors by consultants who work in outpatient departments?  Would he not agree that there is a need to give proper priority to outpatients where half the admissions are now coming through casualty?</P>

      <P>It might be of interest to Deputies opposite to note that in the Dublin area the number of outpatients increased from 442,241 in 1989 to 478,048 in 1990, an increase of 8 per cent in the number of patients seen at outpatient clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of the issues which were addressed by the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group need to be looked at in some detail.  We have done much work on a number of them, including asking the hospitals to improve the timing of out-patient appointments, for example, to <Col N="1614" /> try to ensure that patients are not kept waiting and that outpatient appointment times are staggered throughout the morning. However, there are difficulties from time to time.  There may be difficulties in the nature of GP referrals and sometimes the patient does not have an appointment and turns up at the outpatients department.</P>
    <P>I accept the point that occasionally patients have to wait too long.  We wrote to the hospitals about that issue as far back as February 1990.  Obviously, when patients arrive too early for their appointments that results in a longer wait for them.  Problems are caused when patients do not arrive for appointments because it means the time which could be given to other patients is wasted.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the physical condition of outpatient departments. A great deal of excellent work has been done in this area.  I opened a major out-patient department in St. James's Hospital &mdash; a public hospital for public patients &mdash; and the standard there would compare favourably with any similar out-patient service in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to accept that a long wait is common place rather than the exception.  The Minister will have to accept also that nurses in the Mater Hospital have threatened a go-slow because of the impossibility of dealing with the conditions there; and lack of supervision is common place. I would ask the Minister to set about getting the October 1990 date implemented within weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the nature of hospital outpatient departments is such that there will be some wait.  Because of the more sophisticated methods of investigation patients are investigated in outpatient departments rather than having to go into an inpatient bed.  This means that patients are in the outpatients departments much longer <Col N="1615" /> than they were, say, ten or 15 years ago when they were generally taken into hospital for two or three days.  We have been in touch with the hospitals about improving the position of waiting times and staggering the appointments system to ensure that patients do not have to wait.  I have stated frequently in the House that it is unacceptable that 30 or 40 patients should be asked to attend the outpatients departments at 9 a.m. and some are still there at 11 a.m.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the House during the debate on the Health (Amendment) Bill, the new eligibility arrangements are being introduced on a phased basis.  The first two stages of the process were implemented on Saturday, 1 June when the Health (Amendment) Act came into effect.  Firstly, the income limit for category 2 services was removed from that date, so that all those who wish to avail of public consultant care may now do so.  Secondly, the clear identification of the status of every patient, as either the public or private patient of the consultant, was implemented in each public hospital, also on 1 June.</P>
      <P>The next stage of the process involves the designation of public and private beds and the gradual implementation of the requirement that, except in emergency cases, private patients must be accommodated in designated private beds and public patients in designated public beds. The Health Services (In-Patient) Regulations, 1991, which have been laid before the House, specify that the designation of beds is subject in all cases to my approval and also provide for the phasing, over a three-year period, of the requirements in relation to access to beds, again subject to my approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1618" /> My Department are at present involved in discussions with each health board and voluntary hospital in relation to their proposals for the designation of beds and the phasing of the requirements in relation to their use.  I have made it clear that my approval of proposals will be based on careful examination of the information available on the pattern of usage of each hospital as between public and private patients.  The purpose of the new system is to benefit public patients by giving them greater access to public beds.  Private patients will be adequately catered for in private beds and semi-private beds.  The number of the latter beds can increase if this proves necessary, but this will be on a self-funding basis and will not be at the expense of public beds.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 22 together.  The Commission on Health Funding did not refer to charges for in-patient care as inappropriate. On the contrary, the commission endorsed the modest charges which apply to in-patient services as a contribution towards the cost of providing them, with exclusions for appropriate groups such as medical card holders; and endorsed maintenance charges for private accommodation which reflect the full cost of providing this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer the Minister to the health commission's report in which they state that regulatory charges are unnecessary in the case of in-patient treatment and the proposed uniform admission policy will ensure that only those in genuine need of care are admitted.  It is clear from the tenure of their recommendations, as elaborated further on in the document, that they do not regard in-patient services as ones which should be charged to people on middle and low incomes who avail of these services and have to pay £12.50. Would the Minister not agree that since the commission made their recommendation he has increased this charge by 25 per cent and that this flies in the face of the commission's recommendation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to paragraph 12.48 of the commission's report in which they refer to the £10 charge and the £100 charge over any 12 month period for in-patient services. The commission believe that a charge of this nature does not expose patients to severe financial hardship. Medical card holders and those receiving treatment for certain conditions are exempt from this charge.  The charge can be applied with discretion in circumstances where hardship might arise. They say that a charge of this magnitude <Col N="1620" /> can be justified on the basis that it goes some way towards reducing the cost to taxpayers of services provided to the individual patient, particularly in relation to hotel costs such as food and bed linen as distinct from medical or nursing care.</P>
      <P>I too believe that the charges are modest.  It is appropriate that where patients use a hospital bed it should not cost them less than it would cost them to have treatment through their general practitioner and the provision of drugs outside the hospital.  I am sure Deputies will agree that financial incentives should not be put in the way of patients to go to hospital.</P>

      <P>It should be pointed out to the authors of that report that it is not a fair comparison.  Is the Minister aware of the number of appeals all of us have to make to health boards in relation to this charge?

      <P>The regulations to which I have referred apply to long-stay hospitals, psychiatric hospitals and homes and hospitals for the elderly.  A patient who spends longer than 30 days in any one of these hospitals is required to pay a charge.  My information is that patients receiving ongoing acute medical <Col N="1623" /> treatment in acute general hospitals are not obliged to pay a charge.  However, in cases where patients are being maintained in acute hospitals for whatever reason the charge is made after 30 days.</P>

      <P>I want to put the record straight.  For the second time the Minister has accused the late Brendan Corish of bringing in a regulation in 1976 imposing charges on people in acute care, but that is not correct. No patient with a medical card was ever charged for acute treatment.</P>

      <P>The illnesses covered by the long term illness scheme are: mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalous, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. Persons suffering from any of these illnesses can obtain, without charge, drugs and medicines for the treatment of their condition.  There are over 45,000 people availing of this scheme at an annual cost in excess of £8 million.</P>
      <P>Many other persons with a chronic illness are eligible for the full range of health services under the general medical services scheme without charge and the chief executive officer of a health board may take into account expenditure incurred by a person on drugs, medicines and general practitioner care when determining eligibility for this scheme.</P>
      <P>Other persons who do not qualify for the above two schemes and who are certified as having a long-term medical condition with a continuing requirement for prescribed medication are eligible for the drug cost subsidisation scheme, which I introduced last year, and are not required to pay the pharmacist more than £32 per month for their prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>It was to alleviate the difficulty for these people that I introduced the drug cost subsidisation scheme last year.  As Deputies are aware, previous to that scheme being introduced many of these people were obliged to pay perhaps £100 or to wait three, four or five months for the refund to which they were entitled.  That scheme has ensured that those people are obliged to pay only £32 per month and that they do not have the anxiety of waiting for perhaps over £100, depending on the cost of their medication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very conscious of the point made by the Deputy when it was decided to increase the threshold from £28 to £32.  The most recent previous increase was made in December 1983.  The increase at that time, when the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party were in Government, was 75 per cent, an increase of £16 in one year.  After eight years we have increased it by £4, which I believe to be a modest increase.</P>
      <P>I also point out to the Deputy that no addition to the long term illnesses has been included in that scheme since 1975.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to extend the range of that scheme at the moment.  While I agree with Deputy Ferris that persons suffering from asthma <Col N="1629" /> do need constant and ongoing treatment, it would be true to say that several other illnesses such as chronic bronchitis, blood pressure, heart problems and skin diseases &mdash; which we hear very little about but which are probably some of the most expensive conditions to treat &mdash; also cause patients much trouble.  The reintroduction of the drug cross-subsidisation scheme is an attempt to alleviate their burden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Does the Minister not agree that, despite all of the difficulties with regard to the definition of asthma, it should be accepted that someone who is gasping for breath, as distinct from someone who might have to take it easy because of heart problems or some other condition, deserves to be recognised as being under terrible pressure? The Minister, as a doctor, does not need to be told that as a result of asthma such a person's heart is under pressure as well.  The position is absurd.  I have asked at health board meetings for a definition of asthma.  Could the medical profession decide that asthma can be recognised as a long term illness?  Red herrings about bronchitis, hay fever and a whole rigmarole of illnesses are not really relevant; asthma sufferers do suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a very interesting point: what is the definition of asthma as distinct from chronic bronchitis?  There is a very fine dividing line that is not always apparent. Even if asthma were to be included on the list doctors would be faced with a problem of definition, as the Deputy pointed out himself.  In certain circumstances it would be difficult to identify which patient had asthma and which patient had chronic bronchitis.  That example highlights the difficulty of taking one specific group whose medicine is expensive and leaving out other groups such as the groups I have referred to, for example, people with blood pressure problems and people with heart problems. That is what we had in mind in introducing the drug cross-subsidisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> I also point out that 35 per cent of the population are covered by medical cards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to check the percentage of people who have full eligibility to medical cards, because I think the figure given out recently does not correspond.  I wish to ask the Minister two supplementary questions.  First, does the Minister know that the incidence of asthma seems to be on the increase among children and that it imposes great hardship on families marginally over the limit for full eligibility? Secondly, is the Minister aware that because of mark-ups and so on it costs more to dispense drugs on drug cards than are issued to pharmacists?  Instead of the use of drug cards I should like the Minister to examine the possibility of extending eligibility for medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 1.2 million people covered by medical cards.  As has been discussed in the House before, there was a reduction in the number of medical cards issued following a change in the method of payment to general practitioners from fee for service to capitation. Under the new capitation arrangement doctors are paid on the basis of each patient on the GMS list.  It was necessary for the boards to ensure that there would be no payment for patients who no longer existed.  People who had either moved away or died were removed from the lists, which did reduce the total percentage.</P>

    <P>I have read various reports concerning the incidence of asthma in children.  I do not have up-to-date information here today, but again I make the point that chief executive officers have discretion to ensure that nobody is denied treatment, either medical treatment or the issue of <Col N="1631" /> drugs, because of inability to pay.  I know that that discretion is used, and so does every Deputy in the House.  There are people who would be over the limit on the guidelines issued but who do have medical cards because of their particular circumstances, very often because of a particular disability.</P>

However, the drug bill represents about 10 per cent of the cost of the public health service and the method of the supply of drugs is always under review.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>Formal negotiations on the implementation of the recommendations of the Review Body (Gleeson) Report on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector on Hospital Consultants were completed on 20 May 1991.  At a meeting held on that day a final set of proposals was presented to the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.  I understand that the two bodies concerned intend to ballot their members on the proposed revised contract.  I expect to receive the formal response of the two organisations at the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the agreement talked about by the Minister propose a greater role for consultants in many hospitals, as has been referred to previously, and would the Minister elaborate on the way he expects that to be implemented?  Would there also be an agreement whereby chief executive officers could previously direct a consultant in regard to a medical problem or medical issue in a hospital?  What increases are granted to consultants under the agreement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the consultants are balloting on the results of the negotiations at the moment, it would not be appropriate, as with any industrial negotiations, to go into any great depth.  The memorandum that consultants are voting on ranges over a wide number of issues, <Col N="1633" /> including the nature of the consultant appointments, the structuring of consultant appointments, their remuneration and expenses, conditions of employment, superannuation, the nature and conduct of employment relationships, consultants in management, grievance and dispute procedures and provision for review of contract.  When negotiations are finalised I shall be glad to deal with that matter in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What effect does the Minister predict this will have on public patients given that it will cost £35 million? Will the Minister comment on the dropping of the deduction that was included in the Gleeson recommendation for private practice, where consultants would be paid less if they had a large private practice? Will the Minister comment on whether or not that will represent damage to availability to public patients? Would the Minister comment also on the dropping of the common waiting list that was envisaged by Gleeson and what impact that will have on the result of this contract for public patients?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with the question of the common waiting list at length during the debate on eligibility.  The common waiting list would be to the disadvantage of public patients.  What we have achieved in eligibility is in the best interest of public patients.  In future public beds will be available for public patients only.  Where formerly private patients used public beds as public patients and paid their consultant as a private patient, that will no longer be allowed in the new arrangements so that those public beds will be free for public patients.  If we had a common waiting list we could not have that system because by definition the next patient on the list would go directly into whatever bed was available and it would be the decision of the consultant as to who was next on the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the deduction as outlined in the Gleeson report, the Deputies will appreciate that the Gleeson report was <Col N="1634" /> published before the decision on eligibility was taken and that during the negotiations the question of eligibility, which was a change for the consultants, was taken into account and therefore what is in the Gleeson report in relation to the deduction for the use of private facilities does not apply as a result of that change in eligibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that there will definitely be fewer private patients in public beds in our hospitals?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Will a patient entering the hospital who wishes to go private be private to the hospital or private to the consultant?  Will the consultant still have private beds in our hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  At the moment there are three categories.  There are public patients in public beds, private patients in semi-private and private beds and up to 1 June there were private patients who availed of public beds who paid their consultant as private patients. That third category will no longer exist. There are only two categories, public patients in public beds and private patients in private or semi-private accommodation. Everyone can opt for one or other.  A private patient of the consultant is automatically a private patient of the hospital.  One cannot be a private patient of the consultant and a public patient of the hospital.  That is no longer possible. In an emergency, patients will be dealt with and they will use whatever bed is available.  An emergency will never be refused treatment or a bed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The £35 million is a big charge on the taxpayer.  The Minister has not eliminated the back door way to care in public hospitals.  How does the Minister propose to deal with the situation whereby a patient can go to a consultant's private consulting room and if it is deemed necessary to go into hospital, he can go immediately on to a public list, as against a patient who will possibly have <Col N="1635" /> to wait 18 months from an appointment in the hospital in the consultant's private room?  How does the Minister reconcile the two cases?  There is an 18 month head start for the patient who goes to the private room as against the patient who goes to the public hospital.  The Minister has not yet given an answer to that despite the many questions that have been asked by us.  The health boards do not know the answer.  I would like to hear the Minister's explanation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>The average daily cost of maintaining an elderly person in long stay care facilities at the end of 1990 are as set out hereunder:</P>
      <P> (a)  a geriatric hospital £26.00</P>
      <P>(b)  a district hospital £41.00</P>
      <P>(c)  a welfare home £14.00  </P>
      <P>These costs are exclusive of capital outlay.</P>
      <P>While there is no precise figure available for the expenditure incurred by health boards in supporting an elderly person and his-her carer in the home, any calculation would involve taking account of costs associated with the provision of the following services:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Meals on wheels and home helps;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Transport to day care;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Respite care;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Visits by public health nurses; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;Paramedical services such as physiotherapy, chiropody and occupational therapy.  </P>
      <P>In addition, the circumstances of the individual elderly person must be taken into account, as the more dependent the person is, the greater will be the level of support required in the home.</P>
      <P>My Department have commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to carry out research on the comparative costs of caring for the elderly in long stay institutions and in the community.  The results of this research are expected shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department are committed to the development of services for the elderly as recommended in the report of the working party on services for the elderly &mdash;&ldquo;The Years Ahead &mdash; a Policy for the Elderly&rdquo;.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> includes a commitment to improve health services for the elderly as recommended in &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo; over the seven year period of the programme.  We are working with the health boards to expand the range of <Col N="1640" /> support to elderly people and their carers at home and in the community and in ensuring that the elderly receive a high standard of specialist care in hospital and extended care appropriate to their needs.</P>
    <P>In 1990 the Government made a special allocation of £5 million to develop home and community support for the elderly and their carers.  This year the Government made an additional £3 million available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The priority this year is to improve hospital and extended care services for the elderly.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the comparison of £280 per week to have someone in care as against available funds, such as the carer's allowance which is a maximum £50 and received by only 3 per cent of carers in the community, shows a complete lack of attention to their problems?  Will he agree to the publication of a charter for carers which would guarantee them specific levels of service across the range of home help, therapy and so on, so that carers would have accessibility to them and which the report on carers has plainly shown they do not now have?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare introduced a new scheme which extended considerably the range of <Col N="1641" /> people who can apply for a carer's allowance whereas formerly, under the precribed relatives allowance, a very small number of relatives were entitled to apply for the scheme.  Indeed, the rate of payment in relation to that scheme was £28 per week but the Minister for Social Welfare brought in a new scheme which not alone extended the range of people who could apply for the carer's allowance but also increased the figure to £45 per week the year he introduced it.  He further extended the range of people who would qualify for the scheme by including those in receipt of the disabled person's allowance this year by increasing the rate to £50 per week.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a pilot scheme, the boarding-out allowance scheme, whereby elderly people are integrated with domestic homes of non-relative families in the Western Health Board area is on the point of collapse because the board have been authorised to pay only £25 per week per patient?  This, coupled with half the old age pension, brings to a mere £60 the contribution which these people receive. The 70 elderly people in Counties Mayo, Galway and Roscommon are literally on <Col N="1643" /> the side of the road and will be knocking on the doors of health boards from next week unless the amount is increased.  It seems to be short sighted, socially regressive and economically draft, in the context of the figures the Minister quoted today, that this is the figure for the maintenance of people in public geriatric wards.</P>

      <P>With regard to the programme for the care of the elderly, the Minister has not made provision for extra beds in geriatric hospitals.  This means that beds used for long stay patients are being used as respite care beds.  People have to sign a form to say that they will take the patient home after a fortnight or so, irrespective of their condition.  Is the Minister aware that families who can no longer cope with an elderly person have a problem?  If a relative has been discharged from an acute hospital they are likely to refer him or her to a nursing home which they cannot afford.  It is a very serious problem at present.</P>

      <P>Facilities for the elderly have been substantially improved during the past two years.  I have already mentioned that £5 million was provided in 1990 while £3 million is being provided in 1991 in addition to the £5 million.  I accept that most but not all of the <Col N="1644" /> improvements have taken place in community care services.  It has long been recognised that if extra facilities were provided in the community a greater number of the elderly would be able to live in their own homes or in the community. I am sure every Deputy will accept that it is only right and proper that the elderly should be able to live in their own homes or in their community for as long as possible and should only be cared for in a nursing home as a last resort.  It is important to point out that only 5 per cent of the elderly are being cared for in long-stay residential centres but this should only be as a last resort.  Money is being provided in the current year under the nursing homes legislation to allow the health boards make payments to private nursing homes in respect of patients.</P>

The Minister stated that it is very difficult to compare the cost of caring for the elderly in long-stay residential centres with the cost of paying carers to look after them in the home 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Is the Minister aware <Col N="1645" /> that only 1,600 people out of a total of 60,000 are in receipt of the allowance at the maximum rate?

Surely his Department have information on the age profile of the population.  There is a lack of suitable accommodation for the elderly in the community.  Their relatives are no longer in a position to care for them and they cannot afford the fees charged by private nursing homes because of the failure of the Minister's Department to provide an adequate allocation to health boards under the nursing homes legislation to pay subventions in respect of public patients to private nursing homes.  The Department have failed to adopt a planned approach to this matter.</P>

      <P>All the evidence suggests that people are extremely happy with the public health nursing service being provided.  Deputy Creed raised the question of planning.  I agree with him that planning is necessary but I disagree with him when he says that we have not made any plans.  Not alone have we made plans but the working party have produced the report &ldquo;The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly&rdquo;.  We have also incorporated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> our plans for the <Col N="1647" /> next seven years in relation to the elderly. I am very proud to be the Minister who has improved facilities during the past two years in the community to ensure that as many of the elderly as possible can continue to live in their own homes or community and are only cared for in long-stay institutions as a last resort.  I would also point out that we do not see caring for the elderly in the community as a cheap option.  It is not, it costs just as much to care for them in the community. Whatever it takes we must ensure a high quality of life will be provided for the elderly.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5) Before granting a licence or issuing a certificate under this section the authority shall cause to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in at least two daily newspapers published in the State the fact that they have received an application for such a licence or such a certificate giving brief particulars thereof and shall invite any concerned person to make representations to them as to why such licence or certificate should not be granted.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the structures laid down in the Bill for the procedures to follow when applying for a licence or a certificate to be rather strange.  It appears that a company who wish to get an exemption, a licence or a certificate make what amounts to a private application to the Authority and nobody knows that this application is pending.  Individuals or companies could be very seriously affected by the grant of such a licence or certificate and they would not even know that the application was pending or that the Authority was adjudicating on the application before them.  Obviously there is a potential conflict of interest between a person applying for this exemption or licence and other <Col N="1711" /> traders who may very well have something to say to the Authorities but cannot because they do not even know that the application is pending.  Strangely, the Bill provides that after the decision is given and the Authority have concluded their one-sided examination of the applicant and have reached their decision &mdash; in other words when the horse is gone &mdash; then and only then is notification of the decision to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> I find that very strange, puzzling and totally unacceptable.  Section 6 provides that if a person is aggrieved as a result of the grant of a licence or certificate by the Authority they can appeal to the High Court.  Thank you very much for that. The first notification that the ordinary person or a company has of having been adversely affected by the grant of a licence by the Authority is the appearance of the decision in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and if they wish to do anything about it they have to undertake major litigation in the High Court with all the expense that involves.  This Bill has been described as a lawyers' paradise, and this is one of the reasons it is so described.  Why should the Bill not provide for the more logical procedure that when an application for a licence is made to the Authority it is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in a couple of newspapers so that interested people would know that the application is pending before the Authorities and the affected parties could make their observations to the Authority.  This would ensure that the Authority was in full possession of all the facts so that they could make an advised decision knowing both sides of the problem presented on the application.  That is normal logic and normal legal procedure, and ensures that the granting of a licence is not based on a one-sided application based on the information put forward by the parties seeking the application.</P>
    <P>The role of the Authority has been described as quasi-judicial nature, and so it is.  As has been said, their decisions would be subject to judicial review as it is a judicial-type tribunal.  Surely it is of the essence of any judicial or quasi-judicial <Col N="1712" /> tribunal that they have the opportunity to hear both sides of the question and not just the viewpoint of the company or undertaking looking for a very major boon to their business, the right to derogate from the law, the right to commit anti-competitive practices, a licence to do something which is otherwise prohibited. On their say-so and their's alone will the Authority come to their decision.  I am well aware that persons aggrieved by the granting of a licence may appeal to the High Court.  But why should they be compelled to do that at the very first stage of their knowledge?  Why throw the matter headlong into the High Court, which would cost thousands, when they could have a more basic and informal hearing before the Authority or even if it was not a hearing at all they could send in a letter of explanation saying what their position is and stating the effect that the grant of a licence or this exemption would have on them?  It seems very strange to publish the notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and the newspapers when the decision is already made.</P>
    <P>The purport of my amendment would be to require the advertisement of applications pending before the Authority before the decision is made, so that a person or company who pick up this information can make representations and indicate to the Authority what effect it will have on them and on their business and the Authority can give an advised decision on whether to grant the licence rather than of necessity throwing the matter into the High Court.  In every case where an aggrieved party wants to do something about the grant of a licence or an exemption, the only tribunal open to them will be the High Court.  The tribunal of the Authority will not be available to them because they will have no means of knowing that the application is pending. It seems a very logical and appropriate amendment and I would ask the House to accept it.</P>

      <P>These amendments from amendment No. 21 on address issues which are purely procedural.  If <Col N="1713" /> these are to be provided for then it should be either by the Authority adopting procedures or, if absolutely necessary, the Minister prescribing procedures for the Authority.  If procedures are laid down in the Bill which are subsequently found to be unnecessary, inadequate, unduly burdensome or otherwise undesirable in some way, they can only be changed by another Act or by primary legislation.  If the Authority dispensed with those statutory requirements because they thought they were too onerous or unsuitable, it would call into legal doubt the Authority's own decisions.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 6 (3) of the Schedule permits the Authority to regulate their own procedures, subject to the Act.  This includes being subject to regulations made by the Minister under section 7 (6).  Such procedures as might be made either by the Authority or by the Minister include drawing up guidelines for undertakings submitting applications for a licence, issuing a <i>pro forma</i> document for applications, setting time limits for the consideration of licence and certificate applications, providing consultation mechanisms for parties to agreements and issuing invitations to third parties for submissions in relation to applications or to studies and analyses under section 11.</P>
      <P>The Authority might also take decisions in relation to the publication of negative decisions of the Authority.  The Authority are obliged by the Bill to publish decisions in relation to the granting of a licence or a certificate.  The Authority might take decisions in relation to the publication of an intention to grant an extension to a licence under section 8 (2) and the Authority might take decisions on the content of their annual report under section 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 would require the Authority to carry out administrative action which may or may not be appropriate. It is certainly not appropriate to make these requirements compulsory in the Bill.  These are issues best left to practical experience and to ministerial regulation, where necessary.  The notion <Col N="1714" /> of a quarterly report is overly bureaucratic. The Authority will be publishing on a regular basis their decisions as they are made.  Apart from the annual report which is already provided for in section 12, there is no need for further periodic reports.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment No. 25 in my name removes the necessity to have the full text of the decision published in two newspapers.  The full text will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and a notice to that effect will be published in one daily newspaper.  The full text of subsection (6), as amended by the Government amendment, would read as follows:</P>
    <P>On granting a licence or issuing a certificate under this section, the Authority shall forthwith give notice in the prescribed manner to every body to which it relates stating the terms and the date thereof and the reasons therefor and cause the notice to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and cause notice of the grant of the licence or issue of the certificate, as the case may be, to be published in one daily newspaper. </P>
    <P>Amendment No. 26 deals with the publication of refusals of licences or certificates. Since refusals have no effect on third parties, publication is not essential. It will be possible for the Authority to publish where they consider that it might be beneficial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Specifically on Deputy Taylor's amendment which is before us, it seems that the Minister is untypically conveying a lack of conviction about his own measure.  This is the second or third occasion when he has pleaded with the House to permit him to enact the legislation as it stands and to see how the Authority will work in practice.  That seems undesirable, having regard to the moment of what we are discussing.  For the Minister to dismiss the import of Deputy Taylor's amendment as being purely procedural seems to play down entirely the significance of what is being sought.  If there were any such thing in business or commercial law as the concept of natural justice, surely any third <Col N="1715" /> party potentially affected would have the right to make a submission in advance of the granting of a licence.  There is very little point in talking about its being published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in two daily newspapers after the grant of the licence in question.</P>
      <P>The Minister said last week that the purpose of using the term &ldquo;licence&rdquo; in this section is to emphasise the administrative as distinct from the judicial.  In this circumstance the Authority will be acting in a quasi-judicial sense and making a decision of the most profound import not only for the undertakings seeking the derogation but potentially for third parties who will be affected.  In those circumstances it seems imperative that these third parties should have the opportunity in advance of the licence being granted to make a submission.  I am quite sure that most of those undertakings engaged in anti-competitive practices or in concerted in practices as envisaged by this Bill and to whom a derogation would probably apply, are quite convinced that what they are doing is quite proper and necessary in the national and economic interest.  I am sure even those who do not expect to get a derogation and who ought not get a derogation will be similarly convinced that what they are doing is correct and proper. It is only by opening the process to third parties who are potentially affected that the Authority can fully weigh in the balance the evidence about whether or not that is the case.  That interested third parties should be kept in the dark and unaware of the fact that the Authority are seized of a particular application, is contrary to natural justice and undesirable. It invites appeal to the High Court, which in many if not all cases is undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The more we go into this Bill the more extraordinary I find the Minister's response to points made from the Opposition benches.  He talks about the undesirability of having too many regulations and about letting the Authority find their own feet and draft their <Col N="1716" /> own rules.  He is asking us to give a blank cheque to the Authority in deciding how to regulate themselves, then he says it is undesirable to write this into legislation but he has no problem writing in whether the advertisement should be published in one or two newspapers.  Surely that is bureaucracy carried to the extreme.</P>
      <P>Everything he has said in the debate on this Bill the last day and today seems to point in the direction of controls, of blind faith in the operation of the Authority from the bureaucratic point of view, but anything that might benefit the people affected by the Bill, the consumer, the business community or the commercial world, must be regulated but not the other way round.  The Bill has been drafted by a Machiavellian partnership with a bureaucrat in an ivory tower.  Nothing in this Bill shows common sense.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely clear in natural justice that if somebody will be affected by a regulation he should be given notice of that, at the very least by way of an advertisement in the papers saying the Competition Authority are considering an application for an exemption from the Competition Act by such and such a firm in relation to such and such a product, and sufficient time then should be allowed for representations to be made as to why that application should not be granted.  Apparently the Minister is not going to provide for that.  He is just going to let the Authority make the decision. To give it even a narrower circulation of interest, his amendment provides that the readers of only one newspaper should know about this, not even the readers of two newspapers.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the Minister.  It appears he has not looked very closely at this Bill.  Many things in it are certainly not in the interest of creating jobs or promoting competition or in the interests of the commercial or business world.  The provisions do nothing to promote more economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need competition badly.  There is no ceiling above which this Bill will operate. It affects every business in the country. The Confederation of Irish Industry <Col N="1717" /> in the introduction to their submission to every Member of this Dáil said that every single business undertaking will be affected by this Bill, yet we appear to be getting no response from the Minister to very reasonable amendments put down here.</P>
    <P>To accept amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 23 in Deputy Taylor's name and mine and the first half of my amendment No. 24 is the very minimum the Minister could concede.  Where somebody's business undertaking is going to be affected by a decision of the Competition Authority, it is only right that notice of that fact be given publicly to the people concerned. If an industry have applied for an exemption and they are in competition with some other firm, that firm should know there is a danger their position will be affected by a decision made by the Authority.  It is not reasonable that the first the people concerned know about the decision of the Authority is when they see it announced in a newspaper &mdash; if they see it.  Think of the number of daily newspapers.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment provides that notice of the grant of the licence or issue of the certificate will be published in one daily newspaper.  That is all that is provided if the Minister's amendment is carried.  It does not say where that newspaper will be circulated.  It could be an evening paper published in Britain or anywhere else.  They the affected person can refer to it if he happens to see it and finds out how the decision of the Competition Authority has affected his business.  The only recourse of such an individual or group at that stage is to go to the High Court, and many people have only too painful financial experience of what going to the High Court means.  It is an extremely expensive undertaking.</P>
    <P>The second part of amendment No. 24 makes a different point, although on the same matter.  It refers to the authority granting or refusing an exemption and it provides that: &ldquo;In doing so the Authority shall have regard to the legitimate interest of undertakings in the protection of the confidentiality of their business.&rdquo;. <Col N="1718" /> The CII make the point that all agreements have a potential economic effect and any agreements or practices notified to the Competition Authority which expose an enterprise to liability for damages may be prohibited.  That means, to be on the safe side, if they do not decide to do it themselves they are involved in more expense employing accountants to comply with this section.  All businesses involved will have to consult their lawyers and accountants and if there is the slightest doubt, their lawyers and accountants, to protect themselves, will advise their clients to apply for an exemption.</P>
    <P>The probability is that the Competition Authority in their initial period will be flooded with applications for exemptions. Each concern will fear that if they apply, the information they would have to give to the Competition Authority will not be kept confidential and the people with whom they are in competition will find out some of their business secrets.  That is why it is necessary to include some confidentiality in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 23 and the first half of amendment No. 24.  The Minister is probably right in saying that the fears about this Bill are exaggerated but that does not mean that the fear is not real to people who are afraid they may be caught by the Bill's provisions.  The Minister must do everything possible to allay those fears and show them that this Bill provides adequate measures to protect confidentiality in this case and in the other case I mentioned this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be making the point that amendment No. 21, providing for prior notification to interested parties of the fact that an application for a licence or an exemption is pending, is a procedural matter.  If it is a procedural matter, then so is section 4 (5) because it provides that: &ldquo;Before granting a licence or issuing a certificate under this section, the Authority may invite any Minister of the Government concerned in the matter to offer such observations as he may wish to make.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If procedural matters are to be <Col N="1719" /> excluded, and notification to a third party is a procedural matter and not included for that reason, why is a special clause put in to provide that the Authority may invite any Minister of the Government to make observations on a pending application? Can the Minister explain why any Minister is given this special mention, that the Authority may notify him of a pending application, but a person, company or trader who could be very seriously adversely affected by such a licence being granted is totally ruled out from receiving any notification?  It is not that procedural matters are excluded from the Bill to be dealt with at some future date.  If that were so, subsection (5) would not be there.  The real intention is that for some strange reason, third parties are not to be given prior notification of pending applications.  I cannot imagine what that is unless it is some diabolical scheme to substantially increase the earnings of lawyers in the High Court.  That is the only logical reason that comes out of the provisions of the Bill as it stands.  Surely the whole thrust of modern thinking in society today is to try to avoid the expense, problems and delays involved in major High Court actions, if at all possible.  Surely that ought to be an objective of Government in a modern society.  Why run people into the High Court when it may not be necessary to do so?  Hereby a very simple procedure can be devised under which a substantial number of cases which would otherwise end up in the High Court can be dealt with and concluded satisfactorily in a cheaper, simpler and more expeditious hearing of the matter before the Authority.  This Authority would be more expert on the issue because they would be dealing with it all the time, unlike the High Court.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister assure the House definitively &mdash; and I ask him to deal with this point in his reply &mdash; that the procedure will be brought in immediately under which prior notification will be given to interested third parties so that they will know that an application is pending and will have the opportunity to <Col N="1720" /> make representations in opposition to a pending application for a licence or a certificate?  If the Minister is giving that undertaking I would be very happy to accept it and to withdraw the amendment. If not, it seems to me we have a very serious problem.  I cannot understand how anybody in the House can stand over the notion that a one sided decision will be made, assuming it is constitutional, based only on the representations of the applicant seeking the licence with no knowledge to the interested parties who may be affected by it.  That is wrong in principle, it is wrong in logic, it is wrong in common sense, it is wrong in justice.  The intention must be to do just that because when one looks at subsection (5) and finds that only a Minister of the State is given special mention as being able to receive advance notice of the fact that an application is pending, one is led to the inevitable conclusion that there is no intention to make provision for prior notification to interested third parties.</P>
    <P>If the whole question of publishing notices of applications and decisions is a procedural matter, subsection (6) would also be a procedural matter and yet it too is included in the Bill.  It is not that procedural matters are excluded to be dealt with later because many procedural matters of importance are rightly included in the Bill.  There is no basic axiom that no procedural matters are included in the Bill.  I would have thought it was very appropriate to include them in the Bill if they are of sufficient importance to warrant that.  What could be more important than a serious application affecting a person's livelihood, the viability of a company and its employees coming before an authority for a decision?  Why should the Authority be deprived of the full facts before coming to their decision?  When you think it through, the Authority are being deprived of crucial information which they may need to enable them to arrive at an informed decision.  Apparently, by a deliberate act we are taking the step of depriving them of crucial information which, if they had such information, may <Col N="1721" /> result in their arriving at a different decision altogether and thereby making unnecessary the whole panpoly of a High Court hearing with all the costs on both sides that that entails, taking up precious time in the High court for days on end. We have legislation going through which seeks to appoint more High court judges. A few more may be needed to take up unnecessary appeals as a result of this strange measure being introduced today. It is a logical and sensible measure and I hope the Minister will agree, at this late stage, to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Taylor in what he has stated in relation to subsection (5).  I cannot understand why a Minister of a Government must be singled out for special attention under the provisions of this section and that he or she must be the only person who would be invited to have a submission made to the Authority in respect of a matter that may come before them.  Surely we have had many examples in recent years where a Minister was in a position to influence the decision of an authority.  By a selective submission to the Authority he could unduly influence the decision that might be made by the Authority.  We can accept an undertaking from the present Minister that there would not be any undue influence on a decision of the Competition Authority but he may not always be Minister for Industry and Commerce and this legislation will continue to be on the Statute Book.  Any other Minister could, on invitation from the Authority, unduly influence such a decision.  I support Deputy Taylor and Deputy Barry in appealing to the Minister to accept the amendments which would allow companies to make submissions so that the full information is proprely heard.  The Competition Authority would then be in a much better position to make a mature and proper decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point that has been made in regard to subsection (5) &mdash; which is not the subject of these amendments &mdash; this provision was inserted to ensure that the Authority will <Col N="1722" /> be aware of public policy whey they take decisions.  That stands to reason and is a normal provision.  The decisions, although they will be better informed as a result of knowing what public policy is, will remain independent of the wishes of any particular Minister who is consulted, who will simply have a right to state his view or policy in regard to the matter.</P>
      <P>So far as compulsory advertisements of every application being made are concerned, as I have explained already, it seems inappropriate in the interests of trying to minimise costs and bureaucracy that every single one of these applications would have to be advertised because many of them will be repeat type applications and a huge proportion of them will be similar type applications.  It would be ridiculous to force each one of these to be advertised in one or more newspapers at some considerable cost.  It is considered, not just off the top of somebody's head, but after lengthy consideration of all the different options, that the appropriate way of dealing with the advertising requirement or suggestion or the giving of notice is that the Authority have the jurisdiction to do that as they see fit.  If, for example, they receive 100 similar applications, the fact that they advertise the existence of one is sufficient and they should not have to advertise the other 99 where the same considerations apply.  In these circumstances, I cannot give an undertaking, such as was requested by Deputy Taylor, that every single application be publicly notified. The fact that a provision to that effect is not contained in the Bill does not mean that the Authority or the Minister will not wish to do that in appropriate cases but not in cases where it is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Authority will be the best judge of that and it should be left to them. I understand that that is their view also.  It would be enormously costly and bureaucratic if this obligation was put everywhere. There is an obligation on them to advertise the granting of a licence or a certificate.  However, this is a different matter; it is a derogation from the law and when it is finalised it becomes part <Col N="1723" /> appropriate that when a licence is granted it should be advertised or public notice given of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor made the point that because some procedural matters are dealt with in the Bill every procedural matter should be dealt with in it.  I do not think this proposal stands up.  Some procedural matters are dealt with in the Bill but they are only the minimum necessary to ensure legal security.  Because various multifarious other matters are not dealt with specifically in the Bill it will not stop them being dealt with in regulations made either by the Minister or the Authority.  That is why these powers are there.  For examples, it would be entirely unreasonable if the rules of the courts and all the various procedural points which arise had to be laid down in this House in Acts of the Oireachtas. We would be in an impossible position because as circumstances changed and the rules of court needed to be changed it would necessitate coming back here with full primary legislation.  I do not think anyone would argue that that would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Equally, by way of analogy, it should be accepted that the same principle applies in this case.  The kind of things we are talking about are analogous to rules of court.  Therefore, I do not think it can or will happen in practice that particular types of applications will be dealt with by the Authority without their hearing several other points of view.  As I made clear at the outset, they will have ample powers to seek and hear submissions in regard to these matters.  I do not think the Authority would regard themselves to be doing their job adequately if they did not make arrangements to hear differing points of view in regard to a particular matter.  I do not think they could claim to have investigated the matter properly for the purpose of hearing an applications unless they had heard different points of view, not necessarily from every person who might want to offer a point of view but at the <Col N="1724" /> very least from people who are representive of and in similar circumstances to a larger group of people who would have a common commercial interest.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with the points made and that, on reflection, Deputies will appreciate that it would be unwise to try to lay down very detailed rules of procedure in primary legislation.  If any one of these rules do not work out in practice extactly as people would like it to, it would mean that we would have to come back to this House with a new Bill to change it.  If the procedures laid down in regulations, whether they are made by the Minister or the Authority, do not work or are deficient in some way either the Minister or the Authority can change them and do so very expeditiously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply briefly to the points made by the Minister.  Amendment No. 21 is in no way analagous to the type of material in the rules of court This amendment deals with the net specific point of crucial importance which goes to the root of the matter, notification to members of the public that an important application is pending.  This is not the kind of matter dealt with in rules of court.  Different matters are dealt with in rules of court.  I agree with the Minister's general proposition that the matters dealt with in rules of court are not appropriate to general legislation but this is a very special matter which goes to the root of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that his objective here is to try save costs and that there would be a multiplicity of expenses incurred if all these applications had to be advertised.  I want to make two comments in reply to that.  First, the cost of putting these advertisements in the newspapers would rest with each applicant and not with the Authority or the State.  No doubt the Authority will charge an appropriate fee when each application for a licence is made to them.  That fee will take account of the fact that advertisements are necessary and the Authority may prescribe that the advertisement has to be placed by the <Col N="1725" /> applicant rather than the Authority.  It would be a mirror image of the situation which applies under the planning legislation where, on each planning application, an advertisemet has to be placed in the newspapers.  What is the purpose of that?  It is not to boost the revenue of the newspapers.  It is for a very important purpose &mdash; it is so that people who may have an objection to a planning application will know about it and can lodge their objection with the local authority, the planners, who will know about the objection and take it into account before reaching their decision.  It would seem very strange in the planning context also if the planning Acts provided that the local authority could only publish notice of a planning application after they had made their decision.  Would it be an answer by the Minister for the Environment in that case to say people can appeal the decision to An Bord Pleanála? That is not the point; the point is that it must be open to every person to make their objections known before a decision is made.  There would be no extra costs involved in this.  Indeed it would be the reverse.  The expense involved in putting a notice in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> and the newspapers would be a discipline on would-be applicants and put a cost on them which would very effectively avoid frivolous, unnecessary multitudinous applications beings made, which the Minister seems to think may well happen.  The financial constraint of the advertisements would stop that.  If one is talking about costs, what about the cost of a High Court appeal?  Where does this come in in comparison with the cost of a newspaper advertisements?  The two just do not bear comparison.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not prepared to give an undertaking to the House that regulations will be brought in which will require notification to interested third parties by advertisements before a decision is made.  He seems to think that the Authority will make such a provision. When the Authority look to section 4 (5) they may very well decide that they will not do that for the simple reason that the Oireachtas clearly signalled to them that <Col N="1726" /> they are not to do it.  They may well argue that the Oireachtas had carefully considered the question as to who was to be given prior notification &mdash; it was not put aside or left for later decision by the Oireachtas but was specifically dealt with under section 4 (5) which provides that any Minister of the Government can be invited by the Authority to make representations. They may well say that if the Oireachtas wanted to have interested third parties involved in this, they would have said so and had dealt only with the issue of an invitation to any minister of the Government to make representations. I have no objection to that proposal, it is prefectly in order.  I take the Minister's point about public policy. I do not think it will have a direct bearing on the judicial decision the Authority will have to make, nonetheless it is acceptable enough.  The point I make must stand up. The minister's response is indefensible and makes no sense.  It does not involve a whole rigmarole of procedural regulations but deals with one very clear point.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to my amendment No. 26 in which I propose that when a licence is refused, notification of that fact should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  The Bill as it stands provides that only when an application is granted is it published It makes no provision for publication in the event of a refusal, but it seems that a refusal is also a matter of public interest. It is a matter in which many people and companies would be interested as regards setting the parameters and guidelines for the future.  That is something that should not be kept secret but should logically and reasonably be in the public knowledge.</P>

They are important amendments and the Minister has not lessened their importance by his contribution but has underlined the necessity for them.  The Minister stated something twice today as his view and that he understood it was a view shared by the Authority also.  Perhaps I misunderstood him but the Authority are not <Col N="1727" /> set up yet.  This Bill proposes the setting up of the Competition Authority.  I do not known who the Minister is referring to when he says his view is shared by the Authority.  Perhaps they are set up and he does not want to admit it here.  Are they set up?</P>

      <P>The Minister said in defence of his position in refusing to accept these amendments that the Authority would not be doing their job in investigating an application for an exemption unless they discussed it with interested bodies or people who might of affected by that decision.  Why does that not apply with regard to Ministers of the Government?  If the Minister has so much confidence in the Authority doing their job what is the necessity for susection (5)?  That subsection states that: &ldquo;the Authority may invite any Minister of the <Col N="1728" /> Government concerned with the matter to offer such observations as he may wish to make&rdquo;.  If a Minister of the Government in conserned surely the Authority would be doing their job by inviting him to make his observations regardless of subsection (5).</P>
      <P>The Aythority will legitimately take the view as stated by Deputy Taylor today, that the Minister would want them to consult only one person, that is, a Minister of the Government.  They would not consider themselves obliged under the legislation establishing them &mdash; even though they have been already established before the legislation was introduces &mdash; to consult anybody else who may have observations to make.  As for the Minister's rather specious argument about the cost, that is childish.  The cost of a half day in the High Court for somebody who is interested in the matter and feels it necessary to pursue their arguments in that court, if they have the chance to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The cost of half a day in the High Court would pay for an advertisement in every newspaper in the country and in Europe.  The Minister's argument is not a serious one and I am surprised he made it.  The Minister has given no explanation as to why he thinks an advertisement in one paper would be sufficient rather then in two.  He is creating the impression that in some way the Authority's works must be kept hidden. I am sure that is not the Minister's intention but that is certainly the impression that has been given here today.</P>

      <P>On the confidentiality question, that is covered by paragraph 9 of the Schedule.  The Deputy need have no concern on that point.  In appropriate cases the question on confidentiality is carefully observed, in the publication of reports and so on, and that is what is envisaged in this Bill.  In so far as the other general points are concerned I do not want to reopen this discussion again but we are making advertising in newspapers compulsory.  How much more public can you make something?  I say that in reply to Deputy Barry's allegation that everything in the Bill is secretive. Deputy Taylor thinks that because somebody starts some from of procedure and does not advertise it in the paper there is some new horrendous practice growing up here.  Every day hundreds and maybe thousands of cases are brought to court and nobody knows about them except the parties concerned. You do not give notice of the fact that you are issuing a plenary summons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's point on amendment No. 26 that when an application is refused that should be advertised also, I do not see the need to do that because nobody is affected by it.  You are back at square one and the ordinary law applies.  There is no derogation. Nobody is affected.  I do not think <Col N="1731" /> that that fact needs to be advertised.  The Government are not seeking to become a benevolent society for newspapers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by the Minister about amendment No. 26, but he did not really deal with my concerns. The Minister said earlier that he fears the possibility of a multitude of applications, many of them repetitious. If an application on a particular issue is made and is refused but nobody knows about it, there may well be a multitude of people who keep on making applications <Col N="1732" /> without knowing that application for that particular item has already been made and refused.  On the other hand, if applicants are notified once that an application for a particular issue was made and refused they will not waste their time or their expense on further advertisments, more work, or whatever by making another application, knowing that they would be backing a loser because an application for that item had already been made and refused.  That was my thinking in the tabling of that particular amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(9)  If representations are received by the Authority from any person to <Col N="1735" /> the effect that anything prohibited by this section is occurring, the Authority, unless they consider the representations to be frivolous, shall carry out an investigation.  Where the Authority holds an investigation it shall report thereon to the Minister and if the finding of the Authority is to the effect that anything prohibited by this section may have been breached, the Authority may, if they consider it appropriate to do so, initiate any proceedings provided for in this Act.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is simply to give a role to the Authority to investigate representations made to them to the effect that this legislation is being breached on a particular occasion is being breached on a particular occasion and to give the Authority power to do something about that if, having carried out their investigation, they find that the legislation has, in fact, been breached.  To leave the enforcement of this most important measure entirely in the private domain may result in a widespread abuse of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In many cases private individuals or small companies who might be adversely affected may not have the resources available to them to take proceedings in the High Court, with a risk of an appeal to the Supreme Court, and all that that entails.  Even if they had the resources they might not be prepared to risk it. Why should they?  These measures will be law and it should not be the role of private citizens to enforce them.</P>
    <P>It would be a serious matter to have breaches of sections 4 and 6, which are crucial.  I am providing a very obvious, simple attempt to remedy it.  It provides that where any citizen, small company or whatever finds that the legislation is being breached and does not have resources to go to the High Court he or she may point out what they have discovered to the Authority and ask them to carry out an investigation.  If the Authority decide that the complaint is frivolous they may ignore it; on the other hand, if they decide it warrants looking into they will carry <Col N="1736" /> out an investigation and report their findings to the Minister.  If their finding is that matters prohibited by this section have been breached and that nothing is being done about it, the Authority may initiate any of the various forms of proceedings provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>If we are realistic in bringing in a Competition Bill to try to control anti-competitive and concerted practices we must ask ourselves if we are being realistic and practical about it.  In some cases multinational companies will have the resources and be prepared to go to the High Court and the Supreme Court to seek injuctions or to get damages. However, that category will be few and far between, for the most part the people adversely affected will be the ordinary citizens and small companies.  They will not initiate proceedings in the High Court even though they might be losing quite a bit by not doing so.  They just would not be able to do it as the legal aid resources are laughable and would be of no help to a person in that position.  Will we bring in a law just for the look of the thing? The practicality of enforcing it has not been addressed and, apart from the case of the big multinationals or companies who might be adversely affected, the only other occasional case is where the Minister might decide to go to the High Court for a breach of the Bill.  Those kinds of cases would be few and far between, indeed it is very unlikely that such cases would be reluctant to become involved in that kind of investigation even if he had the resources.  His Department probably do not have such resources in these days of cutbacks.</P>
    <P>We must try to devise some likely method under which the Bill will be shown the respect it deserves when enacted.  The only way to do that is to say that the Authority are the experts in this line of country and that where it is obvious a breach has taken place they will be empowered to ensure that the Bill is complied with on foot of complaints made to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything <Col N="1737" /> Deputy Taylor said.  In relation to two previous amendments the Minister referred to the cost as being a reason for not doing things.  However, apparently he does not have the same concern for the people affected by this legislation. When we debeated the first amendment to the Bill a week ago we pointed out the horrendous cost associated with an individual or a small firm in seeing that this Bill is complied with because their only recourse is to the High Court.  I do not know the costs involved in going to the High Court but I am sure they are very sustantial and far beyond the means of an ordinary small trader, enterprise or individual.  The Minister should show the same concern for the people affected by this legislation in regard to costs as he showed in relation to the cost of putting an advertisement in the newspaper. I support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to hear that from Deputy Barry because he spent a lot of this debate telling us that there was too much enforcement in the Bill and that everybody was on the backs of small traders and so on.  If his amendment was accepted an incredible scenario would be generated because any member of the public, according to this amendment, would be able to make a complaint to the Authority.  If that happened the Authority, unless they considered the representations to be frivolous, shall carry out an investigation.  If any evidence were disclosed they would then be expected to take proceedings.  The Deputy did not say whether those proceedings would be civil or criminal, the only proceedings provided for in this Bill are civil and it would be very difficult for someone else.  There is a provision that, in certain instances, the Minister may do that but it would be very hard to do it otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite Deputies Barry and Taylor to consider whether they think it appropriate that any member of the public &mdash; there are three and a half million people in the country &mdash; including competitors of the company concerned could go to <Col N="1738" /> the Authority and make a request.  As long as they could show they were serious and that it was not just a vaxatious, frivolous matter the Authority would be compelled by this, if it was law, to hold an investigation.  That would be totally unreasonable and most unfair to companies who may be acting in the best of good faith.  It would be most unreasonable to allow their direct competitors, who have a vested interest in trying to put them out of business, to compel the Authority to hold a major inquiry on their request.  That would be gross over-enforcement and it would be very unfair to the company concerned.  I am sure that when the Deputies reflect on the matter they will not proceed with the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing is sure, without this amendment being written into the Bill there will be gross under-enforcement, indeed non-enforcement, because there will be nobody around to enforce it.  Will the Minister enlighten the House in relation to who will enforce it?</P>
      <P>I am not talking about a major inquiry, my amendment does not say that.  It says the Authority can carry out an investigation; they will have officers who can make the inquiries and investigations and if they find that the Act has been breached they may &mdash;&ldquo;may&rdquo; is the word I used advisedly, not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;&mdash; bring proceedings open to them under the Bill. Is the Minister content that the Bill should be breached? Is he happy about the fact that companies may look askance on what he is introducing in the Bill? Does he not care whether it is enforced? Would he agree that if an officer of the Authority on carrying out an investigation finds that the legislation has been breached something ought to be done about it?  The Minister has said that the Authority will find it difficult to initiate proceedings, but where is the difficulty? There is none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 6 he lays out the remedies that will be open to an aggrieved person and these include an injuction.  What will there be to stop the Authority from <Col N="1739" /> obtaning an injuction?  A private individual will be able to seek one.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, justice like the Ritz Hotel is open to everyone.  If, as a result of a concerted practice, 5p is added to the price of a gallon of petrol, who will take it upon themselves to go to the High Court with all the risks that involves?  If we are realists, we should not bring in legislation unless there is a reasonable prospect that it will be enforced and observed.  There is no point setting up an authority if they are going to sit back in their armchairs and adjudicate on licence and exemption applications.  They will have to be prepared to do more than that if they are to be worth their salt. Members of the public and small companies will require official assistance if the Bill is to have any effect in many cases.</P>
    <P>Is do not think the Bill will produce any incredible scenarios.  If people are affected by unfair and concerted practices and anti-competitive measures and if no one in authority bothers about it, that will be an incredible scenario. Unwarranted and unfounded complaints may be made to the Authority.  Unwarranted complaints have been made against the Garda Síochána from time to time, but that is no reason for saying one should not have that right.</P>
    <P>I worded the amendment extremely carefully.  If the Authority come to the conclusion that a complaint is unwarranted or frivolous they need not do anything about it, but if they decide there is something to it, they will send out one of their officers to check it.  If he finds that no action is warranted, that should be the end of the matter but, on the other hand, if he finds that there is something to it the House will be secure in the knowledge that the ordinary members of the public will be protected.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to provide protection for substantial traders but we do not need to worry about them as they are well able to look after themselves.  They will be in a position to go to the High Court but the ordinary citizen and the small trader will require, as always, the assistance of <Col N="1740" /> one of the State agencies in securing the protection being granted to them under this Bill.  Having regard to the absence of a proper legal aid system the only way this can be done is to give an enforcement role of some description to the Authority in a careful, modulated way.  That is what I am attempting to do in this amendment. It is essential that this amendment be accepted if the Bill is to protect the small trader.  If it is not accepted, there will be no practical effective remedy open to him if he is kicked in the teeth by unscrupulous people who disregard the Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree with most of what Deputy Taylor has said.  The Minister is being unfair in not giving much thought to the amendments.  People are concerned that the only person who will be able to intiate an investigation will be the Minister and that the Authority will not have the power to do so.  It is conceivable that at some stage the Minister will be asked to request the Authority to initiate an investigation into an unfair practice, but the Minister of the day may prefer, for political reasons, not to do so.</P>
      <P>It is odd that the Minister referred to the question of cost because if an individual or an undertaking object to the granting of a licence, they will be able to bring the matter to the High Court.  All Deputy Taylor is seeking to do is to ensure that an individaual who belivies that the conditions attached to a licence issued are not being complied with, will be allowed to take the matter to the High Court in the same way as a firm who object to the Authority granting a licence or an exemption will be able to take a matter to that court.  It is perfectly reasonable that an individual or small company who has been wronged should be able to go to the Authority pointing out that the conditions attached to a licence issued to firm X 12 months previouly are not being complied with and to ask them what they are going to do about it.  In those circumstances the Authority should be given the power to intiate an investigation into the complaint.</P>

      <P>There is a danger that this legislation will be over-politicised having regard to the fact that the Authority will be able to invite the Minister only to make a submission or give his observations in relation to an application for a licence.  However, if Deputy Taylor's amendment is accepted, persons other than the Minister will be able to seek an investigation into anti-competitive practices. The Minister should be well aware of the dangers of relying too much on Ministers to initiate inquiries.  I would ask him therefore to consider accepting an amendment which would give the Authority the power to initiate an investigation into any matter.</P>

It would be impossible to allow a competitor to come in at the drop of a hat and cause an investigation to be held into the affairs of a competitor.  This would result in people being put out of business unfairly, unnecessarily and inappropriately.</P>
      <P>I would point out to Deputy Hogan that we are still discussing section 4 and that the investigation only relates to the matters referred to in the section and not to some of the matters mentioned by him.  The Minister's power to ask the Authority to hold an investigation relates to the question of the abuse of the dominant position and not to the question of any competitive practices.  It does not seem appropriate that one should need to hold an inquiry into anti-competitive practices because the remedy is there without resort to any Minister or the Authority.  The remedy is in the hands of the aggrieved party to take proceedings. They have never had that remedy before and I think it is a valuable asset that they have it now.</P>

      <P>In page 5, lines 38 to 40, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>(1)  Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the State shall be prohibited in so far as it may affect trade.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>I think the wording of my amendment is clearer than the wording of the original text in section 5 (1) and of the Minister's draft amendment.  My wording is as close as I can get to the wording in the EC Directive.

      <P>In amendment No. 32 I propose to delete section 5 (2) (b) which states &ldquo;limiting production, markets or other technical developments to the prejudice of consumers;&rdquo;.

      <P>The amendments in my name, amendments Nos. 29 and 30, clarify the wording that is needed, particularly by reference to Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  I think they are more suitable than amendment No. 28.  It is important for the sake of consistency with Article 86 of the Treaty that in appropriate cases the wording used be as close <Col N="1743" /> to the Treaty as possible and, therefore, it is necessary that the words &ldquo;or in a substantial part of the State&rdquo; be included. It is important for the efficacy of the new system that it applies to all undertakings, not just those operating at national level in the country as a whole.  A dominant undertaking in a regional market may be in a position to damage competition in that same market and should not be left free to do so.  The subsection including the two amendments in my name, if accepted, would then read as follows:</P>
      <P>Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in trade for any goods or services in the State or in a substantial part of the State is prohibited. </P>
      <P>This wording is different from that in section 4 which refers to any part of the State rather than a &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; part of the State.  A choice had to be made in respect of the wording of section 4 because the precise text of Article 85 referred to the Common Market whereas there is no real option in regard to the wording of section 5.</P>

      <P>The wording is different from the wording in section 4 because that refers to any part of the State rather than to a substantial part of the State. The reason that section 4 had to be changed from the wording in the Treaty was that it was referring to trade in the Common Market and trade between member states with a view to achieving the Common Market, and that does not apply in section 5.  That is why the wording is different.  The words &ldquo;a substantial part of&rdquo; appear there because they appear in Article 86.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am becoming more and more confused.  The Minister can accept amendment No. 32 in my name because the wording is taken from the Treaty of the European Community.  Who decides that the word &ldquo;other&rdquo; should be put in and that the word &ldquo;developments&rdquo; was in the plural?  It seems an extraordinary waste of the time of the parliamentary draftsman and Members of this House. However, to get back to the more substantial matter, I do not understand the reason for the reference to a &ldquo;substantial part of the State&rdquo;.  It appears to me that the intention is quite different in the EC where we are talking about trade between member states and, therefore, the reference to &ldquo;a substantial part of the State&rdquo; must apply because there could be a distortion of competition between the northern part of Italy and the western part of France and in that case you would be talking about a substantial part of the state in the Community.  If there is an abuse of the dominant position in part of the country, whether it is Tralee, Dublin or Cork, it is within the State and we do not need to qualify it further with the words &ldquo;a substantial part of the State&rdquo;. The offence is committed within the state and the words &ldquo;in a substantial part of the State&rdquo; are superfluous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to carry that blindly from the Treaty and we have not done it in other instances where the application is totally different.  It is necessary in the European context to refer to the dominant position in a substantial part of the State where one is talking about inter-state trade but in this context we are not talking about inter-state trade and if there is an abuse of a dominant position in the State we do not have to say it is in <Col N="1745" /> a substantial part of the state or the State itself because the offence is the same under this law which applies to all the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry appears not to understand what the section intends and proposes and what Article 86 also makes clear.  We have to distinguish between an undertaking which has a dominant position in trade or services in the State and an undertaking which has a dominant position in trade or services in a substantial part of the State.  Let us take an example nearest Deputy Barry's heart.</P>

He could say he was not dominant in that trade in the State because he did not trade significantly in the other three provinces. It would be wrong if he were to get out of it on that basis.  We are talking about dominance in the State or in a substantial part of the State.  It is defined in that way in order to avoid a situation where somebody could be accused of abusing a dominant position in a very small part of the State, let us say a small town in west Cork.  It would be unreasonable to subject somebody whose geographical area of activity was very small to these kinds of rules.  The section does not apply to somebody who is dominant in only a small part of the State.</P>

      <P>I am following what was initiated by the Minister.  If Deputy Barry were dominant in the tea trade in Munster and were abusing that position, would he contravene the Bill?  Is Minister a substantial part of the State within the meaning of the subsection?  It is open to argument.  What proportion of the State is Minister?  How does it compare with the State as a whole as to land area and population?  Perhaps it represents a quarter of the State.  Would dominance in a quarter of the State be a substantial part? I do not think so but I could be entirely wrong.  My view is that a court would not hold that dominance in one quarter of the State would represent dominance in a substantial part of the State.  What proportion would have to be involved to contravene this section?  It is woolly and vague.  There may be difficulty in trying to make it more specific, but some attempt should be made.  Otherwise there will be lengthy argument in the High Court and Supreme Court.  Why should we allow that to happen when legislation is at the formative stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister excludes the words &ldquo;in any part of the State&rdquo; and puts in the words &ldquo;a substantial part of the State&rdquo; he is saying in effect that in an insubstantial part of the State&mdash;let us say a county or half a county, leaving aside Dublin &mdash; it is in order not only to have a dominant position in a trade or service but it is also in order to abuse it.  The basis of that argument would be that the abuse of the dominant position is only in an insubstantial part of the State.  Is the Minister <Col N="1747" /> saying that it is satisfactory and would not breach the Bill if there were abuse of a dominant position in an insubstantial part of the State?  That would appear to be the position.</P>
    <P>Maybe the Minister is happy with that and the Bill is not intended to cover abuse of a dominant position in an insubstantial part of the State.  If it is intended to deal with it, as I think it should, then the wording used in section 4 would be better and the prohibition should apply to any part of the State without the limitation that it must take place in a substantial part of the State, whatever the courts may interpret that to mean.</P>

According to the 1972 Act they are entitled to sell electrical equipment.  Their trade increased substantially between 1985 and 1990.  In 1985 the turnover in those shops was £9 million and in 1990 it was £44 million.

      <P>I support Deputy Taylor's remarks that the courts will have a field day interpreting this legislation.  &ldquo;Dominant position&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill either.  Explaining &ldquo;a very substantial part&rdquo;, the Minister gave as an example a dominant position in the tea market in Munster, alluding to Deputy Barry. Would that form a dominant position in a substantial part of the State?  The criteria and guidelines we use are very important in defining a substantial part of the State. The County of Dublin in population terms is equivalent to Munster.  Therefore, what is &ldquo;a substantial part of the State&rdquo;?  Do we mean territorially, in population terms or what?  We have no guidelines in relation to this definition. This creates further uncertainty and further wrangling which would add unnecessary costs in a court procedure. Closer alignment with the wording in the Treaty would eliminate that uncertainty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to Deputy Hogan, he is complaining that these phrases are not defined.  They are all defined at great length in the decisions of the European Court and in the procedures of the Commission.  They do not have to be set out here again.  As I explained this morning, the relevant decisions of the court are adopted so far as this country is concerned by Statutory Instrument of 29 December 1972.  They have been argued before the European Court on innumerable occasions and they have been defined and refined there.  That is the advantage of using this kind of phraseology, because it has been defined so frequently and it is well known to <Col N="1749" /> lawyers and traders who have had to deal with it so often.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy would like some kind of definition expressed in percentage terms or something of that kind.  In the 1978 Act we made the mistake of trying to define &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; in percentage terms, and it was a very foolish move.  I know from my experience in the past two years just how foolish it was, because somebody felt he was entitled to ride roughshod over everyone in this country and over the public authorities simply because he was, in percentage terms, just below the statutorily defined monopoly figure, even though he had a monopoly. He had what would in terms of this Bill be called the dominant position.</P>
      <P>The dominant position is defined in so far as it relates to each trade and each sector and, of course, it will very greatly. Similarly in regard to geographical areas as to what is a substantial part and so on, that, again, will vary according to each trade.  If you were to set out a requirement that you had to be dominant or trading in a particular number of counties in Ireland, you could not apply that definition to everything as Deputy Hogan would wish.  In many counties there is no trade in certain matters and there is no provision of certain services.</P>
      <P>While you might say in the definition section that one county was insubstantial, when it comes to Dublin that one county and city alone constitute in population terms one third of the country.  Therefore, to claim that one county is an insubstantial part would immediately run you into serious difficulty.  That is why it is better to leave it to the kind of definitions that have been worked out over the last 35 years in the European Court which meet these kinds of circumstances and are adaptable to each type of case.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) below cost selling where it is considered to be tantamount to unfair trading,&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 sets out to list the particular areas that would constitute an abuse of a dominant position and the Minister may argue that subsection (2) (a) caters for the import of my amendment.  I am of the view that it is still necessary to specifically advert to the particular abuse of below cost selling.  It is necessary to include as an example of abuse of a dominant position expressly in the Bill this form of manipulation of sources of supply.  I say that because the Minister has stated in respect of discussions we have had on other amendments that 99 per cent of companies would not find themselves in this situation.  We are talking here not merely about a company that has a dominant <Col N="1752" /> position but a company that is engaged in abuse of that dominant position.</P>
    <P>Below cost selling is a form of abuse that we encounter from time to time.  We have so encountered it in recent times with adverse implications for employment, manipulation of the market to the detriment of people working elsewhere; people have been put out of work in the bakery trade and unquestionably this device is used, for example, in the grocery business by the large multiples who can afford to take a loss in a particular product in order to squeeze the market unfairly to affect small businesses who may be relying on that product or suppliers who are forced to produce it at a manifestly uncompetitive price.  I am of the view that this matter ought to be expressly provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given us any commitment in respect of the restrictive practices order in the grocery trade.  If I recall correctly, he said that depending on what comes out of the investigation it may well be that it would be continued, albeit amended.  That, presumably, is still the position.  Generally speaking, those who work in the trade and who are similarly concerned are anxious that it continue to apply in some fashion or another.  The position would be strengthened if the Minister were prepared to take this amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 33 in my name is also on the same lines, though more extensive than that of Deputy Rabbitte and for that reason I support what Deputy Rabbitte has said.  When we discussed amendment No. 3 or 4 the Minister said that his amendment No. 1 was intended to keep the situation frozen until he sees the result of the Fair Trade Commission's report on the grocery trade which is due during the summer.  He will then consider what action he should take. If he wants to amend that order it will come before the House and if he just wants to negative it, it need not come before the House.  This would result in the type of chaos and the job losses we <Col N="1753" /> saw a few years ago before the introduction of that order in 1987.  I do not have to remind the House of the type of activities engaged in at that time where one supermarket chain went out of existence. Some people attempted to make the argument at that stage that this was the result of competition and that when the kitchen got too hot they could not stand the heat.  Nobody would argue with that if the heat remained inside the kitchen after that but what happened was that that man invested money in a chain of supermarkets.  He was engaged in a very severe form of under-cost selling with another much bigger and much stronger competitior and he lost the battle and his money.  He was not the only person who lost out; the supplier to that company also lost out.  It is winding to a close now as to how much will be paid. Many suppliers to that chain of supermarket companies lost considerably and their employees lost their jobs as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>And their pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Their pensions were lost also.  Many of the smaller suppliers to that chain of supermarkets have all gone out of business and their employees have lost their jobs.  One cannot look at it coldly and say it is A v. B and there will be no consequences if A loses.  There are other consequences down the road.  I understand that as a result of the liquidation of the supermarket chain the payment of the creditors will be somewhere in the region of 10p in the pound.  There are considerable financial losses to the suppliers of that company, and as Deputy Rabbitte said, the employees of that company not only lost their jobs but their pensions.</P>
      <P>Nobody wishes to ban under-cost selling in areas where it is clearly necessary, for example, in the area of fresh fruit and vegetables.  A trader must get rid of such goods if they are in danger of being held too long but that is not what we are talking about here.  What I am talking about can be summed up in my amendment No. 33 (3) (b) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> In examining `below cost selling' of an `unfair trading' nature [that is the kernel of my amendment] the Authority must have regard among other aspects not only to the interests of consumers at the point in time in question... </P>
    <P>It was clearly in the interests of the consumer at the point in time in question when the supermarket, to which I have referred, went into liquidation in 1987, because cheap prices were available in both supermarkets for a limited period. That was not the situation afterwards. Amendment No. 33 (3) (b) continues as follows:</P>
    <P>...but also to the likely state and development of competition and the future interests of consumers as the consequences of `below cost selling' are experienced over a reasonable time horizon. </P>
    <P>If you have two firms engaged in a war of prices and if one goes into liquidation and ultimately goes out of business then one would want to be rather naive to expect that prices would remain at that level or even at the level at which both were selling prior to the commencement of the price war in the future.  I am asking that the Authority examine not only the effect on consumer prices at the time of the below cost selling incident but also in the future to see whether the elimination of one competitor will be in the long term interests of the consumer, and clearly to my mind it will not be.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of a particular product where a supermarket chain would carry thousands of lines, broken up into different departments.  One of those departments decides to deliberately engage in below cost selling against a much smaller specialised competitor and put him out of business, for example, an off sales wine merchant next door to a big supermarket in any part of the country.  The supermarket chain cuts the price of a range of goods.  It has been said and has been generally accepted that most customers remember only the prices. <Col N="1755" /> of 20, 25 or 30 items.  When the supermarket chain cuts the prices of perhaps 25 of the more popular lines in their store and draws the trade away from the specialist off-licence merchant next door in the high sales period of, say, mid-November to Christmas, the result is that if that goes on for two or three years the off licence will have to close down and the supermarket chain will get all the trade in that area for that product and will not continue to sell at those predator prices but will put the prices up to a marginal return to the supermarket chain in excess of what they could do if they had the competition.</P>
    <P>The Minister is professing to encourage competition by not banning below price selling but what he is doing in the long term is eliminating competition.  Even though there may be some short term benefits from this, it is not, as they say, the life of trade or in the long term interests of consumers.</P>
    <P>I also propose that in examining below cost selling activities the Authority should have regard to competition within the sector in which the supplier and/or retailer exists.  At Question Time about a month ago and again on an earlier section today, the Minister said that if the supplier to a supermarket chain is being damaged he has recourse to the High Court. I could refer to other examples but this is the one which is most often in the public eye.  The option of going to the High Court so that the abuse of a dominant position by a supermarket chain can be redressed is not an option open to suppliers except on paper.  In the real world suppliers cannot do this.  Deputy Taylor scoffed at me earlier when I referred to a half day in the High Court. He was probably right, there is no such thing as a half day in the High Court.  A case will usually be in the High Court for three days and will be extremely expensive. A small supplier to a big chain will certainly not be in a position from a financial point of view to take a supermarket chain to which he is supplying goods to court on the grounds that they are abusing their dominant position.  If <Col N="1756" /> he wins the case he will be congratulated on doing a great job but will be told by the supermarket chain not to ring them. In other words, he will lose his customers. Therefore, this is not a real option open to suppliers.</P>
    <P>I also propose that the Authority examine the implications for suppliers and/or retailers specialising in a product or product grouping subject to below cost selling.  This is the point I was making in regard to the abuse of a dominant position by a supermarket chain.  If, say, they adopt as a predatory price practice in regard to specialised items such as spirits, they would wipe out off-licences and that would not be in the long term interests of consumers.</P>
    <P>This area has been a matter of much public debate for many years.  There is a legitimate volume of opinion, though I do not agree with it, that large supermarkets should be let at one another &mdash; let the best dog jump the ditch, let the strongest man win, etc., are the sort of clichés which are trotted out.  That appears to be an attractive option on the surface and in the consumers' interest but it would not be so in reality.  If this Competition Bill genuinely deals with competition, it must encourage competition.  I agree with the points made earlier by the Minister in this regard.  On, I think, Second Stage the Minister said that America and Germany are two very good examples of countries where competition is encouraged.  These countries have legislation which ensures that competition is open and that there is genuine competition between enterprises. I strongly support that objective.</P>
    <P>Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome provide that part of the objective of the competition policy of the European Community must be to ensure that competition is fair, is not used for predatory purpose and that a strong dominant position in the marketplace is not used to wipe out competitors.  This should be part of our concern also.  We must ensure that the legislation we pass will be in the long term interests of the consumer and that unfair practices in trading such as price rigging to keep prices up are forbidden and prohibited.  We must also ensure that <Col N="1757" /> unfair trading where one supplier to a market abuses his dominant position by undercutting prices or entering into agreements with other suppliers to the extent that other competitors or potential competitors are wiped out is also prohibited. This is as much a part of competition policy as the other matters we debated previously.  When we talk about competition it is important that we do not talk only about competition in prices and services.  We also need to ensure that competition does not allow unfair trading in any respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Barry's amendment No. 33 which deals with below cost selling.  As Deputy Barry said, there have been many inquiries and public statements about the abuse of a dominant position by large supermarket chains and the effect this has on small shopkeepers involved in the same trade.</P>
      <P>It is very important that we look at the effects of this practice on competition in the long term.  I believe in a society where consumers get the best value for money and the best service possible.  However, over the past number of years larger firms have tended to reduce their prices at certain times of the year when consumers are willing to spend money, for example, Christmas time or summer time.  Small shopkeepers are left in the position that they cannot compete with these larger shops.  If this practice is allowed to continue, small shopkeepers will be put out of business and the larger stores will have a monopoly in the market, thus enabling them to increase their prices again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This also has a knock-on effect on employment.  We have to take into account the unemployment crisis in Ireland.  The Taoiseach does not seem to believe there is any crisis in regard to unemployment but I think most people would agree that our main objective should be the provision and maintenance of jobs.  If the problem of below cost <Col N="1758" /> selling is not tackled, our level of unemployment will continue to rise.  As I have said, larger firms only keep prices down for as long as it suits them and when their competitors are forced out of business they increase their prices.  This is not in the best interests of consumers or of the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support Deputy Barry's amendment.  Unfair practices in trading are unjust and uncalled for. Below cost selling has put many family grocers out of business.  The large combines which are selling below cost are throwing a sprat to catch a mackerel &mdash; when one examines the prices they charge for many other products they are as dear as those charged by family grocers. They reduce the price of certain products each week in order to attract customers and in this way they wipe out small grocers in rural villages and towns.</P>
      <P>I have seen in the past decade the demise of the family grocer.  Everybody knows that that individual employed perhaps one or two of his own family and in certain cases two or three other people but that tradition has been completely demolished by those who have been given an opportunity of below cost selling.  That is unfair and is a threat to society.  It is not in the interests of the housewives who buy those products or of any of the people concerned.  It only impedes the creation of jobs, which is of primary importance at present when there are about 250,000 people unemployed.  The supermarkets with all their latest gimmicks should be confined to selling their products at a reasonable price, and under no circumstances should the Minister allow them to sell below cost.  I hope he will take steps in this Bill to prevent that threat to society.  I appeal to him that the housewives be advised to buy Irish products in preference to those mass produced overseas, thereby creating more jobs at home.</P>

      <P>Earlier on I talked of the necessity to include a provision in the Bill that would prohibit unfair practices.  A circular letter from Stock Electricals called <i>The National Campaign for a Fair Deal in Electrical Retailing</i> was released earlier this week.  I am sure that the Minister is familiar with the contents of that letter. If the facts contained in the letter are correct then it seems that it would constitute unfair trading.  The Minister gave an undertaking when the Bill was previously discussed that the ESB would be subject to the conditions of the Bill.  If the Minister is not familiar with the contents of the letter, then I do not want to unnecessarily delay the time of the Committee, but if he is familiar with the details perhaps he could tell me whether or not that involves unfair trading.</P>

      <P>I just want to make a point which I failed to make when discussing the earlier amendments.  The intention behind amendment No. 34 is to cover a store or a supplier who will accept goods at a certain price provided one does not supply anyone else in that neighbourhood or, to go back to something that we were disputing earlier, in a substantial part of the State.  That would constitute unfair trading.</P>
      <P>There was an example of this last month when one large supermarket chain failed to get supplies of milk because there were conditions attached to supplying milk to them.  One cannot tell a supermarket store we will only supply our product if it is sold at a certain price. That is one of the things my amendment No. 34 would seek to prohibit.</P>
      <P>The other thing my amendment seeks to cover is something that was quite common some time ago but is not quite so common now, that is what was known as &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;.  That was prohibited under the Grocery Order, 1987.  Before that prohibition, suppliers could only get their goods on the shelves of department stores or supermarket chains if they made what was called a contribution towards shelf space or &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;.  This Bill is concerned about promoting competition but it should also promote fair trading with regard to retailing.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy is trying to get at is largely covered by section 5 (2) (d).  A point that should be borne in mind is that all abuses of a dominant position are prohibited.  The partial list in subsection (2) is taken directly from Article 86, where the examples were given.  They were given <Col N="1765" /> without prejudice to the generality of what goes before them.  It would be unwise to add to the list in Article 86, because if we do, things that are not specifically put into the list will then come to be regarded as being not really abuses of a dominant position.  That would be a pity.  The beauty of the prohibition of the abuse in subsection (1) is that it is all embracing and covers every abuse of the dominant position.</P>

      <P>Yes, in the State or a substantial part of the State.  I am reluctant to add to, or to agree to, others adding cases because all of us could add ten or 20 different cases if we wanted to, but the difficulty would be that the ones we do not include would then tend to be excluded.  That would be wrong.  It is better to have the all embracing one, and have only some generalised examples as taken from Article 86 of the Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says and in large measure I agree with it. However, we run up against the snag to which Deputy Taylor just referred in relation to &ldquo;a substantial part of the State&rdquo;.  That makes it necessary to put in another example as well.  Some time earlier in the afternoon I gave the example of a supermarket chain in a country town putting an off-licence out of business.  That could hardly be described as a substantial part of the State but it is unfair trading under the sort of definition I am talking about here.  I am not sure if that situation is catered for because of the conditionality attached to the words &ldquo;in a substantial part of the State&rdquo; and I am not sure if the Authority can deal with it for that reason.  If the Minister gives me an assurance that they <Col N="1766" /> can do so, I will withdraw my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am under a misapprehension here, but it seems that even if one included in subsection (2) some additional items, such as below cost selling, they would be of no value unless it was being carried on in a substantial part of the State.  If one includes an additional item under subsection (2), there seems to be some impression that it would be caught even if it was in an insubstantial part of the State.  That is not so because if one looks at subsection (2) carefully it is really only a definition of the word &ldquo;abuse&rdquo;.  For anything to be caught by subsection (2) one first must come within the ambit of subsection (1) which is that the abuse of the dominant position must take place either in the entirely of the State or in a substantial part of the State. If it does not, then whether one is contravening paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) does not matter.  It does not make any difference because it is only a definition of the word &ldquo;abuse&rdquo;.  If any of those things that are being spoken about were occuring in what was not a substantial part of the State, that would be all right because the section as a whole would not control it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point I have been trying to make.  Maybe I am misinterpreting the case.  I do not profess to be the last word on it, but it strikes me that subsection (1) is the defining section and that quite clearly says it must be in the State or in a substantial part of the State.  Then it says:</P>
      <P>without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), such abuse... </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Abuse&rdquo; is the word referred to in subsection (1).  That is giving particularity as to what the abuse may be.  That is all it does.  It does not say that any of those items, if contravened in a small part of the State would be caught by that section as a whole.  I do not think it would, but <Col N="1767" /> perhaps I am wrong.  I do not know whether the Minister would agree with that view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it simply happened between two people, or two firms it is not necessarily caught.  If it is a purely localised, almost personalised thing, it would not be caught, but it would not really be a dominant position in those circumstances.  It would simply be competition between two people.</P>

      <P>The Minister's remarks are slightly disturbing.  I referred earlier to a supermarket war about three or four years ago which gave rise to the 1987 order by the Minister banning low cost selling and the effect it has on the firm, creditors and employees.  However, it appears from what the Minister said that because this did not take place in a substantial part of the State, it would not be caught under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, it is not between two chains, it is between a smallish chain in a particular part of the State, Dublin, being taken on by a much bigger store in that area.  I am not familiar with the location of those stores but I think they were confined to the south side of Dublin.  It certainly could not be defined as a substantial part of the State, but the effects were the same on the creditors and the employees of the company involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation to the Minister for his understanding.  Will he answer the two questions I raised earlier?  If a complaint is lodged with the Authority how long will it take for them to act?  If the Authority discovered there was an abuse, how long would it be before the abuse was removed?  I ask these questions because of the actions of a particular company which in 1989 had a turnover in their shops of £9 million, and which in 1990 had increased to £44 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before December 1989 the group of shops had never traded in television sets or video recorders.  However, between then and March 1991 &mdash; a 15 months period &mdash; they had commanded 28 per cent of credit sales for television sets and 35 per cent of credit sales for video recorders in the whole country.  That was shown in a survey carried out by Landsdowne Market Research.  The same group carried out a survey over a two year period ending in March 1991, <Col N="1769" /> and they discovered that the same group of shops had commanded 81 per cent of the credit sales of all electric cookers, 82 per cent of all washing machines and 77 per cent of fridges and freezers in relation to credit sales over a two year period. The company to which I am referring is, of course, the ESB shops.</P>
    <P>In addition to having commandeered such a sizeable portion of the market &mdash; 80 per cent in most credit sales &mdash; they also have the facility of being able to provide easy access to credit.  The two basic questions which a customer is asked when ascertaining his or her creditworthiness is if he or she has been an ESB consumer and if the last six bills were paid.  If the two answers are in the affirmative then it is a matter of filling up a form and credit is organised.</P>
    <P>However, retailers in the same electrical business throughout the country find it difficult to get credit for anyone who wants to raise less than £500.  They must also ask rather embarrassing questions of the customer regarding his weekly wage and his credit-worthiness in the bank.  An ordinary person would prefer not to answer those questions and, therefore, he will not deal with local shops when he can go to the ESB shop and get credit facilities without any great problem or having to answer embarrassing questions.</P>
    <P>The repayments to the ESB shops are facilitated by including them on the ESB bill.  When the bills are sent to various consumers very often brochures are included.  This system of advertising is not available to other retailers.  If this continues, within the next few years there will be a complete take-over of the electrical supply trade by the ESB shops, thereby putting something in the region of 3,500 people out of work.  Unemployment is bad enough as it is without helping a company in a dominant position to abuse that position to the detriment of the other people in the trade.  Will the actions of that company come under this section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The last paragraph of the &ldquo;Shop Electric&rdquo; document is quite <Col N="1770" /> appalling because it involves unfair trading. Appropriating overheads such as the allocation of a clerk's wages, half to sales and half to electricity generation, means that the branch cannot support itself out of sales revenue.  The ultimate violation of monopoly by the ESB, however, must be in their abuse of the billing system.  It is not possible for the ordinary business person to compete with that.  I have received an ESB bill for the first time because I have become a property owner. It is grossly unfair to send an advertisement for white and electrical goods with the bill.  It should not be allowed in any Competition Bill.</P>
      <P>We should also take account of the number of jobs which will be affected.  In Country Leitrim, for example, the service industry provides the largest number of jobs in the country.  It is not possible to compete with the ESB outlets and this situation cannot continue.  This House, and the Minister in particular who has the power to take action quickly to prevent unfair trading.  If this practice continues it will have a detrimental effect on the economy and on businesses throughout the country.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - An Post Viability Plan: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Currie on Tuesday, 11 June 1991:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, being strongly of the belief that the viability plan of An Post has social and economic implications which are unacceptable, would damage the social fabric of rural life, increase the isolation of individuals and disadvantaged groups in both urban and rural areas, would have unacceptable consequences for the range and standard of postal services in that it would in particular close down more than 500 post offices and downgrade 23 company offices in provincial towns, make 1,500 staff redundant, and <Col N="1771" /> replace doorstep delivery with 200,000 roadside post boxes in urban and rural areas, demands that the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications use his powers under Section 110 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 to instruct An Post to withdraw its viability plan and provide an alternative in compliance with the social and household requirements of the 1983 Act.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. a1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;noting that</P>
    <P>(a)  at the initiative of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, talks are now in progress between management and unions about the future of An Post,</P>
    <P>(b)  the predicted losses of An Post in 1992 will, without corrective action, be £14 million, and accumulated losses by end 1992 will be £31 million,</P>
    <P>(c)  the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications has appointed consultants recommended by the National Economic and Social Council (NESC), to carry out a socioeconomic study of the implications for rural communities of An Post's proposals in regard to sub-post offices and roadside letter boxes and also to consider proposing new sources of business for sub-post offices,</P>
    <P>(d)  An Post has deferred implementation of its proposals to regrade some of its own post offices until the Company has had full consultation with relevant bodies from the towns concerned and considered how their concerns may be accommodated within the Company's requirement to become financially viable,</P>
    <P>(e)  following a request from the Minister, the Board of An Post decided to rescind its decision to withdraw from the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme, <Col N="1772" /> supports the Minister's efforts to have management and unions negotiate and agree proposals which will return the post office to at least break even as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this matter last evening I made reference to a number of issues including, for example, the ideological context in which the proposals had been brought forward. I also said that the plan proposed, which was described as a viability plan, made neither economic sense nor was it viable. What I meant by that was that it contained no coherent recognition of the resource of the company, that is, its manpower or womanpower involved in delivering the post.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputies speak about another 1,500 people being added to the unemployment statistics, but that is not the end of the matter because what we have to address is the function of each of those persons.  What is at stake is something very fundamental &mdash; the diminution of a social right and a citizen's right.  I stressed last evening that every citizen of whatever age in no matter how remote a place was entitled to the from of communications that is the post but that is being changed.  What is being said is that the company, who evolved from being a company with a social function to a commercial company, now require the implementation of this viability plan. However, there is no mandate from this House to do that.  The Act which established the new company does not allow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make the following point.  When the city council in Galway, of which I am chairman as Mayor of <Col N="1773" /> Galway and on which all parties are represented, discussed this issue, not one voice was raised against the proposal that the viability plan be rejected because people realised the importance of what was at stake.  Let me say something else which is important.  I have a connection with this problem.  My sister who is in England worked as a postwoman until she began to suffer from arthritis.  Do people around the country want to remember those who travelled over difficult road conditions and in all kinds of weather to deliver post?  Would the planners, if they are interested in planning, look at the demographic statistics which show that the age profile is changing? This has to be looked at in the same way as the emigration statistics &mdash; more older people living alone.  Why not take this network and immense social asset and use it as the basis from which to deliver other services such as caring and commercial services and so on?  That argument has not been made.</P>
    <P>What I have noted in the thinking behind the viability plan is a new breed of Irish people who want to unburden themselves of any kind of social responsibility if no immediate economic benefit is involved.  Let me put it as I put it at the conference of the Communications Workers' Union.  When the rail network was cut back older people were told they would get buses instead of trains but what happened was, in effect, that they were locked in their houses.  For these people the connection with the post person in practical terms is their link with life.  The so-called economic viability proposals are socially destructive and will create more isolation for elderly people.  It might be said that this is not in the realm of reality but will our representatives in Europe not look rather pathetic when they say, having wound up the connections with people in remote areas, that they are looking for something which might assist them?</P>
    <P>There is one final point I would like to make.  I taught economics and commerce for some time, as the Minister knows. In terms of commerce; if one inherits a disposable asset there is a cowardly way <Col N="1774" /> out, that is to sell the asset as quickly as possible and retreat to the little that is left.  In the case we are talking of management lacked courage in making their proposals in that they did not evaluate the potential of their asset.  It is unacceptable that the proposals which have been suggested which, as I said, regard people as being a disposable part of the asset and something that could be got rid of, could be accepted as being interesting.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion that what we all want is to let the field clear, get the plan out of the way and for everybody involved, the community, the workers and management to come up with proposals for the development of what is our communications industry.  We should not get ready to ditch the social aspect so that the little that is left and profitable can be sold on the market place speculatively to people who might be neither Irish nor concerned about a single citizen in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party believe that An Post can be an efficient and viable semi-State body but if this is to happen they must be allowed to diversify, to develop the post GIRO system which has been an international success and to provide a banking service for the community. The Government would be very shortsighted if they were to give the green light to a £20 million or £30 million redundancy package to get rid of perhaps 15,000 workers.  It would be far better if this money was spent in developing the post GIRO service with the profits being used to restore An Post to financial health.  This attack on our postal services follows the savage attacks on local and health services which have been a feature of the term of office of this Government and their predecessors.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Currie for putting this motion before the House and I am delighted to accept the invitation to speak on it which he extended to Fianna Fáil  backbenchers on RTE last Monday night.  I thank him also for giving me and my colleagues the opportunity to say in public what we said when this viability plan was first published by An Post.  Like Deputy O'Donoghue, I am glad that Fine Gael have at last woken up to the implications of the plan. However, I would have to say they were a little bit late because it is two months since the plan was first published.  They suddenly seem to have found that there was a problem and we are now discussing the motion.  Within two or three days <Col N="1776" /> of the plan being published, Fianna Fáil backbenchers were in contact with and in active discussions with the Minister.  I am very pleased to put on record that the Minister responded very quickly to the concerns expressed by us as Fianna Fáil backbenchers.  I congratulate the Minister and thank him for that.  I congratulate him also on the immediate action taken on the proposals which were causing a great deal of concern, especially for rural areas, that is the proposal regarding roadside letter boxes and the possible closure of sub-post offices.  The Minister went further and took action regarding the regarding proposals which he discussed with An Post and they have been withdrawn, temporarily at least until full discussions can take place.</P>
      <P>The Minister also took action when the management of An Post withdrew from the conciliation and arbitration scheme. The Minister should be congratulated on all the negotiations he has conducted over the past number of months and for the way he has cleared the way for union-management meetings which are taking place and which I hope will bring about a change in the viability plan and ensure that An Post operate as a viable semi-State company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the motion before the House and the fact that Fine Gael have not recognised the role the Minister has played and that they do not make any reference to the current talks to try to resolve the differences that exist between unions and management in An Post.  At the very least they could have indicated their support for a non-con-frontational resolution to this matter. There are others, apart from Fine Gael, whose role has been less than honourable, in particular the management of An Post who foisted this plan on everybody without consultation and in the middle of what was a very sensitive period withdrew from the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  I do not know what kind of management would take such action. I question whether they were trying to provoke the workers and consumers even further.  Their motivation would have to <Col N="1777" /> be questioned and their judgement leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>I have to comment also on the role of the communications workers union.  They have not been totally blameless and they have tried to distort the issues involved. Some of their campaigning appears to be politically motivated rather than motivated by their concern for the possible damage to the fabric of rural life.  If they are as concerned as we are on this side of the House about the fabric of rural life and the welfare of the local post workers and post offices which they have been making such a play about, perhaps they could come up with some proposals to cut down on the massive overtime bill in Sherriff Street sorting office.  The sum involved is approximately £15 million and if that could be cut out there would be no need to be talking about roadside letter boxes.  They have a role to play and I hope they will have a positive attitude during their talks with management.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate that Fianna Fáil Deputies were the first to move on this issue and that the Minister took immediate action.  Despite the efforts made to put the message across that this was a Fianna Fáil inspired plan, let me say it was never our plan, it still is not our plan, and as a Fianna Fáil backbenchers I hope it will never be part of a Government plan.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we recognise in that context the vital importance of the local post office as both a source of State services and also a valuable meeting place in rural communities.  In fact one of the primary objectives of the Progressive Democrats is to devolve greater power and responsibility to local communities so that local initiatives, enterprise and <Col N="1778" /> decision making can be properly tapped. It is in that context obviously that it is vital to ensure the survival of viable communities in every part of the country.</P>
      <P>That is the essential background to the stand of the Progressive Democrats in relation to the viability plan drawn up by An Post's management.  I fully sympathise with the financial dilemma faced by An Post, and in particular every party in this House must take note of the fact that the company would be insolvent in three years time if their present and projected rate of losses were to continue.  It is vital therefore that An Post are restored to viability, and that must be done too without further demands being made on the hard-pressed taxpayer. There are always ways and means of achieving this objective and one of the regrettable features of An Post's plan was the manner of their initial announcement which smacked of being an imposition rather than the fruits of consultation.</P>
      <P>As a Government party the Progressive Democrats are, of course, party to the National Economic and Social Council's review of the overall viability plan, and in particular its implications for the future of rural post offices and also the feasibility or otherwise of introducing roadside letter boxes in some areas.  The bottom line now is that the entire viability plan is under review&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the proper way to proceed.  We need an agreed and not an imposed plan to restore An Post to economic viability.  I want to emphasise again that it should not be imposed on workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad also that the NESC study of the An Post viability plan will also incorporate examination of possible <Col N="1779" /> alternative commercial activities for post offices which could help to restore many of them to economic viability and thereby improve the overall financial wellbeing of An Post.  Clearly An Post face a difficult future as they grapple with measures to regain viability, but at the same time they must ensure that their plan does not cause damage to the fabric of Irish society and rural life in particular.  The Progressive Democrats believe that every possible option must be examined in the overall review of the viability plan in talks between the management and unions.  I believe there is a total commitment by both management and unions to bring about a successful end to the whole plan. These two objectives must be uppermost at all times.  I hope the management and the unions talk well.  I believe job reductions will be achieved on a voluntary basis as part of a positive development and this must augur well for the eventual resolution of this very serious and complex economic and social problem. I am convinced from my talks with both unions and management that there is a commitment which must be encouraged, especially by Members of this House, in order to bring about a successful conclusion to the negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this very important issue.  When this plan was first published it was recognised by this party as being unacceptable.  We were aware that it would cause great hardship and agony throughout the country and that the shedding of 1,500 jobs willy nilly was not acceptable.  The closure of 500 sub-post offices and the erection of up to 200,000 post boxes was equally unacceptable.  We also recognised that the regarding of many of the post offices mentioned was unsuitable in many places such as the town of Youghal which has a population of over 6,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his wisdom also recognised these shortcomings.  Having had discussions within the party and negotiations with the unions, he decided to initiate a study by the NESC.  This <Col N="1780" /> decision has been rubbished by the Opposition as not being practical.  I reject this. It is practical and it is being carried out in order to crystallise the impact of the proposed closure of sub-post offices and the erection of post boxes.  It is important that the impact of these measures should be set out clearly for everybody to see and understand so that we will not be making decisions based on half truths and emotional statements.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to consider new sources of business and finance for An Post.  Over the years expenditure has increased while revenue has not increased to the same extent.  An Post need to generate more revenue to become viable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been instrumental in getting management and unions together in negotiation.  This is the crucial element in sorting out the problem.  It is only through negotiation that a sensible resolution of the problem can be found for the betterment of An Post.</P>
    <P>It is particularly cynical that Fine Gael have brought forward this motion while the negotiations are in progress.  It is purely an election gimmick and will be seen as such.  At the end of the day the course of action decided upon by management and unions will ensure that An Post will be an efficient and effective organisation giving value for money and providing a social service.  The leader of Fine Gael was a great supporter and preacher of efficiency, effectiveness and value for money but he seems to have changed tack during the past couple of weeks.  I presume his new adviser has had some effect.</P>
    <P>The 1984 Act provided for up to £70 million for An Post.  I understand only £5 million was provided in 1984 and £4 million in 1986.  An Post should have been established on a proper footing in those years.  My party were not in Government at the time.  Perhaps Members opposite will be able to explain why they did not provide the necessary funding when they set up An Post as a semi-State body.</P>

The answer rests with management and unions and will emerge in negotiations between them.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I also welcome Deputy Currie's new-found interest in An Post's services and viability plan.  Little thought went into putting this plan together.  It smacks of arrogance by management and a &ldquo;get rid of workmen at all costs&rdquo; attitude with no concern for the workers, their families, mortgages or whatever other payments they may have to make.  I say from this side of the House that this country cannot afford to lose another 1,500 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had first hand experience of all this since the document was issued.  The week after the document was issued the sub-post office in Enniscorthy was closed. We decided to take action.  The full urban council with myself as chairman, and with Deputy Ivan Yates decided we would pay Mr. Hynes a visit in the GPO in Dublin. We marched in and pointed out to him the foolishness of the decision to close that sub-post office and we outlined all the reasons it should not be closed.  We pointed out that it provided a service for over 3,000 customers and how ridiculous it was to take a decision to close a post office that served so many.  We invited Mr. Hynes to come to Enniscorthy and see the situation for himself.  Eventually <Col N="1783" /> he decided to come and as a result the following week that sub-post office was reopened.</P>
    <P>I would like to say here tonight to the Minister and to Mr. Hynes and put on public record, that we do not intend to allow the sub-post office to close again. There is need for it despite the facts and figures management tried to put to us on that occasion.  Some of the decisions and thoughts in this document are absolute lunacy.  I have here also the document, <i>Save the Postal Service</i> from the unions involved and 14 or 15 snippets from newspapers, and the only people mentioned in the fight to save post offices are Fianna Fáil backbench TDs.  Nowhere in that document, on the back page or in all the snippets, are the Labour Party, The Workers' Party or the Fine Gael Party mentioned.  Headings are: &ldquo;TDs Fight Post Office Closures&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rural Fianna Fáil TDs Express Concern at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party&rdquo;.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I compliment the Minister, Deputy Brennan, on his work today.  He has opened doors so management and workers will be able to have discussions, and the workers will have tough discussions with management. We found management quite difficult to deal with and fairly closed minded on what they intend.  The whole problem started with their decision to dump 1,500 people on the dole queues and close 550 post offices without consultations or negotiations.  As we approach the 21st century that should not be management's attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Managements are particularly to blame because they have not diversified into a number of areas over the years.  Extra business can be gained dealing with <Col N="1784" /> motor tax, driving licences, parking fines, driving test fees, ESB payments and many other areas, but it seems management had no interest in this.  They felt the Governments of the day would subsidise them forever.  We are all taxpayers and the workers in An Post are taxpayers, and taxpayers' money cannot continue forever to subsidise companies if they are making a loss.</P>
    <P>I hope negotiation will continue.  I have a letter here from Mr. David Beggs, whom I regard as a very reasonable man, thanking me and my colleagues in Enniscorthy Urban Council for arranging meetings on behalf of Enniscorthy postal workers with the Taoiseach when he was in Enniscorthy six weeks ago.  That is the way forward, through discussions, negotiations and talks.</P>
    <P>A number of people in the postal service, particularly postmen approaching retirement age, would accept voluntary redundancy or voluntary retirement. That should be considered.  I welcome what the Minister said last night; that An Post management had informed him that any jobs to go would be on a voluntary basis.  That is a very important concession. Whatever chance An Post management had of getting agreement, they now have none because of the arrogant attitude they adopted over the past two months.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Brennan, inherited this problem on his first or second day in office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1785" /> Last night the Minister stated that An Post decided to have negotiations regarding the downgrading of post offices. Again let me point out the ridiculous situation under which management are trying to operate.  They have operated the post office in Enniscorthy, spent massive amounts on computerisation, and wages and salaries for Dún Laoghaire, Enniscorthy, Gorey and Wexford are paid from there.  The records of TV licences for the entire County Wexford are on computer.</P>
    <P>The ESB chose Enniscorthy for their south-east headquarters and the DVO chose it for their regional office.  The management in the green document propose Wexford town for a main post office and that Enniscorthy be downgraded.  Is this not false economy, a waste of taxpayers' money and public funds and another example of crazy decisions by An Post management?  The Minister should have a serious talk with them and tell them he is not prepared to take the type of decisions they are considering or tolerate this waste of money.  He must ensure that at the end of the day through conciliation talks and negotiations an agreeable solution is found.  It is important also at the end of the day that An Post workers be happy with any decisions arrived at.</P>
    <P>As I said, I welcome the support Fianna Fáil backbenchers are now getting from the far side of the House.  It is two months late but support at any time is very welcome I have complete faith in the Minister's ability to resolve this problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The postal service is a facility we have all tended to take for granted.  We all assume that, irrespective of the weather, the postman and postwoman will be there every morning five days a week, all year round, in good weather and bad, to deliver the mail, but the postal service has meant far more to people especially in rural Ireland, than simply a facility for collecting and delivering letters.  For many&mdash;particularly those living alone or in isolated areas &mdash; it has been the only link with the outside world. It has been an important part of the social infrastructure of this country &mdash; especially as we have, by comparison with most other European countries, fewer telephones per head of the population.</P>
      <P>It is now clear that our postal service as we have known it is under great threat. If Oscar Wilde's definition of a cynic is accurate &mdash; one who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing &mdash; then those who drew up this viability plan and the Government which are giving it such support, irrespective of what is being said from the back benches here today, are guilty of very great cynicism indeed. It is very easy for the Government or An Post management to say that postal deliveries to the door cost so much, and must therefore be dropped from 200,000 homes.  Who assesses the value of such services to the community?  Who counts the costs of withdrawing them?  It is all very well to say that shedding 1,500 jobs will save so much, but who counts the social costs to the workers and their families of losing their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" /> Postal communications cannot be viewed as a simple commercial enterprise &mdash; it is not like selling beans.  The social dimension must be a crucial factor in any decisions about the future of the service taken either by the Government or the management of An Post.  Any other approach may save some money for the Government, but it will inflict enormous damages on the social infrastructure of this country.</P>
    <P>At a time when unemployment is at such an appalling level, at almost 260,000 and believed by many to be heading for 300,000 it is particularly shocking that the Government should be seeking to shed another 1,500 jobs in the public sector. The Minister said last night that there will be no compulsory redundancies, but whether they are achieved voluntarily or by compulsion, the fact remains that if the Government have their way, 1,500 more people will be without jobs and the vast majority of them will have little prospect of getting any new employment: 1,500 more people on the dole queues which are already costing this country more than £2 billions per year in terms of social welfare payments and tax and PRSI foregone.  It is my calculation, on the best advice available to me, that the maximum number of voluntary departures from An Post will be in the region of 500.  The plan stands or falls on shedding 1,500 jobs.  Its centre plank is cutting back on costs by reducing its single biggest cost item, wages.  If the Minister assures us that there will be only voluntary redundancies, then he should take the next step and concede that the plan, as presently constituted, has no validity whatsoever. The negotiations he talks about should not be between management and the union at conciliation and arbitration or anywhere, on a plan that has no validity or basis at this stage but it should be on a tripartite basis involving management, union and Government dealing with the comprehensive rebuilding of An Post with capital backing and a greater expanded role for An Post.  If the Minister makes the play as he did here last night, that there will be no compulsion in <Col N="1788" /> job shedding, and on the basis that 1,500 jobs cannot be shed on a voluntary basis &mdash; there can be no doubt about that &mdash; then the Minister should admit that the plan has not validity, take the next step and accept the motion that has been tabled here in the name of Deputy Currie and supported by the other parties in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the Minister's two-handed reel play with regard to this issue. On the one hand he has fed the line to his backbenchers here in the Chamber to attack this plan and management in the way they have gone about it.  On the other hand he says there will be no compulsion. Mr. Hynes and the board of An Post when they met with The Workers' Party left us in no doubt as they left the unions and everyone else concerned in no doubt, that he is ridding the company of 1,500 jobs whether they like it or not, whether the unions will take it or not or whether the Government want it.  That is the job they are about.  If the Minister does not agree with that, then let us tear up this plan tonight, accept what is being proposed by Fine Gael and supported by all other Members in the House and it would appear, also supported by every back bencher who has spoken on the Minister's behalf and apparently in his cause.  He cannot play it both ways and the Minister is attempting to do so but it will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The shedding of 1,500 jobs is taking place within six months of the signing with great fanfare of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which was supposed to have had a key objective not just a substantial increase in employment, but also higher standards of living and improved social services for all.  The programme also spoke of the Government's commitment to the maintenance of a viable and profitable commercial semi-State sector.  The Irish Sugar Company workers, who made such a sacrifice to put that company into profitability over the past five years, have found out just what that means, as the Government rushed to privatise the company earlier this year.  The legislation to privatise Irish Life is already in place and the B &amp; I are <Col N="1789" /> also now in the sights of this Minister. Indeed, with the exception of his Progressive Democrat colleagues, there is probably no other Cabinet member who has so repeatedly displayed his undisguised hostility to the public sector.  It may well be part of the Minister's long term strategy to secure the run down of An Post to such an extent that it will lead to a demand for privatisation in time.  If this is his objective, he should say so.  If not, he should start putting some effort into helping An Post to overcome their current difficulties and to establish themselves on a sound basis.</P>
    <P>When the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill was going through the Dáil in 1982, many expressed the hope that freeing both An Post and Telecom Éireann from the dead hand of Civil Service control would allow both concerns to be well run and profitable semi-State companies within a brief period.  While Telecom has been largely a success &mdash; although with a considerable cost in terms of job reductions also &mdash; An Post has continued to face serious problems, and everyone, particularly the workers and their unions, recognise the need to change and adapt.</P>
    <P>An Post have had to face particular problems over the past decade.  The growth in electronic mail &mdash; FAX and other systems &mdash; has clearly hit their business as has the growth in courier services, many of whom are shamelessly exploiting young people and paying little better than slave wages.  When real plans are put in place with real commitment from An Post they have delivered with their workers.  The parcel service system now operating at the Naas Road is exemplary in coming into profitability within a short period of being established.  The courier service would make far more profit for An Post if it was allowed to expand.  Why will it not expand?  They will not expand because An Post and their management with the backing of the Minister are in the business of shedding jobs and of not recruiting.  They would expand and they would meet and take on the cowboy courier service if they could recruit extra <Col N="1790" /> workers but they are not allowed to do this at present.</P>
    <P>However, the major cause of the problems has been the failure of the Government to ensure that An Post has the capital necessary to expand, develop and modernise.  The single problem facing An Post since 1983 and the single problem today is the failure of this Minister and successive Ministers to enable An Post capitalise sufficiently to modernise and develop.  The result of this has been a run down in the fleet of vehicles, deteriorating buildings and an inability to introduce new and modern business systems. Section 29 of the Postal and Telecommunications Act allowed the Minister to make available a sum not exceeding £50 million for capital works. My understanding is that very little of this has been provided to date.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister wondered at our call in our amendment for the Government to make a capital commitment. The Workers' Party oppose &mdash; and we want to make this point very clear &mdash; the concept of shedding jobs for the sake of balancing books.  If jobs are to be shed, then workers demand and should expect a <i>quid pro quo</i>, not a repeat of the slaughter of jobs for nothing as was visited on An Post in 1988.  Let us remember that 1,100 jobs were forfeited by the workers to managements on the basis that things would be improved, and nothing improved for a day.</P>
    <P>The re-establishment of An Post and its development must come not just from costly borrowing from banks as the Minister demands but mainly in the short and medium-term from Government using taxpayers resources.  Too many State and semi-State organisations have creaked and groaned from year to year under excruciating bank interest rates.  No worker should ever be prepared to forfeit a job on the simply promise of viability; book balancing always spells one message for the worker, redundancy and the dole queue.  This plan offers nothing for the future expansion of An Post without ministerial and Government backing.  In short The Workers' Party &mdash; and I am glad to see the workers and the unions <Col N="1791" /> accept this &mdash; reject the Minister's bottom line position that there should be no State subsidy.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was going through the Dáil the question of the capital to be made available to An Post received quite an amount of attention.  Speaking on our party's behalf Deputy De Rossa said in column No. 1852 of the Official Report of 16 June 1983:</P>
    <P>There is a great need for capital investment and because £50 million will not be sufficient An Bord Poist will have to go to the banks and borrow at inflated interest rates.  That will cause problems.  It should be remembered that there are many State companies in serious trouble because of the amount of interest they have to pay to private banking institutions.  I appeal to the Minister to consider raising the £50 million to £100 million. </P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden, now a Minister of State in the Government, took up that point later in the debate and argued that it was necessary for the Minister to allocate at least £75 million for investment in buildings and other capital works.  What has happened to that commitment and demanded by a Deputy who is now a member of the present Government?</P>
    <P>Because we consider that adequate capital for An Post is crucial to their future success, we tabled our amendment which, I understand, has now been accepted by Fine Gael.  As long as capital is provided, I am sure that both management and workers can co-operate in improving services to the public without virtually destroying the postal service which the viability plan, in its present form, would certainly do.  No one can deny that there is room for improvement. Some surveys have suggested that the postal service here is among the most expensive and the slowest in Europe. This is not in anyone's interest.</P>
    <P>If they are to thrive, An Post must also expand beyond their core postal activities. Why have successive Governments refused to allow An Post to expand into the banking area?  This is another acid <Col N="1792" /> test for the Minister and the Government. They say they are in favour of the expansion and viability of An Post but if this is true, then they should answer a simple question here tonight or whenever the opportunity presents itself: when will they allow An Post to enter the banking arena and engage in serious competition with banking interests?  Why is it possible for people to walk into any bank in the country and pay an ESB bill but impossible to do so in any post office?  Why is it that the only things a person can buy in most post offices are stamps, lotto tickets and licences?  Why has no attempt been made to encourage post offices to sell postcards, birthday cards and other stationery products?  These would be natural complementary activities.  Why is it possible for people in the UK to get driving licences, road tax discs, passports and other official documents through their post offices, when none of these is available in post offices in Ireland?</P>
    <P>Since this controversy blew up at the beginning of the year, I have been in contact with many postal workers, both personally and in correspondence.  I have been impressed with their commitment not just to preserving their jobs but to preserving the quality of our postal services. I want to congratulate them on the way they have organised themselves to resist this plan.  There was no question of simply lying down and accepting the plan. They fought back and come up with imaginative and progressive ideas of their own for the expansion and development of the postal services.  All those who want to see our postal services preserved and developed owe these workers and the Communications Union of Ireland a debt of gratitude today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking in this debate tonight, I want to take my cue from the community in the small village of Bartlemy.  A Deputy who spoke a short while ago in this House visited that community and committed himself wholeheartedly to supporting the people in that rural area of County Cork.  Rural areas have already suffered as a result of the <Col N="1793" /> closure of small schools and Garda stations and doctors panels being sucked into larger units.  An attack is now being made on post offices.  This will tear the heart out of rural communities.  Small post offices are of great importance to the less well off, the unemployed, and the elderly.  It has been proposed by the EC that Structural Funds should be used to develop rural areas through a rural development programme.  However, we now find that our Government are undermining EC policy on the issue of rural development.</P>
      <P>If the Government do not support the motion before the House tonight, the viability plan put forward by An Post will be put into operation.  The abolition of second deliveries will lead to a loss of jobs; I have investigated this issue in my town of Mallow.  Second deliveries will not be made in towns and there is no guarantee that letters will be delivered the day after they were posted to areas outside towns.  This is what is proposed in the plan.  Larger companies will be less likely to set up in areas where there is a poor postal service.  In addition, small and medium sized enterprises will be less likely to flourish in these areas.</P>
      <P>I have read a statement made recently by the chief executive officer of An Post. This gives us a fair idea of the thinking of the bureaucrats who put forward this plan which will decimate rural Ireland.  He said that if a person builds a house 25 metres from a road the postman should not have to travel this extra distance when postmen in Dublin can drop letters in the door.  This gives us an indication of the thinking behind this viability plan. These bureaucrats are basically saying rural Ireland should be forgotten and they will concentrate on Dublin.  Consequently, the plan they have  proposed must be rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been stated that while there are delivery problems elsewhere, letters could be delivered in Dublin for as little as 16p.  These problems are being experienced by people in rural areas who have made sacrifices down the years and it is now proposed that postal services should be taken from them.  These services will <Col N="1794" /> not be taken away if all parties vote in favour of this motion and if the Government are serious about maintaining a viable rural community.  I concur with the points made by my colleague Deputy McCartan on the need for support for this motion.  If Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats do not vote in favour of this motion tonight, they cannot go out to the people and say they support them on this issue.  If they vote against this motion they will once again be demonstrating the ambivalence and ambiguity they have shown down the years.</P>

      <P>As my time is limited, I will confine my remarks to two important areas.  I want to deal first with the question of whether we need to recruit people with a record of using boot boy managerial tactics to sort out companies.  It is most reprehensible that Governments, including this Coalition Government, should place our commercial semi-State companies in the hands of roving guns for hire like chief executives, especially when one looks at the damages they have caused the companies to which they were appointed.</P>

      <P>Have Dublin Bus been able to provide a cheaper or more efficient bus service, have the huge number of passengers who had abandoned the service now returned to it or have they been able to make more profits since the former chief executive of An Post was appointed as managing director of that company?  The answer is no.  One cannot help thinking about the huge number of men and women who were sacrificed and allowed to end upon the dole queues and wondering if An Post are destined to go down the same road.  Why was one of the first acts of the new chief executive of An Post and act of incitement by choosing to withdraw from the tried and tested conciliation and arbitration scheme? What sort of managerial skills provoke industrial confrontation and unrest?  I say to the chief executive that this is the wrong road to take in trying to solve some of the many problems of An Post.</P>
      <P>Everybody is aware of the financial problems of An Post.  One only has to look at the chairman's statement in the 1990 annual report to learn of these problems.  The communications workers know the financial difficulties of An Post as do the trade union officials.  No management can afford to ignore the contributions trade unions can make in working with management to solve such problems.  The old management tactic is being used by An Post, that of provocation, throwing in the thrash can the conciliation and arbitration scheme that came into existence through the struggle of trade unions and management down the years.  That can have no role in modern Irish industrial practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on sub-post offices, particularly in Dublin.  Many of these offices share premises with local hardware shops stinking of paraffin oil while others operate from the parlours <Col N="1796" /> of Georgian houses, complete with bay windows, garage-like premises and buildings which look as if they should be on the dangerous buildings list.  There should be an improvement in the type and standard of sub-post offices.  I am tired of seeing elderly people queueing on the pavements in inclement weather waiting to be served in these sub-post offices.  Very often there is not even a chair, a writing desk or any facility for customers to do their business in any degree of comfort or privacy.  If we are serious in our demands that An Post provide a wider range of service, including banking services, consideration must be given to our sub-posts offices.</P>
    <P>Why are An Post not building their own post offices like the excellent ones in Rathmines, Andrew Street or South Anne Street where customers can do their business in comfort?  Why, for example, is the Crumlin sub-post office about 50 yards from the Crumlin sorting office?  Why do An Post have no integrated post office system?  Why, for example, has the Tallaght Town Centre no district integrated post office, while Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock and Ballsbridge have?  Among the many questions to be addressed by the management of An Post, including coming up with a viability programme, is the structure and nature of the sub-post office system with a view to upgrading it to an acceptable, modern 20th century standard. That must be done if we are serious about competing with the banks, credit unions and building societies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We were all awakened this morning to be assured that the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications had told the House, the nation and the postal workers two things: first, that this Government would allow no unwarranted dismantling of the postal <Col N="1797" /> service and, second, that any redundancies would be on a voluntary basis. Those two statements were deliberately calculated in view of the present electoral climate and the damage that Government support for this disastrous policy by An Post is having on Fianna Fáil candidates throughout the country.</P>
      <P>This Minister, Deputy Brennan, is the third Progressive Democrat Minister at the Cabinet table.  He is a firm believer in privatisation, as anybody who looks at his record will know, whether with regard to B &amp; I, his attempts to support Ryanair or indeed, the range of State companies now in his portfolio.  His solution is privatisation but, of course, you cannot tell that to the Fianna Fáil voter at grassroot level because that would mean another 1,500 jobs in An Post going the way of so many jobs in the Irish Sugar Company, B &amp; I and so on.</P>
      <P>The Minister deserves no credit for the statement on voluntary redundancies. The fact that he assures the House that An Post have told him they will try to effect any jobs losses on a voluntary basis is due entirely to the trade union involved.  There are two types of trade union leaders, those who are all wind and bombast and whose reward is to be photographed with the Taoiseach or Ministers of the day and, if they are lucky, end up getting an appointment to the Seanad; the other is the kind of trade union leadership who mean what they say, who analyse the problems and having done so stand firm by their commitment. The leadership of the Communications Workers' Union made it very clear to their members in public demonstrations around the country that they would not accept job losses except on a voluntary basis, if at all.  That is why An Post can now assure the Minister that redundancies will be only on a voluntary basis, not because of any intervention on the part of the Minister or the Government. As soon as 28 June rolls around the essence of this programme will be supported by the present Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, and that is a fact of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to ask why were An Post <Col N="1798" /> allowed to get into the sorry state they are in now.  Why, for example, when both An Post and An Bord Telecom were taken from under the umbrella of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at the time do we have on the one hand a very successful, modern, highly technical company as An Bord Telecom with capacity for diversification, expansion and employment in the economy and on the other hand the run down decrepit company the management of An Post allowed that company to get into?</P>
    <P>The former management of An Post have a great deal to answer for, and indeed, the former chairman of An Post has presumably learned the lesson that running a commercial enterprises like this is not as simple as selling apples and oranges.  Consequently, the company are in a mess, greatly exacerbated by the Government.  They have deliberately run down An Post over the years, trying to balance their commitment to feather bedding, as they did deliberately in the time of the other Progressive Democrat member, former Minister Martin O'Donoghue, with their objectives that we want lean commercial companies that are viable in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>An Post are totally under-capitalised. For example, their capacity to raise money from small savers in terms of making a contribution to the domestic sourcing of our national debt has been completely ignored.  It appears they have gone out of their way to contrive not to raise as much money from small savers as they might.  That was a cheap sources of funding to support the national debt but it is another aspect that has been allowed to run down completely.  It is hypocritical to compare this to the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to a viable, thriving commercial State sector.  How can you have a viable, thriving State sector when, one after the other, these companies are being knocked off?  It is not as if we had alternatives in the private sector because jobs are not being created in the private sector.  This House has at last agreed that there is an unemployment crisis, but the <Col N="1799" /> answer of the Government, far from improving the prospects of the commercial State sector, is to make another 1,500 people redundant, if they can.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I gave give very little credence to the Minister's response last night.  If this battle is to be won it will be won by the workers in An Post and by the people and local communities who are threatened in this case.  With 250,000 people unemployed, we cannot afford to wantonly allow another 1,500 people and the postal service to be undermined.  It is a matter for management to manage the postal service back to health, to diversify and open up new activities where necessary, accept the facts of modern life &mdash; that electronic mail is on the way and so on, but this is not the way to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has appointed NESC-recommended consultants to carefully evaluate the current situation in An Post.  It is said that in Ireland everybody knows everybody else. The postman is like the central cog, in that they play an important role in the life of every village, town and city.  Postmen travel the highways and byways of the country not only delivering mail but also sharing a friendly, familiar face and kind word.  That, in itself, is a social service. That is one of the reasons that myself and my fellow backbenchers in the Fianna Fáil Party oppose the viability plan proposed by the management of An Post and certainly not backed or stood behind by the present Minister.</P>
      <P>I have always advocated that sub-post offices should be extended and used by the community for paying household bills such as gas, electricity, fuel, and so on.  In fact, in the past few years I have regularly suggested on Dublin City Council that rent payments should be paid in local sub-post offices.  That would facilitate all residents, particularly senior citizens and parents who already collect their pensions, children's allowances and so on from post offices.  Those are only a few suggestions for the use of sub-post offices, but there are many more &mdash; the list is endless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> The current debate about An Post may have a good effect.  The workers in An Post do not want to inflict any hardship or inconvenience on the public.  They are looking for a fully negotiated and consultative agreement.  Negotiations are under way at the moment.  A non-confrontational approach is needed.  It is to be hoped that a solution that is acceptable to all concerned will be found. The winners, of course, will be all three groups &mdash; the workers, An Post and the general public.  By the end of 1992&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>By the end of 1992 An Post will have incurred a loss of £31 million. We all realise that corrective action is essential.  The viability plan is only one proposal.  It is a series of various different proposals put forward for discussion and consideration.  The aim is that An Post will at one stage not need a subsidy, in other words, that it will break even, as they did, and quite well, in 1987 and 1988.</P>
      <P>I am now urging the unions to prepare I am now urging the unions to prepare and present an alternative to this plan so that all sides can have their say and everyone will know and discuss the pluses and minuses of the various proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion has been moved by the Fine Gael Party at this particular time, a few weeks before the local elections, for cheap political gain.  There is no doubt in my mind that the motion is completely political.  If there were anything in the proposal that might solve the particular <Col N="1801" /> problem then one could say that Fine Gael were doing a good thing for the country, but there is not.  Fine Gael are using the motion for purely political reasons.  The motion contains not one constructive proposal.  I have no doubt that in the next few weeks when I am out canvassing the people out there will know exactly what is going on.  My view and I certainly hope it is the Government's, is that any reduction in employment should be made on a voluntary basis.  We do not want anything to destroy or take An Post apart.  The Government motion will be voted on in the House tonight.  I shall be glad to vote along with the Minister, knowing full well that he will do what is necessary to help bring An Post around and look after the employment of the large number of people in the organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Kenny and our spokesperson, Deputy Currie.</P>
      <P>I register my complete disapproval of the plan of An Post, supported by the Minister and the Government, to close down 500 rural post offices.  It will have a devastating effect on the constituency I represent, a border constituency.  That will be the last straw for towns such as Belturbet, Blacklion and Swanlinbar that have been earmarked for post office closure.  Those communities have fought gallantly to survive, despite the cross-Border trading that has been encouraged there by the Government in various tax proposals.  Each backbench troubadour from the Government side, has sung the same song about value for money.  Can the Minister show the House better value for money than the average £50 a week, £2,500 per annum, paid to post masters of rural post offices?  Is there better value for money in any organisation or business than the service provided by those people?  No, there is not.  The reason for the plan is cutback.  The soft option is rural Ireland where the votes are scarce and there are not the people to oppose the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on all fairminded people, whether they be rural or urban, not to allow the <Col N="1802" /> Government to pursue this unfair plan, which cannot be allowed in any democracy. Rural Ireland is entitled to a service in the same way as Dublin 4 or other urban areas.  I ask the Minister to rethink the plan and give the people of rural Ireland a chance to survive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is both a recipe for social tragedy and an opportunity and challenge to revolutionise a service that has been on a downward spiral for a considerable time.  The Minister, Deputy Brennan's roots are set deep in the province of Connacht and I have no doubt that as an astute political figure, he has no intention of presiding over the decimation of rural Ireland or indeed, the crucifixion of a social service that has long been in operation.</P>
      <P>Certainly work practice has to change and Government support must be available for that.  An Post can be moved into the 21st century by providing a fast, safe, efficient and confidential service &mdash; otherwise people would not use it &mdash; but that cannot be done by closing down post offices, by regarding other post offices, by making redundancies and by using rural post boxes to the extent mentioned.</P>
      <P>The proposed closures will not save money.  They will further add to the loss of morale within the service and will continue the decline of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister, are we in rural Ireland to have the friendly post person's step become as scarce and as unique as the corncrake?  Are we being sent back to the days of carrier pigeons?  I call on Fianna Fáil Deputies, whom I have heard at public meetings, county council meetings and every other kind of meeting swear their fidelity to the House and to a rejection of this plan, to walk through lobbies this evening in accordance with their words of courage on public platforms. Let the Minister, Deputy Brennan, stand up at the Cabinet table and thump the table if he has to stop the plan going through.  Instead, let him move on to strand two, move into the 21st century, and give An Post Government backing <Col N="1803" /> to provide a fast, safe, efficient and confidential service.  Then he can make his bid for leadership in time to come.</P>

      <P>This has been an interesting and useful debate.  I wish to thank my Fine Gael colleagues, Deputies Flanagan, Bradford, Hogan, Browne, Creed, Boylan and Kenny for their valuable contributions.  I wish also to thank those Labour and Workers' Party Deputies who spoke in support of the motion.  I am accepting The Workers' Party amendment.</P>
      <P>I would also like to thank those members of the trade union movement who have provided information to members of all parties to enable us to make up our minds on this issue and to congratulate them on the dignified and responsible way in which they have campaigned on this matter.</P>
      <P>May I add that I regret that An Post felt it necessary to place an advertisement in today's press which I believe was petty and insensitive as well as misrepresenting the position.  They clearly were not listening either to the Minister or myself when we emphasised the necessity for sensitivity and goodwill between management and unions.</P>
      <P>I thank also the Minister and the other Fianna Fáil members who spoke.  I also thank the lone Progressive Democrats Deputy, Deputy Wyse, who spoke on the motion too.  I listened with great interest to all of them.  In my opening speech I said there was an issue of credibility involved in that many Fianna Fáil Deputies had opposed proposals in the viability plan in the most trenchant terms at local meetings, at council meetings and in the local press.</P>
      <P>I said &ldquo;now is the testing time for their sincerity&rdquo; and I have been proved right. Deputy John O'Donoghue told us he was opposed to the proposals and remained so.  He accused Fine Gael of playing politics and alleged that &ldquo;not a whimper was heard from Fine Gael until it got near the local elections&rdquo;.  Deputy Dempsey made the same allegation this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy O'Donoghue's credibility is <Col N="1804" /> to be judged on the basis of his statements in this regard then I am sorry to say that little confidence can be reposed in him. The fact is that the viability plan was published on 7 February and that very same day by way of Private Notice Question I, and Deputies McCartan and O'Sullivan raised it in the Dáil and objected in the strongest terms to the ignoring of what I called &ldquo;the human face&rdquo; of An Post.  Deputy Dempsey said this evening that Fianna Fáil backbenchers were the first to protest within two or three days.  If so, it was two or three days too late.  We were in first. Some reference was made to the lateness of putting down a motion on this matter, but as early as 19 February I tabled a motion signed by all 55 members of the Fine Gael Party.  It was the first motion to appear on the Order Paper.  So much for Deputy Dempsey's veracity and credibility.  Deputy O'Donoghue went on to allege that the demonstration on television of how vulnerable the post boxes were to crime and vandalism was an incitement to crime on the part of Deputy Currie.</P>
    <P>If I incited to crime, so also did responsible members of the Communications Workers' Union who co-operated with me in a responsible and educative exercise. If they do not mind the allegation, neither do I.  I am used to it.  The last person who accused me of inciting to crime wore a dog collar and had the first name of &ldquo;Ian&rdquo;, so I do not mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hillery made a more temperate contribution in which he spelled out in realistic terms the financial crisis facing An Post.  He pointed out, as the Minister did earlier, that:</P>
    <P>An Post lost £3.6 million in 1989 and almost £10 million last year after modest profits in 1987 and 1988.  The Company's budget shows a loss of up to £7 million for this year and £14 million for 1992.  Unless remedial measures are taken An Post's accumulated losses by end 1992 will be £31 million. </P>
    <P>Deputy Hillery prompted again in my mind, the question I had asked the Dáil <Col N="1805" /> the very day the viability plan was published&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;How have things been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that the picture now being painted is of a service in financial crisis, amounting almost to a doomsday situation&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>Maybe Deputy Hillery as a representative of that section of Fianna Fáil which would pride itself on its commitment to &ldquo;sound financial management&rdquo; should ponder on the fact that An Post was in profit until his party took over.</P>
    <P>How have things been allowed to go so disastrously wrong under their stewardship? Deputy Stafford was the last speaker to contribute before me.  I wondered about him.  Others wondered about him and about what side of the motion he was on.  He reminded me of someone or something.  I could not remember who or what, until Deputy Kenny reminded me.  He reminded me of the corncrake.  I could hear him, but I was not sure in what field he was.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a more surprising speech, signifying nothing and not even full of sound and fury.  I have given some thought to this because, as the Minister knows, I have considerable respect for his abilities &mdash; a man usually worthy of testing one's steel against.  I have come to the conclusion that the &ldquo;nothingness&rdquo; in the speech was deliberate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister wants as little as possible on the record because he knows already what he intends to do, that is when the local government elections are out of the way.  He does not want any quotable quotes on the record which might come <Col N="1806" /> back to haunt him when he announces his intention of implementing unpopular decisions after the elections.</P>
    <P>However, there is one matter on which the Minister was less controversial than he intended and one matter on which he was more controversial than he intended.</P>
    <P>He told us with a great show of solemnity how glad he was to be able to tell the House:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That An Post have now informed me that it is their clear objective that job reductions will be of a voluntary nature&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>So what?  He told us that the very first day the viability plan was discussed in this House and Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out to him that An Post were unable to do otherwise because their workers are protected under the provisions of the 1983 Act.  Then, the Minister came out with the sentence which deserves to be hung around his neck for ever:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I can assure the House that there is no question of the Government agreeing to the unwarranted dismantling of the postal network&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>There it is &mdash; the &ldquo;unwarranted dismantling&rdquo; of the postal network.  He does not give us an assurance that the postal network will not be dismantled &mdash; only that there will be no unwarranted dismantling. What dismantling of the postal system will be warranted?</P>
    <P>Will it be warranted to close down hundreds of post offices, to make redundant, hundreds or thousands of workers, to stop doorstep delivery except in the most highly populated areas, or to take away entirely the human face of An Post?</P>
    <P>I demand on behalf of this House and I would be right in demanding on behalf of all of this House that the Minister give an assurance that there will not be in any circumstances any dismantling of the postal network.  I hope the Minister will stand up now and give that assurance.  At the very least the Minister should signify to me and to the House that he withdraws the word &ldquo;unwarranted&rdquo; because that is specious.  The Minister's refusal to do so <Col N="1807" /> speaks for itself.  We now know what to expect for the future.</P>
    <P>My time is almost up.  I end as I began. This is the moment of truth for those Fianna Fáil backbenchers and the Progressive Democrats who have told us, and who told their constituents about their concern and about their opposition, who went on local radio, appeared in the local press and appeared in local council meetings saying that they would not tolerate these proposals of An Post.  This is the moment of truth for them.  We will see in a few minutes time how strongly held are the expressed convictions of the <Col N="1808" /> Fianna Fáil backbenchers who so vehemently opposed these proposals.</P>
    <P>I conclude in the immortal words of the late Lyndon B. Johnston &mdash;&ldquo;It is time to pee or get off the pot.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Private Members' Business I said that the Minister had it in his power to put an end to unfair competition from the ESB.  This is the only way we can hope to save family businesses.  This semi-State company funded by the State is in competition with small family businesses around the country.  The Minister must act on this appalling situation immediately.  I ask <Col N="1813" /> him to take the initiative and have this unfair trading stopped immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with what the previous speaker said on this matter and I hope the Minister will give every consideration to meeting the recommendations of the national campaign for a fair deal in electrical retailing.  In counties Laois and Offaly alone there are 500 families employed in the electrical retail business.  This represents just a small fraction of those engaged in this business throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will see his way towards giving these people some hope. It is a business that has suffered over a number of years, not only because of the ESB's move into the area of retailing but also because of the multinational type megastores which have moved into this market.  The retailers have no objection to competing on the same pitch as the megastores, but it is fair to say that the objections which have been levelled against the ESB have a certain degree of substance.  The matter was the subject of a report by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade in May 1990 and I hope the Minister will examine in detail the points made in that report.  While the director did not reach a conclusion that there was malpractice or unfair trading, he felt there were some points worthy of consideration.  He said it was a matter of public policy rather than something on which he could make a recommendation to the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is excessive market dominance by the ESB.  The switch to this dominant position was marked by a decision made about 18 months ago when the ESB moved into the retailing of brown goods such as radios, televisions and videos, rather than concentrate on the white goods such as refrigerators and freezers for which they had become most notorious for decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difficulty in regard to cross-subsidisation. The fact that the ESB enjoy a monopoly in their enterprise represents the element of unfair competition. The easy selling, the painless <Col N="1814" /> extraction of a few pounds by way of instalments every two months in the ESB bill, represents an unfair practice.  It is also interesting that the ESB can exercise a type of credit control which is not open to any other group in society.  A person who does not pay for his video or record player can actually lose his electricity supply.  If the family electrical shop is not paid, the owner must resort to the courts or to a debt enforcement agency to collect what is due.</P>
    <P>The ESB have a cosy arrangement where it is possible for a person to be forced to pay for a video or a refrigerator because of the sanction of losing electric light.  There is scope for the Minister to investigate the injustice in the context of overall policy towards the ESB, particularly in regard to the future of their monopoly in the supply of electricity.</P>
    <P>It would be a pity if many family businesses in our towns and cities were to be wiped out overnight by a company which has a State monopoly in the supply of electricity.  The extent of competition that has been introduced is revealed by the fact that the ESB took a full page advertisement in last Sunday's newspapers. It is not possible for any family engaged in the electrical business to compete on that sort of pitch.  I wonder where the payment for that advertisement came from.  Was it paid for from the proceeds of the sale of electricity or of white or brown goods?  It is important that there should be a clear demarcation between the retailing activities of the ESB and the sale of electricity.  That will not be the case as long as the current billing system is retained by the ESB.  I would urge the Minister to look favourably on the campaign for a fair deal in electrical trading.</P>

      <P>I want to record my opposition to the view that the ESB should be curtailed in the selling of white and brown goods.  Deputy Flanagan pointed out that a consumer's electricity supply can be cut off for inability to pay the total bill because they have purchased certain electrical items.  If that is the case; it is wrong.  The correct policy should be that the ESB charge for the consumption of electricity very clearly as against the charge for the white or brown goods that might have been purchased, so in the event of running behind in payments, as long as payments for electricity consumption are made, then the ESB can pursue the consumer for the cost of goods but not interfere with his electricity supply.</P>
      <P>The consumer must be protected against excessive interest charges.  I am not sure whether that argument has been levelled against the ESB, but the consumer is entitled to avail of a service that is on offer without facing that worry. What is wrong with private enterprise that, according to Fine Gael spokespersons, they seem incapable of competing in the sale of white and brown goods to the consumer?</P>

      <P>I found it very hard to get in on the last amendment and I am finding it equally hard on the section. With your permission, Sir, I will offer a few thoughts before I get squelched altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This point comes up very properly and relevantly because it is an example of what in section 5 is regarded as a dominant position, and the question arises whether there is an abuse of the dominant position.  I formed a view some couple of years ago when this matter was brought to my attention first and I referred it to the Director of Consumer Affairs, who investigated it and he came up with a conclusion that surprised me a little, but in essence he said it was a matter for public policy whether the ESB should be involved in the retailing of goods.  I have discussed this matter again recently with the Minister for Energy who is responsible for the ESB and he shares many of my concerns in regard to it. Together we will look at what might happen.  It strikes me as very unbalanced competition, to say the least, when one retailer has two extraordinary advantages that no other retailer has.  One is that he can cut off your most needed commodity, from your family's point of view, if you fall into any arrears on the goods you are buying.  Secondly, he has access to <Col N="1818" /> unlimited amounts of money for credit where retailers, so sneered at and derided by Deputy Byrne, cannot borrow these small sums of money for the benefit of their customers because a bank will not lend now to a borrower if the sum is less than £1,000.</P>
    <P>Since nearly all these goods cost much less than £1,000 and even a combination of them would cost less than £1,000, private retailers are effectively forced out of the market as far as credit is concerned, and therefore, are able to sell only to people who can afford to pay cash in full on the spot.  It seems that is not praticularly equitable and might well be looked at again.  It can and will be looked at from the policy point of view.  It can also be looked at under this section.  If that proves necessary it is clearly a case envisaged by the section of a dominant position and one would, therefore, have to look at the question of whether there was an abuse.  I do not think it necessary to say anymore on it now except that, no matter what definitions of the State or substantial parts of the State, that exercised our minds earlier, apply, clearly they would apply here.  There is no doubt about that because the ESB operate in every part of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased at the Minister's response and expression of thoughts in this regard.  I commend him first for referring this matter to the Director of Consumer Affairs quite some time ago.  I was one of a number of Deputies who placed questions to the Minister on this and I was happy that he referred it to the director.  I am now happy to hear him say he will look at the question of public policy entailed in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne has missed the point completely.  It should be borne in mind that when a quarter of a million people are out of work and at a time of economic depression in many homes, anything that might brighten up the lives of ordinary people is very attractive.  The advertisements published by the ESB and in all their office windows are to the effect that one can have at one's disposal new electrical goods with new technology at <Col N="1819" /> no immediate cost but put on the long finger.  Using the monopoly system and the unique ESB billing system, that is obviously to the detriment of a great number of small electrical retailers.  The Minister has rightly pointed out those two fundamental aspects.  I hope he will make a decision reasonably soon in this matter of public policy because it is of concern to those unable to borrow in the same area as the ESB whose monopoly is putting their hard won businesses into decline. I consider it is an abuse of the dominant position and I trust the Minister will deal with it accordingly.</P>

      <P>Deputies, I should mention that we have dwelt on this matter for some time especially where the ESB are concerned.  We have a large number of amendments to dispose of and I suggest that Deputies be as brief as possible so that we can move on to other amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave us a scenario of the ESB being in a position to provide credit on favourable terms <i>vis-à-vis</i> traders who, because the banks will not lend less than £1,000, find themselves at a disadvantage.  I suggest the Minister might consult with his appropriate colleagues in Cabinet in an effort to ensure and if necessary bring in legislation to ensure, that the banks and other lending agencies organise their lending arrangements to meet the needs of the people and of the consumer to a reasonable extent, and not concentrate all the time on making the enormous profits they build up year upon year.  They should realise they have a responsibility out there at large as well.  Some of their practices and also some of their interest rates are a disgrace.  Many of them do not comply even with the legislation which obliges them to make clear what their real rate of interest is and they carry a major share of the responsibility here. Let us not forget about their role and put the entire blame on the ESB.  I accept that the ESB are fully entitled to trade and compete in electricity and related <Col N="1820" /> items, but fair competition is required and if credit is a key factor, then the banks, the hire purchase companies and lending agencies have a role to play.  It is time there was some major tightening up in the legislation dealing with them because, quite frankly, they put the boot in.  Are the ESB the only people who put the boot in?  If you fall foul of one of the banks, hire purchase companies or lending agencies they will put the boot in very soundly.  They should not be allowed to pick and choose where they lend.  They should have some base, but they are not allowed to say they will lend £1,000 and upwards.  The conditions under which they get their licences ought to lay down what they are permitted to do and those conditions should be pitched to the needs of the people as well as to their principal god of making ever bigger profits.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  I want to challenge the Minister's understanding of the abuse of the dominant position by the ESB in the sale of white and brown goods.  The last place anybody with cash in their pocket, would go to buy an electrical item, are the ESB shops because they are extremely expensive.  If you have cash in your pocket you would go to the private shop.  It is not a fact that they are in a dominant position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other electrical stores.  I would argue most strongly for the retention of the rights of the ESB to sell these same items to those who are unfortunate enough not to have access to sufficient funds to purchase the goods in one clean swoop and who need to pay by instalments.  Traditionally the <Col N="1821" /> ESB have served this market and they have done an excellent job.  They have assisted many a household to upgrade the quality of their electrical goods.  I would like to see this service retained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>He gets the wrong end of the stick and a kneejerk reaction propounding the view that went out with the fall of the Berlin Wall.  The Workers' Party should realise that that kind of thinking is as out of date now as an ark. Nobody in Europe, not even his friends in Eastern Europe, is proposing that the State control everything.  No country in Europe proposes that the State should have its finger in every pie.  The Deputy should not misrepresent us, especially when he does not know what he is talking about, not having listened to the debate. Nobody said the ESB should be prohibited from selling these goods.  What we said is &mdash; and let me repeat it &mdash; that they should not have more favourable circumstances for selling than ordinary retailers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Flanagan when he said that retailers whose families have been in the trade for generations should be protected.  Nobody should be protected just because their families have been in the trade for generations.  If you came into the trade yesterday, you should get the same fair trading conditions as the ESB or anybody else.  You have no right to a living unless you are competitive and efficient.  What is happening is &mdash; and Deputy Byrne chooses not to listen or does not know or chooses to ignore &mdash; that the ESB have a dominant position in this market because they are using their monopoly in electricity generation, dividing the overheads between their retail sales pitches and electricity <Col N="1822" /> generation, and then billing the customer and cutting him off from both services if they default on one.  That is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to come to that. Deputy Byrne says that nobody with cash in their pocket would go into the ESB to buy an appliance.  Of course they would not, and the ESB do not want to sell for cash.  They want to put it on the bill and get interest on the money because they have an unlimited supply of credit from the State and do not have to pay for their credit like an ordinary retailer.  That is the reason they do not want to sell for cash.  They want to sell for credit.  We are not talking about the relatively small number of people who buy one of these products for cash.  I understand that most of these goods are bought on some from of credit.  The ESB have a dominant position under law in the generation of electricity and they are using that dominant position, as far as we can judge &mdash; and I am glad to hear the Minister say that he and the Minister for Energy are looking into this matter &mdash; to subsidise the credit given in their retail sales division, an area where they need not have a dominant position because they should be in fair competition with all the other traders selling similar goods.  That is all anybody on this side of the House is seeking.  We are not asking for special treatment for traders, we are asking for fair treatment for traders.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1) The Authority shall submit proposals to the Minister on unfair practices or unfair methods of competition in respect of particular sectors or activities where the issues arising cannot or cannot adequately be encompassed by section 4 (1) and 5 (1) of this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister having considered the proposals of the Authority and the report on which they are based may, if the interests of the common good so warrant, make an order to do all or any of the following&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  to prohibit unfair practices or unfair methods of competition,</P>
      <P>(b)  make such provision in regard to unfair practices or unfair methods of competition as to promote competition.&rdquo;.   </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to insert a new section after section 5.  The purpose of this amendment is to allow the Authority to investigate unfair practices and unfair methods of competition in regard to trading, to report them to the Minister and to put the onus on the Minister to prohibit unfair practices or unfair methods of competition.  We accept, and I think the Minister by his response to the ESB debate has shown that he accepts, there are areas where there is unfair competition and unfair trading which is not in the long term interests of the consumer and can be damaging to employment. The purpose of this amendment is to allow the Authority to investigate these areas and to submit proposals to the Minister which would allow him to introduce legislation as necessary or to make such orders as are necessary under whatever <Col N="1824" /> legislation is available to him to prohibit and to stop that unfair trading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The general approach adopted in this legislation is to move away from the sector by sector or trade by trade approach of the old restrictive practices legislation.  It seems to me that this amendment &mdash; this new section if it were to be inserted &mdash; would bring us back to the 1972 Act and, indeed, to the earlier Acts.  Subsection (2) of the amendment states:</P>
      <P>The Minister having considered the proposals of the Authority and the report on which they are based may, ...make an order to do all or any of the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is exactly what his powers are at present and he can only make an order in respect of each specified trade and he may have to change it after a few years as the circumstances within that trade and the trading competitive practices change. We have now broad general rules to prevent anti-competitive practices and to prevent the abuse of dominant positions. The making of orders in particular cases would seem, therefore, not to be the appropriate approach.  I think it is better to do it on a more general basis.  A difficulty that could arise if this section were to be inserted with section 4 and 5 is that the courts could do one thing in relation to certain matters and, independently, the Minister could come along and do something different.  We would then have a very unsatisfactory clash of jurisdiction in regard to these matters which would be a pity.  This is something I would like to avoid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36a:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> In page 6, subsection (1), line 4, before &ldquo;Any person&rdquo;, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any association whether incorporated or unincorporated which has as one of its interests or objects the review or control of anti-competitive activities and whose members include persons aggrieved, or&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow grouping or associations of people who are adversely affected by anti-competitive practices to join together in an association with the aim of bringing court proceedings to protect themselves.  As the section stands it seems that only an individual person or company who is aggrieved or affected by an anti-competitive practice will be able to bring court proceedings.  No provision is made for a group of consumers to get together to form an association and thereby give themselves some hope of being able to mount the legal action in the High Court which the Minister requires them to take, being the only avenue he leaves open to them, for the purpose of securing protection for themselves.</P>
    <P>If, for example, there was an abuse of petrol pricing and the price of a gallon of petrol was increased by an unwarranted amount, price control having been lifted rather recklessly, because of that anti-competitive practice and for the sake of 5p on a gallon of petrol, no person on his own is going to put £10,000 or £20,000 up front for the legal costs of a High Court action under section 6.  The abuse will continue because under the Bill there is no likelihood of somebody else going to court in place of that citizen.  The only other person, apart from a citizen, who would have that power would be the Minister.  As I said earlier, it is very unlikely in the extreme that the Minister will have resources in his Department to investigate the matter.  I suspect that he would be rarely, if ever, willing to initiate proceedings under section 6.</P>
    <P>It should be open to petrol consumers to band together and form a petrol users' association or some organisation of that kind.  By each member making a modest <Col N="1826" /> contribution to that association they could gear themselves up to protect the rights of the consumer.  There are already some consumer associations in existence which, with the benefit of my amendment if the House agrees to it, would be in a position to undertake proceedings, and would have the right to do so.  My amendment provides that any association, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which has as one of its interests or objects the review or control of anti-competitive activities and whose members include persons aggrieved, shall be entitled to band together and go into court to secure relief for the consumer.  Individual consumers and small companies on their own will not be in a position to initiate the High Court action required.  However, if they can band together in a group or association it will be possible for them to do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor has just explained the purpose of his amendment. If I were to accept his amendment this subsection would be extremely long and unwieldy and taken as a whole would be badly expressed.  The intention of the existing wording of the section is to try to ensure that groups of people who have a grievance have the same rights as individuals. The term used in the section is &ldquo;any person&rdquo;.  This term is frequently used in legislation to cover the plural and should not be taken literally.</P>
      <P>It would be unsatisfactory if a consumer group, for example, the Consumers' Association or an economic representative group such as the IFA who represent farmers or the ICMSA, were to be deprived of the right to initiate court proceedings and the sole onus for litigation was put on individuals.  That would not be my intention.  Even though I am advised that the present wording would cover such groups, I should like to make it a little more clear to put it beyond doubt.  I propose to discuss this matter with the parliamentary draftsman between now and Report Stage to see if it can be made clearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like the wording suggested by Deputy Taylor which is very unwieldy <Col N="1827" /> and difficult.  I agree with what the Deputy is trying to achieve but I believe it could be put more neatly than he suggests. What is important is that we make it clear that an aggrieved person, as set out in this section, includes a group of people acting together.  This is a reasonable objective and I shall try to clarify the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his constructive reply.  I appreciate his response.  Obviously I am more concerned with the object of what I am trying to achieve than with the question of whether my wording or any revised wording is adopted.  I should point out to the Minister that it is not just a question of the use of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  If that was all that was involved, that would not necessarily be a problem.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the expression &ldquo;any person who is aggrieved&rdquo;.  For example, the consumers' association could be held not to be aggrieved.  The word &ldquo;aggrieved&rdquo; could well be imported to mean that they sustained damage or loss or had a grievance which affected them while a group of associations, as an association would not, whereas it should be sufficient if some or many of their members within that association suffered a loss as a result of that anti-competitive practice.  Subject to that, I am delighted with the Minister's response and appreciate it.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 10, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  An action under this section may be brought in the High Court, the Circuit Court or the District Court provided that in the case of proceedings brought in the Circuit Court or the District Court the same jurisdiction <Col N="1828" /> limits shall apply as are applicable in those courts from time to time in actions for breach of contract and provided further that relief by way of injunction or declaration provided for in subsection (3) shall not be granted in the District Court.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This is a very important amendment.  The Minister has provided in the Bill that the right of action that is conferred must be brought in the High Court.  I find that strange and I do not understand it.</P>
    <P>There is in this country a hierarchy of courts.  There is the District Court which has jurisdiction up to £2,500, shortly to be doubled to £5,000, staffed by a very competent team of district justices who are well experienced, but of limited jurisdiction. There is the Circuit Court, a court of a higher standard which has jurisdiction at present up to £15,000, shortly, under the Bill just published, to be doubled to £30,000.  In the next few weeks it will be possible to recover £30,000 worth of damages in the Circuit Court.  It would only be necessary to go to the High Court if one was thinking in terms of recovering damages in excess of £30,000.  The key element in the remedies available to a person affected by an anti-competitive practice would be an injunction or declaratory relief.  The Circuit Court has jurisdication to grant injunctions and declaratory relief.  Why, in an appropriate case falling within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, can the proceedings not be brought in the Circuit Court? Why, if a Circuit Court judge is competent to give a decree in a matter for £29,000, is he not competent to deal with a matter arising under the Competition Bill?  It does not add up.</P>
    <P>A small company could be affected in a modest way by an anti-competitive practice resulting in, say, loss of profits or damage of £1,000.  That would be well within the jurisdiction of the District Court, not to mention the Circuit Court. Are we going to provide that that person should pay £20,000 or £50,000 in a high risk action in the High Court when all he has lost is £1,000 and all he seeks to recover is £1,000?  That is what would <Col N="1829" /> happen if we provide that all these cases must go to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that the District Court does not have jurisdiction at present to grant injunctions, and I concede that.  That is the reason I wrote into my amendment the fact that injunction relief should not be given through the District Court.  If somebody needs an injunction in a modest case they could get it in the Circuit Court which would be much cheaper than going to the High Court.  The jurisdictions of the courts are being expanded by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, and rightly so.  That is a vote of confidence in the lower courts and it is well warranted. There is a fine team of justices in the District Court and judges in the Circuit Court.  District justices, for the most part, have been solicitors and some have been junior counsel.  Most of the judges appointed to the Circuit Court have been senior counsel although some might have been junior counsel.  These people are well able to handle claims for damages of up to £30,000, in all kinds of actions such as libel, contract, tort and so on, but for some reason a claim for damages under the Competition Bill is so special that Circuit Court judges and district justices are disqualified from taking these cases.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about recovering damages &mdash; that is what we are talking about &mdash; it is specifically provided for in the section.  As I said, why should a person who has suffered damages to the extent of £500 have to pay thousands of pounds in costs by bringing his case to the High Court?  I see no reason for that.  The whole structure of this Bill is law-orientated, forcing ordinary citizens and ordinary companies into the courts rather than putting some measure of responsibility on to the Authority.  That is compounded by providing that not alone must the company or the citizen go to court but they must go to the High Court irrespective of the amount they seek to recover in damages.  Whether they are looking for £100,000 or £500 they would have to go to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The whole basis of having a hierarchical court structure is that small <Col N="1830" /> claims are dealt with in the District Court, moderate size claims in the Circuit Court, and very substantial claims in the High Court.  Some of the matters that will arise under this Bill will of course be very substantial and will warrant the case going to the High Court.  By reason of jurisdictional constraints alone they will have to go to the High Court.  There will be a few such cases, but of all the cases that will be brought under this Bill the overwhelming majority would be well within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and very many of them could well be within the expanded jurisdiction of the District Court.  Why compel somebody to go to the High Court when they would be happy to have their case disposed of in the modest jurisdiction of the District Court or when the damages they seek do not exceed what comes within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court?  Maybe there is an explanation for this but I cannot imagine what it can be.</P>

      <P>Deputy Taylor has made this case much more eloquently than I could.  I cannot see the logic of having to bring these cases to the High Court, with all the costs involved.  Perhaps when the Minister replies to Deputy Taylor's amendment he will explain this to us.  I thought I had a very good case earlier today when I was thinking in terms of the cost of going to the High Court but having listened to Deputy Taylor talk about somebody having to put together £20,000 to take a case to the High Court it seems to make the argument for bringing the smaller cases to the Circuit Court or the District Court much more compelling.  I strongly support this amendment.  I have not heard the Minister justify the reason all these cases should be brought to the High Court rather than the Circuit Court or District Court but perhaps he will do so now.  Pending that, I am persuaded by the logic of Deputy Taylor's argument and I support his amendment.</P>

      <P>My anxiety always has been to try to have matters in dispute that have to be adjudicated on in courts decided in the lowest possible court.  In <Col N="1831" /> the legal sense I believe in the principle of subsidiarity even though it is rather difficult to practice subsidiarity when it comes to the law because the force of gravity is upwards and onwards as far as courts are concerned.  I thought therefore that an appropriate court for this type of action would be the Circuit Court.  I have heard many complaints about how complex this Bill is, how new it is, with all the different concepts, new law and foreign law &mdash; by foreign law I mean non-Irish and non-English law, but continental law.  It seems that in the early years at least, until the jurisprudence within Ireland on this sort of topic has developed, the appropriate place to have decisions made on disputes that will arise under this Bill is in the High Court.  The High Court already has some experience, in some cases quite a bit of experience, of dealing with Articles 85 and 86 in so far as they relate to Community law. However, I do not think that in the longer term, when the jurisprudence has been established here and the workings of the Authority and their relationship with the courts have been established, that the High Court should retain exclusive jurisdiction. After a period of about three years, which I think would be an appropriate amount of time to enable the jurisprudence to develop, the Circuit Court could be given jurisdiction up to the limit of its civil jurisdiction, in other words, for cases of up to £30,000 and for injunctions relating to those cases.  I do not recognise, either now or in the future, any argument for having any such cases heard in the District Court.  The District Court would not be a suitable forum, and the principal relief, that of injunction, would not be available there anyway.  It would not be worth pursuing separate claims for damages there, and I do not think that, either now or in the future the District Court should have jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change after three years could be made by regulation by the Minister.  I am not certain that the Minister's present regulation-making powers would cover that position fully.  I will consider the matter between now and Report Stage <Col N="1832" /> in order to ensure that such power is available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I would be too happy with the giving of a regulation-making power to make a change in the venue of court that would be appropriate to hear particular cases.  That might be spreading power a little too wide.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the District Court would never be an appropriate court to have anything to do with the Competition Bill because it would not be possible to gain injunctive relief through the District Court.  He is quite right, the District Court does not have power to grant injunctions.  However, there could be many cases in which a person or small company does not want or need an injunction.  For example there could be a case in which injury or damage was done to a company by an anti-competitive practice which resulted in a loss of £1,000 to that company.  It could be that after complaint was made the anti-competitive practice ceased and all that was left for resolution was the company's loss of £1,000, which they wanted to recover. No question of an injunction would then arise.  Why should that company not be able to bring their small claim of £1,000 to the District Court?  Why should they have to be intimidated by the prospect of a case in the High Court or even the Circuit Court either then or three years on?  It would be all right to send such a company to the Circuit Court if they were suffering continued losses as a result of the anti-competitive practice being ongoing and needing an injunction.  It would be all right for the Circuit Court to be the appropriate forum then, even if the loss were only £1,000, if an injunction was needed: that would be fair enough, I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To say, as the Minister says, that in three years time the legislation will be changed to extend the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court &mdash; that is new &mdash; appears to imply that Circuit Court judges are not competent at present to deal with matters under this legislation.  If one gets to the bottom of the issue that is clearly what it <Col N="1833" /> amounts to.  Will Circuit Court judges be any more competent in three years time than they are now when they have not been dealing with any such cases in the meantime?  I do not think so, but I take the view that Circuit Court judges are now perfectly competent to deal with any matter that might arise under the legislation. Indeed, in so far as small cases are concerned, District Justices would be well competent to determine whether there had been an abuse of a dominant position or whether an anti-competitive practice had been undertaken.  They would have the aid of expert witnesses; witnesses who would, unfortunately have to be produced in any court to back up a case.  Circuit Court judges would be well competent to do that now.  They are experienced lawyers, most of them having been in practice for the major part of their lives.  The judges have to have been in practice for ten or 12 years &mdash; I cannot remember the exact period &mdash; and most of them, if not all of them, are qualified senior counsel who have practised at the bar for many years.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not pertain to Articles 85 and 86.  I do not think that reference to Article 85 and 86 appears anywhere in the Bill.  The legislation to be interpreted is this Bill as it goes before the courts in the form of an Act.  Any lawyer worth his salt, solicitor or barrister, would be well capable of interpreting the legislation studying it and arguing it out before a court.</P>
    <P>In my view, it is a travesty to compel small claimants who have a genuine claim and wish to have resort to justice under this law, as it will be, to go to the High Court.  In the overwhelming bulk of cases the effect of that ruling would be to deprive an individual or a small company of their rights under the law.  In most cases if people were given the choice of going to the High Court or going nowhere, then they would go nowhere.</P>
    <P>The body of law that has arisen in Europe under Articles 85 and 86 would certainly be of interest in the interpretation of this legislation, but it would not necessarily be followed as absolutely binding.  It is this legislation that the <Col N="1834" /> courts would consider in the determination of claims for damages or claims for injunctions.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment has overwhelming merit and the Minister should reconsider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Minister and Deputy Taylor know more about the judges and the hierarchy of the courts than I do, but it appears to me from what I do know that the competence and the background of both Circuit Court judges and High Court judges are broadly similar. They all seem to be extremely competent. They are well qualified and intellectually quite capable, both from experience and from their level of knowledge and training, to deal with anything that might crop up under this section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Being already persuaded of that in my mind, I am now even more persuaded because of the difference in cost between the Circuit Court and the High Court. There are potentially huge costs attached to the Bill.  The type of cases referred to by Deputy Taylor would end up in the High Court anyway.  They would be serious cases involving very big companies seeking to protect their position in the market.  Those companies would be willing to pay the cost involved in going to the High Court.  There will be smaller cases, particularly and unfortunately in the three years to which the Minister refers.  The difficulties will arise in the first three years, when people will be in doubt and actions will be taken.  A case might be taken against an authority that has tried to impose conditions on firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who have been influencing my thinking during the whole debate are small business people.  It would be ludicrous to send a case involving £20,000 to a court where costs would amount to £20,000.  I hope the Minister will accept what Deputy Taylor is saying and accept the amendment to deal with cases in the Circuit Court.  I am not sure that Deputy Taylor has accepted the Minister's point about the District Court and I am not <Col N="1835" /> competent to give a judgment on that matter, but I hope the Minister will accept Deputy Taylor's point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister was offering the Circuit Court as a compromise position.  I forgot to mention earlier that it is an axiom of going to law that when one sets out to enter the field of battle in the law courts one must think not only of the hearing in the court but of the possibility of ending up on appeal, either because one loses or because one wins and one's opponent appeals the case, in a higher court.  That must be taken into account before one starts off down that road.  It follows that if this Bill is left in its present form where one can only start in the High Court, an appeal ends up in the Supreme Court. One is getting into mindboggling figures when one talks about Supreme Court costs on top of High Court costs.  There is also a delay factor.  There is a waiting time of about two years to get a case before the Supreme Court.  It takes long enough to bring a case to the High Court although now extra judges are being appointed to the High Court.  There is only one Supreme Court, however, and there is a very long waiting list there.</P>
      <P>What will happen if every simple little trifling case, well within the jurisdiction of even the District Court, can potentially end up in the Supreme Court?  Who does that favour, the small person or the big multinational company?  The big multinational company is the winner all along the line.  A multinational can resist either the High Court or the Supreme Court.  A small person looking for £1,000 damages from a multinational will not take them on in the High Court or the Supreme Court because of the costs.  They might take them on in the District Court and perhaps in the Circuit Court although that could end up in the High Court.  It would be grossly unfair to leave small people in that position.  If the Minister has this slight concern that it would take Circuit Court judges three years to learn the ropes of this Bill &mdash; an unfair comment I would suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not make the comment, Deputy, but the Deputy's miser-able style is always to attribute these sort of views and innuendos to other people who did not say any such thing.  I am well used to listening to the Deputy and his snide remarks.  That is one of the reasons, unfortunately, these debates are less pleasant than they otherwise might be.</P>

      <P>The question of pleasantness or otherwise is not the point.  We are trying to improve the legislation.  If the Minister was more responsive one could try to make a contribution that would put something into the Bill, particularly when politics is not involved and all we are engaging in here is trying to put what knowledge or experience one has of these things forward for the benefit of the House.  I have 40 years experience of dealing with these kinds of matters, so I know a little bit about them.  I am quite convinced that the Circuit Court are well able to hear these cases, particularly when one takes into account that if the Circuit Court judge gets the decision wrong, as can happen, there is the safety measure that it can be appealed in the High Court, rather than having to end up in the Supreme Court.  That is what I am trying to say and it is a fair and reasonable point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>A further point in support of what Deputy Taylor is saying is that the High Court sits only in Dublin permanently. It goes around the country as well, but it only sits in Dublin permanently. That is a constant cause for complaint in Cork and probably in other areas.  If one has a High Court case one is told that it will take two and a half years before it can be brought before the High Court in Cork but that if one wants to go to the High Court in Dublin one may be able to get to the list in a year and a half.  Of course if one does that one must bring all one's witnesses to Dublin and be subject to all the extra costs of doing so.  I am appealing at the moment to another Minister to try to get a permanent High Court in Cork.  I do not <Col N="1837" /> know in what other parts of the country the Circuit Court sits, but I imagine that Circuit Courts are dotted around the country and they could hear cases in different areas rather than bringing everybody to Dublin for the High Court. That is another argument in favour of dealing with this in the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make the remark about Circuit Court judges which Deputy Taylor in his inimitable style attributes to me.  I have no reason to believe that they are not people of the highest competence but, as I have already pointed out, this is a very new field of law.  It is not based on Irish or English law.  It is based on European law.  Deputy Taylor incorrectly makes the point that judges will be concerned only with this Bill.  I have already made it abundantly clear that we will be concerned with all the judgments of the European Court over the past 35 years on Articles 85 and 86.  Articles 85 and 86 will be referred to in all these cases as will all the judgments of the European Court of Justice as apply to this country by the statutory instrument of 29 December 1972.  Not for the first time, Deputy Taylor is completely erroneous in what he suggests in regard to this matter.  It is appropriate therefore that the basic jurisprudence in this country should be worked out in the High Court.  I am conscious of the costs involved but I do not accept that they are anything like what Deputy Taylor describes.  There is no question, in case people think it from reading what he said, that one must put up £20,000 cash to go to the High Court.  There are thousands of cases in the High Court every year from people in all walks of life, including the very poorest people.  I have no reason to believe that the same cannot apply here.  It is more expensive, there is no doubt about it, but when the jurisprudence is developed it is appropriate that there should be a concurrent jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.  I said that in my earlier intervention on this amendment and I would have thought that Deputy Taylor would be glad of my <Col N="1838" /> remarks.  However, he adopts this harping attitude, unfortunately, which seems to be part and parcel of his approach to debates here.  That is a pity because I have shown my openmindness in regard to this and I am prepared to make the advantages of this Bill as widely and as cheaply available as I can.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt this ramble round rural Ireland but I should like to get back to the reason for the Minister's extraordinary tetchiness, which seems unreasonable in the context of Deputy Taylor's amendment.  The efficacy of the Bill presumes that section 6 can be invoked when the necessity arises, that the aggrieved person, corporate or otherwise, can have resort to the court to vindicate their rights under this legislation. I would have thought that a very <Col N="1839" /> compelling case has been made that it may well be beyond the capacity of a great many small traders or suppliers to do that.  On the one hand the Minister indicated to the House his amazement and bafflement that we are all making such a meal of this Bill and complaining we are getting inadequate time and on the other hand he tells us we are following 34 years of well established precedent in European courts.  He said that there is nothing new here but he demonstrates a great lack of conviction in the system to quickly assimilate these decisions and apply them in the Irish situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that the jurisdictional limits in the case of the District Court and the Circuit Court automatically place a limit on the cases that might be tried there and would avoid the prospect which Deputy Taylor, quite reasonably, holds out.  Deputy Taylor's amendment specifically excludes relief by way of injunctions, as provided in the relevant subsection, being granted in the <Col N="1840" /> District Court.  I cannot recall if the Minister accepted a single amendment since we started; if he did it was of very minor import.  Admittedly, he tabled some amendments which had obviously been informed by the debate on Second Stage and representations made to him.  If the Minister is saying that Deputies on this side of the House are deliberately dragging this out or that we are not raising real fears, I predict that, as soon as this Bill is enacted, there will be an outcry about an action under section 6 having to be brought to the High Court in the first instance.  That is inevitable.  What is the point of the Bill, by which the Minister sets so much store, if one's rights cannot be vindicated in a fashion within one's financial grasp?</P>
    <P>The amendment is an eminently reasonable one and I cannot understand why the Minister is so opposed to it.  I also cannot understand why he is to tetchy in regard to the arguments advanced in support of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Just two weeks ago, during Question Time, my colleague Deputy Rabbitte drew to the attention of the Minister for Labour the appalling treatment of a group of young Irish workers who had been sent by FÁS to work in a company in Munich.  He outlined major <Col N="1845" /> problems regarding wages, accommodation, washing facilities and said that they felt they had been seriously misled by FÁS.</P>
      <P>I again draw to the attention of the Minister the shocking treatment of yet another group of Irish workers who were also sent to Germany by FÁS.  This group were skilled workers, including electricians, toolmakers, carpenters and a constituent of mine who was a sheet metal worker with ten years experience. They were recruited by FÁS under a programme called, I believe, the Second Programme for Master Craftsmen &mdash; Germany, which is supposed to involve sending skilled workers to Germany to allow them to improve their skills and to bring them up to master craftsmen level.</P>
      <P>They went to Germany after undertaking a four week language training course in FÁS in Baldoyle.  Before they left they got nothing in writing from FÁS, simply a verbal indication of where they would be working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full details of the appalling treatment of these workers is too complicated to go into in full in the time available here tonight, but I am quite prepared to make it available to the Minister in full. However, the main problems were as follows: Some of the men were not employed in any skilled work in their area of expertise.  They were asked to undertake unskilled menial work in what can only be described as back street-garage type operations; they were initially paid only 120 DM per week (about £50), although this was doubled when the workers complained; after being initially accommodated in a college, about which they had no complaints, they were put up in a hostel where the living conditions were dreadful.  In the case of my constituent he was sharing with seven other workers, making a total of eight in a room measuring only around 15 ft. by 20 ft, which also included bunks, a sink unit, three wardrobes and chairs; their German contact, who I understand was an agent of the local chamber of commerce, was most unhelpful, providing little or no information.  On some occasions the Irish workers were asked to sign documents in German, which were not translated for them; although <Col N="1846" /> based originally in Cologne, my constituent was on a number of occasions taken to locations up to 120 miles away to work with small family concerns.  In one case, the family had no spare accommodation of their own, and the FÁS worker had to be put up with a neighbour in a room which was a converted bathroom and which was initially without even a bed.  On some of their jobs, the workers were paid as little as 12 DM per hour, although I understand that the legal minimum is 16 DM per hour; while all this was going on, there was no contact whatsoever with FÁS.  When eventually they managed to make contact by phone with FÁS in Dublin, they got little attention or sympathy, although a FÁS representative from Cork did arrive to follow up on complaints about the treatment of a separate group of Irish apprentices.</P>
    <P>I believe that the treatment of these workers was so appalling that FÁS should immediately end this particular programme and review all its procedures for sending Irish workers abroad.  My understanding is that the programme was originally introduced when Germany needed skilled workers and was glad to take tradesmen from Ireland.  However, following on German unification there is apparently plenty of skilled labour available from the former GDR.  There is no skilled work available for Irish workers, certainly nothing that will increase their training and skills as promised and they are, therefore, shamelessly being used and exploited as cheap labour.</P>
    <P>The obligations of FÁS to those whom they send to work abroad should not end once they leave Irish territory.  If FÁS are to continue to send people abroad they must ensure that the working and living conditions are of an acceptable standard, and that they are supervised by FÁS representatives.  They must also ensure that there are clear complaint procedures where workers run into difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reply on behalf of the Minister for Labour who is abroad at present on official Government business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Labour indicated in reply to a recent parliamentary question, <Col N="1847" /> freedom of movement within the European Community is guaranteed under Articles 48 to 51 of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The detailed provisions relating to the exercise of that right are contained in Regulation (EEC) No. 1612/68 of 15 October 1968.  Under the regulation, any national of a member state has the right to seek and to take up employment in another member state on the same terms and under the same conditions as nationals of that member state.</P>
    <P>The regulation also provides that employers in a member state may not discriminate between one EC national and another on grounds of nationality.  In practice, this means that an Irish national seeking employment in another member state has the right to look for work on the same basis as a national of the host country.  Irish nationals who find employment with an employer in another EC member state are covered by the protective legislation of that state and, where differences or disputes arise, have the same remedies open to them as local people.</P>
    <P>The Minister's advice to anyone contemplating employment abroad is that they should insist on obtaining in advance a written statement of the wages and conditions attaching to the job in question, including details of accommodation to be provided, if appropriate.</P>
    <P>Where employment abroad is obtained through SEDOC, the EC sponsored placement service operated by FÁS, it is possible for FÁS to have any complaints investigated should misunderstandings or difficulties subsequently arise.  I must emphasise, however, that FÁS's role is that of a referral agency and that they are not in a position to vet and validate the terms and conditions of employment of all the 5,000 job vacancies notified to them under the SEDOC system.</P>
    <P>As with employment in Ireland, the contract is between the job seekers and the employer.  However, where FÁS have been involved in putting Irish workers in touch with an employer in another member state, they arrange to supply them with the name of a local employment officer in the state employment authority to deal with any queries <Col N="1848" /> or problems that may arise.  Experience to date suggests that the system works satisfactorily since the number of complaints received is negligible, given that the number of Irish nationals placed in jobs under the SEDOC system is of the order of 2,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Due to language problems, misunderstandings can arise from time to time and the Minister is aware of certain difficulties encountered by a number of workers in Germany.  Under the bilateral arrangements which I have described, these complaints are being investigated by the regional labour office.  FÁS have kept in touch with the situation and were instrumental in having the initial problems which arose at the time resolved.</P>
    <P>The Minister has arranged to have the report of the German authorities examined in due course.  If it transpires that any action at ministerial or official level might be feasible which would help to prevent or eliminate such misunderstandings the Minister for Labour will not hesitate to undertake such action.</P>

    <Title>Closure of Briquette Factories.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonight I raise a most important matter affecting two important factories in County Offaly.  This evening Derrinlough and Croghan briquette factories ceased to function and are closed for the next 18 weeks, save for maintenance staff in each factory.</P>
      <P>There are four briquette factories in the country &mdash; Derrinlough, Croghan, Lullymore and Littleton.  In 1988 and 1989 the sales of briquettes were £23.4 million and they accounted for 20 per cent of the company's total sales.</P>
      <P>My reasons for opposing the closure of Derrinlough and Croghan briquette factories are as follow.  Approximately 60 workers will be laid off in Derrinlough and approximately 45 workers will be laid off in Croghan at a time when they should be at peak production during the summer months.  The Government must be aware that such job losses across Offaly are a matter of deep concern to me as somebody elected by the people of Offaly to speak on their behalf in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposed to these closures.  I believe they are wrong and unnecessary. <Col N="1849" /> Unemployment is already too high in the country.  These lay-offs will aggravate further an already difficult situation, made even worse by the announcement yesterday about Atlantic Mills, a textile firm in Tullamore which is laying off approximately 35 workers.</P>
    <P>I have already written to the managing director of Bord na Móna and asked him to reconsider the decision to close Derrinlough and Croghan briquette factories.</P>
    <P>My main reason for raising this matter here tonight is to bring to the attention of the Minister for Energy, as a member of the Government, some points I believe are of the utmost importance.  Briquettes and turf are indigenous fuels which provide a great number of jobs in the midlands. Jobs are high on Fine Gael's priority list, as is a clean environment. The Government speak about a clean environment, yet not alone are they allowing a tax on briquettes and turf but they have increased VAT from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Burning briquettes and turf benefits the economy by savings on imports of coal and oil.  The Government are imposing a tax on environment friendly fuel.  Briquettes and turf should be zero rated and if there is some difficulty with this under EC law, then the maximum VAT rate should be 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the last three to four years nearly 2,000 jobs have been lost in Bord na Móna, which has had a very severe impact on the economy of the midlands. It has been a major disappointment to Bord na Móna, the people of Offaly and the people of the midlands, that the Government did not provide any type of material support for Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna's financial position was due in large measure to their making major investments in indigenous resources as part of the Government's energy policy, but now that international energy prices have fallen Bord na Móna and their staff have been left high and dry by both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Bord na Móna are handicapped by a huge debt of about £100 million which costs the company approximately £22 million in interest repayments each year.</P>
    <P>In speaking for the people of Offaly, <Col N="1850" /> and particularly the workers in Derrinlough and Croghan, let me say that even at this stage the Government should recognise the importance of maintaining our four existing briquette factories. Briquettes and turf are indigenous, clean fuels.  Natural gas is equally clean, and it is Irish.  BGE gave a £600 voucher to encourage people to install the natural gas in their homes and allowed a 50 per cent discount on therms used above a certain figure.  Rather than letting go 100 workers in County Offaly, the Government should display an understanding of the seriousness of what is happening to Bord na Móna.  Their sales in Derrinlough have been excellent and there are also excellent staff-customer relationships. Sales in Croghan have been equally good and there is a similarly good relationship there between staff and customers. Bord na Móna workers and staff have made tremendous sacrifices to ensure the survival of their jobs and of the company.  Such efforts deserve a much better response from the Government than being told they are to go on the dole for four months.</P>
    <P>I have known Bord na Móna workers over the years and they take pride in their work and in their company.  They never wanted the dole.  These factories should be kept open and the Government have it in their power to ensure that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to ensure the facts are presented to the House, let me say at the outset that briquette production capacity in the four factories, Littleton, Derrinlough, Croghan and Lullymore, amounts to 568,000 tonnes per annum while the estimated volume of sales in the current year is 396,000 tonnes.  I should make it clear that the temporary closures of the factories is a decision made by the board as part of their day-to-day activities and thus did not require my consent as Minister for Energy or that of the Government.  It would be quite improper of me &mdash; and I do not believe that the House would find it acceptable either &mdash; to seek to interfere with the board carrying out their statutory functions.  Nevertheless the board have notified me of their proposals in <Col N="1851" /> view of the importance of the matter to the workers concerned.</P>
      <P>I think it is important that the temporary closure of the company's four briquette factories at Derrinlough, Croghan, Littleton and Lullymore be viewed in its proper context.  This decision by the board stems from the company's recurrent problem of briquette production over-capacity combined with a high level of stocks on hand at present.  It also takes account of the board's need to tackle the current high level of borrowings.</P>
      <P>While I fully appreciate and share the Deputy's concern for the effects of these closures on the workforce and on the local communities, I believe that the board's emphasis on improving the profitability of the company, while it may have painful effects in the short term, represents the best means of ensuring the long term viability of the company.  The Government are determined to ensure that Bord na Móna should be in a position to continue to make a significant contribution towards the national energy requirement and in doing so provide viable and sustainable employment.</P>
      <P>The House will be well aware that Bord na Móna have encountered severe financial difficulties in recent years.  The board and management have undertaken, with the co-operation of the workforce, a major reorganisation and restructuring designed to address these problems.  The company has been divided into three divisions, dealing with separate areas of its operations.  Worker enterprise schemes, new technologies and a number of other operational measures have been introduced in order to improve efficiency.  All of these measures are designed to ensure that Bord na Móna operate in a commercial fashion and are structured so as to increase competitiveness in the marketplace.  This, in turn, will enable them to maintain secure and viable employment and allow them to continue to contribute to regional and national prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peat will continue to have an important role in the national energy market.  The efficient development of our indigenous energy resources forms a major part of <Col N="1852" /> the Government's energy policy.  The benefits of having this secure sources of indigenous energy are considerable.  It improves the balance of payments situation by reducing our reliance on imported fuels, improves the security of fuel supply and, of course, provides significant economic benefits to the national economy and particularly to the Midlands region.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that there is a serious difficulty with briquette production over-capacity.  The total production capacity in the four briquette factories at Littleton, Derrinlough, Croghan and Lullymore is significantly higher than the company's estimated level of briquette sales.  While the ban on the sale of bituminous coal has enabled the company to increase their share of the solid fuel market in the Dublin market, this increase has been largely offset by the decline in the overall size of the Dublin solid fuel market together with increased competition from private turf producers in rural areas.  The board are fully conscious of the need to consider all options to increase the volume of briquette sales and are actively seeking to do so.</P>
    <P>The temporary closures, for approximately 16 weeks in the case of each factory, have been specifically arranged in order to coincide with the period of lowest sales of briquettes &mdash; the summer season.  I have been advised by the board that the closure period will be used to undertake the annual overhaul of the plants.  This process takes about three weeks and will require the presence of all staff.  In addition, sales will continue during the period of the closure and some necessary administration and security cover will be required.  Having allowed also for three weeks annual leave by all staff and by rotating the available work on sales, administration and security among all the employees, the board estimate that the average length of lay-off per employee will be approximately six weeks.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the current temporary closures are not unique.  There have been similar closures in the past, usually owing to local circumstances.  The Croghan plant, for example, was temporarily closed between December 1989 <Col N="1853" /> and February 1990 owing to their being an excessive build-up of briquette stocks at the factory at that time.  I should point out also that I have been assured by the board that the temporary closures will not affect the company's ability to meet all demands for briquettes in the next heating season.</P>
    <P>The board have acknowledged the contribution being made by the workforce at Derrinlough, Croghan and indeed at all of the other works to this necessary reorganisation of the company.  For my own part, I have been impressed with the way in which the close co-operation between the board and the workforce &mdash; required to ensure the success of the reorganisation &mdash; has been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The position, in summary, is that the temporary closures have been decided on by the board in order to tackle the problem of production over-capacity in the context of an overriding need to reduce their level of borrowings.  The board have arranged these closures to coincide with the period of lowest sales and in a manner specifically designed to minimise the effects on the employees concerned.</P>

    <Title>Irish Red Cross Society Chairman Nomination.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are doing major damage to the Irish Red Cross Society by their failure to propose for nomination, by the President of Ireland, a new chairman for the society. Almost two months ago, on 17 April, a motion of no confidence was passed on the former chairman by the executive committee of the Red Cross Society.  He did not, as would have been expected in certain circumstances, resign at the time. However, his term of office expired on 30 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this background the Government have failed to propose a new chairman for nomination by the President.  It is important to note that the President of Ireland is <i>ex officio</i> President of the Irish Red Cross Society.  This is an indication of the importance of the organisation, and provision for this situation was made in the Red Cross Act, 1944.  The chairman is nominated by the President of the <Col N="1854" /> society but, of course, this is done on the advice of the Government.  In a case such as this, where a motion of no confidence was passed on the former chairman, surely it is all the more important that a replacement would be made without delay.  Indeed the indecisiveness of the Government on such a clear-cut issue must call into question their ability to govern at all.</P>
    <P>The situation of the Red Cross is even more critical because the last straw so far as the executive committee was concerned, in passing the motion of no confidence, was the departure of the former secretary of the Department of Defence, who was acting secretary &mdash; on a non-fee basis.  The crisis thereby created was in the management of the society.  His departure was solely as a result of the activities of the former chairman.</P>
    <P>The result of the delay on the part of the Government is that the society at present has no chairman, vice chairman, treasurer or secretary general.  Their executive committee cannot be reformulated until the Government propose a chairman and appoint the Government nominees to the general council.</P>
    <P>The background is clear.  On 17 April 1991 when the executive committee met to discuss the sudden departure of the acting secretary and the crisis thereby created, a motion of no confidence in the chairman, Mr. Derry O'Donovan was proposed, seconded and adopted by a majority of 9 to 1.  The vote of no confidence was adopted on the grounds that (a) the chairman had tried to usurp the statutory management functions of the executive; (b) he had frustrated valid decisions of the executive; (c) he had regularly demonstrated aggressive and threatening behaviour which, in the opinion of the executive, was totally unbecoming a chairman of the society; and (d) his attitude and management style was not conducive to the effective functioning of a voluntary organisation and were not compatible with the ethos of the Red Cross.</P>
    <P>Following the passage of the motion of no confidence, it was agreed that a letter be sent to the Minister for Defence outlining the decision of the executive committee's apprehension that Mr. <Col N="1855" /> O'Donovan would be reappointed for a further term.  It should also be noted that the executive committee expressed their sincere appreciation of the work carried out by Mr. Scully, the acting secretary, and their anxiety that he should return to the office.</P>
    <P>Because of the rearguard action being fought by and on behalf of Mr. O'Donovan to be reappointed, it is necessary to refer to the motion of no confidence and indeed other aspects of his brief chairmanship. It goes without saying that he is an active member of Fianna Fáil but that in itself is not a problem.  As far as I am concerned everybody is entitled to their own political outlook, but I do say that in chairing such an important organisation, it is, to say the least, unwise for the chairman to flaunt his politics.</P>
    <P>Among the fundamental principles of the International Red Cross are impartiality and independence.  They make no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious belief, class or political opinions.  The movement may not take sides or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.  These principles provide that the national societies must always maintain their autonomy so that they may at all times act in accordance with the principles of the movement.  It was very clear that Mr. Derry O'Donovan from the very beginning went out of his way to literally flaunt his Fianna Fáil connections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to refer to the fact that it was unwise on the part of the chairman to carry on in that fashion.  It was a source of major embarrassment to many of those involved in the organisation. This happened at the time of the resignation of the much respected former chairman, General Hogan, and has continued since the chairman assumed office in succession to him.  It has led to many difficulties for the society.  It is true that the then chairman at an executive committee meeting on 18 October 1990, unreservedly withdrew the remarks earlier made by him and apologised to the representative of the Department of Defence for any offence.  It is a fact that there was a further unreserved apology by the chairman at the national executive committee meeting on 19 November 1990.  This followed a letter of 24 October 1990 to the chairman by and on behalf of the executive committee following their unanimous decision to convey their disapproval of unwarranted threats to members of the central council.  These included a threat to the honorary treasurer to have him politically removed within a week, threats to politically interfere with Government nominees and implied suggestions that the chairman could interfere with the careers of Department of Defence representatives.</P>
      <P>Despite the apology by the then chairman, the problems continued and led ultimately to the motion of no confidence.  It would be altogether unacceptable if the Government were to propose the reappointment of the outgoing chairman against such a background.  This is an important organisation and they cannot and should not have a controversial figure of that kind as their chairman.  I am convinced that if this were to occur, irreparable damage would be done to the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1857" /> With regard to the rearguard action to which I have referred, spurious claims have been made about the record of the then chairman claiming credit for work done by voluntary people.  It has been claimed that he introduced the idea of purchasing local goods&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have to reject these claims.  This work is part of the association's activities.  Despite the amount of money collected subsequently in the Kurdish appeal, the Chairman did not want to launch the appeal in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The Government are guilty of gross negligence and derliction of duty in not facing up to the issue, in not proposing the name of the new chairman for appointment by the President.  They have two options at this stage.  They can confront the issue and end the indecision by appointing a new chairman, a person who could be recognised as one of independence and integrity.  The name of retired High Court Judge, Brian Walsh, has been put forward by some members of the organisation.

I want to put forward a last option for the Government.  They could make it clear to President Robinson that they are not formally putting forward a name for appointment and that she has an independent right to nominate.  Perhaps this would be the best solution of all.  One way or the other, the problem needs to be dealt with now.  If the Government continue with this indecision more and more damage will be caused to that organisation.</P>

      <P>Finally, I should like to say that my Department are in regular contact with the headquarters of the society and are aware that the society are continuing to carry out their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Red Cross Society were established by article 2 of the Irish Red Cross Society Order, 1939, made by the Government pursuant to section I of the Red Cross Act, 1938.  The society are an autonomous body with full powers to manage and administer their affairs through their governing body, the central council.  The central council of the society consists of members elected from the society's areas and members nominated by the Government.  It is statutorily prescribed that not less than one third of the total membership of the council are <Col N="1859" /> nominated by the Government to serve for a three year period.  Currently the society are organised into 24 areas, each of which is entitled to elect one member of the council.  The number of Government nominees will, therefore, be not fewer than 12.</P>
    <P>It is also statutorily prescribed that the chairman of the society shall be a member of the council and shall be nominated by the President of the Society.  The Red Cross Act, 1944, provides that the President of Ireland shall, by virtue of her office, be President of the Society.  The President, acting on the advice of the Government, nominates the Chairperson.</P>
    <P>The society are also continuing to carry out their various activities at local level at home.  Their annual national competitions are in progress, school safety squads are being set up at present throughout the country and a one weeks holiday for the disabled is due to commence next week in Mosney.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to express my sincerest thanks and appreciation to the voluntary workers within the organisation who give so generously of their free time to such a magnificent organisation and to the staff of the society's headquarters.  I should also like to express thanks on behalf of the Irish Red Cross Society to the people of Ireland who have contributed so unselfishly to the many appeals.  Their contributions have saved many lives and relieved much suffering throughout the many disaster stricken areas of the world.</P>
    <P>The Irish Red Cross have responded positively to the various requests received recently for aid.  Six plane loads, one as late as last Friday, filled with medicines, clothing, food, tents and other materials requested by the league and the Iranian Red Crescent Movement have been sent out to Iran for the relief of the refugees there.  In addition, the Irish Red Cross have sent, in the recent past, five plane loads of aid to Romania for distribution to the various institutions and orphanages in need of relief.  The Irish Red Cross have also released moneys to the league and the International Committee of the <Col N="1860" /> Red Cross for humanitarian projects abroad.</P>
    <P>Within the past month, £500,000 has been released by the society of the league and the International Committee of the Red Cross for relief to the Kurds.  An additional £50,000 was released for the provision of aid to the cyclone victims in Bangladesh as well as £40,000 for urgent relief in Africa.  Further requests are in the pipe-line and are being considered for the provision of assistance to countries such as Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, Angola, Mozambique and Liberia.  I am conscious of the necessity to nominate the most suitable person to the position of chairman and to appoint the best persons to the central council of the society. I am fully aware of the excellent work performed abroad in the field of humanitarian assistance and aid by the society and I am concerned that this important work should continue.  The considerable financial grants made by the Government to the society over the last few years for international purposes signifies the high regard in which the society are held.</P>
    <P>The general public also appreciate the important work performed by the society and have, in recent times, contributed many millions of pounds to the society for the serious disasters which have occurred in various parts of the world. The society are in regular contact with the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Geneva and act in accordance with the league's wishes in so far as they respond to the various requests received for aid and assistance to be provided to areas of disasters and conflicts throughout the world, and conform to the fundamental principles of the International Committee of the Red Cross.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief. Lyracrompane national school has no indoor facilities whatsoever.  A general purpose room was approved for the school and was ready to go to tender in 1987 but because of the embargo imposed by the Department of Education on general purposes rooms this facility was not proceeded with.  There are no indoor recreational facilities for the children in the school and they have no facilities to put on school concerts or similar activities. In addition, the local community have no community hall.  All school and community activities have to be held in nearby villages, the nearest of which is six miles away.</P>
      <P>The parents have collected £14,000 and are prepared to give this money to the Department of Education if they will provide this facility.  Otherwise they want the Department to give them permission to go ahead and provide this facility in co-operation with FÁS.  If the Department cannot provide this facility, can the Minister say if FÁS can get involved in the project?</P>

      <P>I have dealt with this matter fully in my reply to the Deputy's questions dated 9 May 1991, and I would refer him to that reply.  As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to a parliamentary question from himself and Deputy Spring on 5 June 1991, the school authorities have requested permission to build a community centre/general purposes room on the site <Col N="1862" /> at their own expense.  This is being considered and a decision will be conveyed at the earliest possible date.  I cannot comment on the involvement of FÁS but I would be happy to discuss this matter further with the Deputy.

      <P>Tá an dá phobalscoil seo tógtha anois le breis agus deich mbliana agus níor críochnaíodh ceachtar acu go fóill.  Maidir le pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair tá an cás go dona ar fad.  Cé go bhfuil an scoil tógtha ó 1980 níl áiseanna riachtanacha mar halla spóirt ná páirceanna imeartha ar fáil do na daltaí.  Bíonn orthu taisteal na mílte go rialta gach seachtain le cluichí a imirt agus corpoideachas a chleachtadh.  Faoi láthair tá leabharlann na scoile in úsáid mar ghnáthsheomra ranga agus bíonn ar na daltaí go minic a lón a ithe amuigh sa chearnóg mar nach bhfuil seomra oiriúnach taobh istigh.  Cé go bhfuil ardcháil agus ardchaighdeán bainte amach ag pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair, ó thaobh drámaíochta agus ceoil de, níl fiú amháin ardán sa scoil ná halla le cleachtadh a dhéanamh. Tá timpeallacht na scoile garbh, bog, fliuch, agus d'fhéadfá a rá nár críochnaíodh an taobh amuigh den scoil riamh. Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Roinn Oideachais airgead a chur ar fáil láithreach chun na háiseanna seo a thógáil.  Rachadh an halla spóirt chun tairbhe, ní amháin do dhaltaí na pobalscoile, ach freisin dóibh siúd atá ag freastal ar scoil náisiúnta Adhnáin an Luinneáin, is é sin, 510 dalta ar fad idir an dá scoil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem in this case is the product of success.  St. Mary's College, Ballisodare, post-primary centre keeps outgrowing itself.  The new school was built to accommodate 270-280 pupils, but each year the numbers increase.  In 1983-84 there were 283 pupils in the school, just the right number for the present school building, but the number of pupils has increased to 410 in 1991. The first year enrolment alone for the coming year is 106, bringing the total enrolment to about 438, excluding repeat leaving certificate students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this increase in numbers is that in the area, unlike most other parts of the west, there has been a substantial increase in population with many families moving in.  For instance, one feeder national school in Carraroe was a two-teacher school not long ago but now it has eight teachers plus the principal.  The <Col N="1864" /> main reason, however, for the increase in numbers is the outstanding success and reputation St. Mary's College has rightfully gained as a centre of learning and training for second level students.  This has been achieved by a dedicated and talented staff working under inferior conditions. Some of the old vacated buildings had to be brought back into use, otherwise students would have to be turned away.</P>
    <P>What is needed to cater for the present numbers is four new classrooms, a science laboratory, computer room and assembly room.  There is no assembly hall big enough to assemble all the students at the one time.  The Minister for Education is very familiar with the position there, and indeed recently opened the extension with her usual style and panache. Sister Bernadette and her staff have a very strong back-up from a parents' association who are ready again to fund-raise so that no students will be turned away from the school of their choice.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the problem is the product of success.  I know that the Minister will agree that accommodation is needed.  An enrolment of 438 pupils in a school built for 270 pupils is not acceptable.  The only argument that could be advanced against the request for extra accommodation is that St. Mary's got a new school building only a short time ago, but in the light of the evidence of the roll books this is not a valid argument. I appeal to the Minister to give favourable consideration to the submission made by St. Mary's College.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">

      <P>An application has only recently been received from the school authorities for grant aid towards the provision of additional accommodation at St. Mary's College, Ballisodare.  This application is currently being examined in the planning and building unit of my Department. This examination involves an assessment of the precise accommodation needs of the school, taking account of projected short and long term enrolments in the light of declining demographic trends throughout the country and the existing accommodation in the school.  As soon as the accommodation requirements of the school have been <Col N="1865" /> established, the school authorities will be notified of the Department's decision regarding the application for a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise with the Minister the dreadful condition of the boys' and girls' central national school in Ballybay, County Monaghan.  The school was built in 1975 and today it is rot-infested and ready to fall.  The fact that public money was wasted in this way by the Department of Education must be investigated.  However, the urgency now is to provide habitable accommodation for the students and teachers when the new term begins in September.</P>
      <P>The building was found to be unsuitable for use as a school by the area medical officer in June 1989.  A further inspection carried out in May this year found that the condition of the building had further deteriorated.  According to the area medical officer, areas of moisture and dampness are visible on all surfaces inside the building.  There is a strong smell of mould and decay in all the rooms and a mouldy growth is visible on all the internal walls and ceilings.  The atmosphere in the school is unhealthy and I am informed that children suffering from asthma and hay fever should not attend school in the building.  Flus and colds flourish in those conditions and parents are concerned about the frequency of sickness among the children.</P>
      <P>Discussions have been going on with the Department since January 1986.  Why has nothing happened since then?  Will the school have to fall down before action is taken?  I want the Minister to decide at once whether the school is capable of being repaired and, if so, to immediately set about doing the job.  If it is not capable of being repaired, as many people believe, the school will have to be replaced immediately.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of making a statement regarding Ballybay boys' and girls' national school in County Monaghan. I have studied the various reports and am fully aware of the position.  I share the concern of the school authorities and that of the Deputy regarding the condition of those relatively new buildings. <Col N="1866" /> It is relevant, as the Deputy pointed out, that the buildings were erected in 1975. They were designed, erected and supervised by an architect in private practice who was engaged by the school authorities at the time.  My Department have been involved in ongoing consultations with the chairperson of the board of management and have given him the necessary advice regarding all aspects of this very difficult case.</P>
      <P>I accept generally that remedial works are necessary and my Department's architects have undertaken detailed investigations in the matter.  The whole case needs to be further considered in the light of all the circumstances and my Department will communicate with the schools' authorities at the earliest possible date regarding the question of grant assistance.</P>
      <P>I also point out that the Minister herself has agreed to meet a deputation on Tuesday next regarding the school and will personally hear the case that has been put forward.</P>

      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise the building of the new primary school at Portumna, County Galway.  As the Minister and, both junior Ministers are aware, the welcome news reached Portumna on Monday that approval had been given for a new school.  However, only very sketchy details were announced.</P>
      <P>The parents, teachers, management board and the general community want to know, as I do, when the school will be built.  When will the official letter from the Department of Education reach the manager of the school stating that approval has been given?  Within what time frame will the school be completed? Can Portumna expect their new school by 1992?  Will this be put in writing?  Will the new building be a central school taking in outlying existing schools such as Boula and Gortanumera?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parents in Portumna are sceptical about <Col N="1867" /> promises.  They point out that they were promised the school in 1979 if they got a suitable site.  The site was obtained but the years just rolled on with no results whatsoever.</P>
    <P>For the record, I want the Minister to know that the present girls' national school is a fire hazard, and because it is a two-storey building a fire could cause death or severe injury.  The building is damp, the sewerage system is faulty and pupils and teachers should not have to tolerate these conditions any longer.  The Ministers answers to my questions will be read with great interest tonight in Portumna.</P>

After all, the Deputy has been in the Oireachtas for 14 years, four-and-a-half of those years having been in Government. This evening I studied the file to find out whether any impact had been made during those four-and-a-half years. In fact, there had been very little impact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  It would be fair to say that the school was a little way down on the list of priorities in the past few years, because other schools throughout the county and the country in general were in a worse condition and also, in fairness, because genuine difficulties were encountered with several of the sites that were selected and later found to be unsuitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am glad to inform the Deputy tonight that I have approved the provision of a new central school at Portumna that will cater for the amalgamation of the boys' national school and the convent national school.  My Department will contact the schools' authorities at an early date preparatory to putting the architectural planning for the project <Col N="1868" /> in hand.  I fully realise the urgency of the case.</P>

      <P>I have given careful consideration to the recommendation made by the Commission on Health Funding in relation to the publication of maximum waiting periods for access to specific non-emergency procedures.  I understand that <Col N="1649" /> the thinking behind the commission's recommendation was that the setting of maximum waiting periods would facilitate the monitoring of the performance of health agencies in meeting overall service objectives, particularly as regards the objective of ensuring equitable access to hospital services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government, in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, announced that their proposals for the reorganisation of the health services, which are at present being finalised, included the establishment of a performance audit unit to assist in assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of health agencies.  It will be a matter for this new unit, therefore, to devise appropriate mechanisms and criteria for performance monitoring.</P>
      <P>Maximum waiting periods, as envisaged by the commission, were intended as a monitoring tool for management rather than a guide for individual patients.  In the case of patients, the maximum safe waiting period for elective surgery will very greatly depending on the precise medical condition of the individual patient.  The admission of a patient to hospital is a clinical decision for the consultant in charge of the case.  Waiting lists are kept under review and priority is given to urgent cases.  Should a patient's condition deteriorate, it is open to his general practitioner to contact his consultant with a view to expediting matters.</P>

      <P>The determination of entry requirements for nurse training is a matter for An Bord <Col N="1650" /> Altranais in accordance with their statutory functions under the Nurses Act, 1985.  I understand that under the existing rules of An Bord Altranais, the requirement that a candidate must have achieved at least two honours in the leaving certificate does not apply to mature students. Accordingly, it is open to each nurse training school to have regard to the previous experience of such candidates.</P>
      <P>A major review of nurse education and training is currently being undertaken by An Bord Altranais.  Conditions for entry to training are within the remit of this review.  In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further statements on the matter at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy of my Department for many years that persons with mental handicap should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals unless they cannot receive psychiatric care in any other way. Where patients have been admitted to a psychiatric hospital, health boards have been encouraged to care for the mentally handicapped in separate accommodation and to develop programmes of activity suited to their needs.</P>
      <P>In some cases health boards, with my Department's agreement, have separated the care of the mentally handicapped entirely from the rest of the hospital and transferred responsibility for their care to the community care programme, which is responsible for mental handicap services generally in the areas concerned.  I am aware from the reports of the inspector of psychiatric hospitals that a high standard of care is being provided for people with mental handicap in some psychiatric services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services, which I launched recently, endorses this policy. It recommends that an assessment be carried out of the circumstances and needs of each mentally handicapped person in a psychiatric hospital to ensure that people are receiving appropriate care.  If the assessment indicates that it would be inappropriate to transfer the person, he or she will continue to be cared for in the psychiatric services in dedicated accommodation in as homely an environment as possible.  If the assessment indicates that the person with mental handicap no <Col N="1652" /> longer needs care in a psychiatric setting, the report recommends that he or she should transfer to the care of a mental handicap agency.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I have reconstituted the mental handicap co-ordinating committees in each health board area.  The function of these committees is to bring health board and voluntary mental handicap agencies together to plan how best to develop services for persons with mental handicap in each area.</P>
    <P>My Department have recently appointed an adviser with expertise in the care of the mentally handicapped in psychiatric hospitals to work with the health boards and voluntary agencies to further the policy of improving the care of persons with mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> indicates a commitment to transfer persons with mental handicap who are inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals to the care of services for the mentally handicapped.</P>

      <P>I attach great importance to the continued development of quality assurance measures in health care management.  Quality assurance includes such areas as medical audit, outcome review, variations in grades of intervention and specification of standards or targets.  A fundamental component of quality assurance is that of concern for the central position of the patient in all aspects of the organisation and delivery of care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the patients charter which will enshrine this concern and which will be based on the principles <Col N="1653" /> outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will be linked to the implementation of a package of improvements in acute hospital services, including out-patient services as recommended in the reports of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group.  The implementation of the charter will be the responsibility of the health boards and the voluntary hospital authorities in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>On 31 May the board of Cheeverstown House confirmed that it was willing to adhere to the agreement negotiated with the Eastern Health Board in October 1990 through the good offices of the Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with Mental Handicap. The board also confirmed that they agreed to the appointment of a third party nominated by the federation to oversee the implementation of the agreement.</P>
      <P>The federation have invited Justice Declan Costello to act as the third party to facilitate the implementation of the October agreement and adjudicate between the parties if differences of interpretation arise in respect of aspects of the agreement.  The Eastern Health Board have accepted the assurances of the board of Cheeverstown House and the appointment of Justice Costello to oversee the implementation of the agreement.</P>
      <P>The decision of the board of Cheeverstown House has enabled me to recommend to Government that a decision on legislative action be deferred on the basis that the agreement of October 1990 will be successfully implemented.</P>
      <P>A new phase has begun in the relationship of Cheeverstown House and the Eastern Health Board.  The agreement of October 1990 provides for the resolution of the differences between the two bodies.

      <P>On the inception of the GMS scheme in 1972 it was recognised that policy in relation to responsibility for programmes of immunisation, vaccination, and screening services should continue to be arranged through the health boards.  This policy was based on the fact that such services were targeted at specific sectors of the population or, indeed, the total population.</P>
      <P>It was not considered appropriate, therefore, to arrange for the delivery of such services through the GMS scheme for persons with full eligibility status as this scheme covers only 38 per cent of the population.</P>
      <P>Within the context of the on-going discussion regarding the operation of the GMS scheme, the Irish Medical Organisation have requested the inclusion of cervical smear testing on to the list of special items of service within the scheme.  A special sub-group, representative of the IMO and management, are looking at the question of special items of service and matters of additions to the list of those services.  The question of inclusion of smear testing as a special item of service within the GMS will be dealt with in this context.  I have also established a working group on cervical screening who are examining the position regarding provision of the service nationally.</P>
      <P>While cervical screening is not included as a special item for fee purposes, it is currently available through general practitioners, family clinics, maternity and some other hospitals and special clinics organised by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, of course, anxious to ensure that cervical screening services are utilised properly by women most at risk from the <Col N="1656" /> illness and that these women are encouraged to avail of the services provided.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 27, 64, 65 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department met with parents and their mentally handicapped children during their protest in the Department.  I have received a report of the meeting and my Department have taken up the issues raised with the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the present level of service provision needs to be expanded to meet all the needs of people with mental handicap and their families.  I would like to emphasise, however, that funding to mental handicap agencies directly funded by my Department has been increased each year in real terms and is now 40 per cent higher than it was in 1986.  This year's allocation to these agencies is 6 per cent higher than in 1990.  Last year the Government provided in the budget an additional special allocation of £2 million for the development of mental handicap services.  This extra provision enabled an additional 170 residential places, 442 day places, services for 66 families and 25 <Col N="1660" /> staff for other supports to be provided. In this year's budget a further £1 million was provided to build on last year's developments.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government are committed to the development of the mental handicap services.  Officials of my Department have met with each of the health boards to discuss the preparation of plans to implement the commitments of the programme over a seven year period.  These plans will be prepared by the co-ordinating mental handicap committees on which health boards and the voluntary mental handicap agencies are represented.  The provision of sufficient day and residential places for people with mental handicap is one of the priorities to be addressed in these plans.</P>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services was published last month.  This provides a policy framework for the development of services for the next decade and will guide the preparation of the seven year plan referred to above in each health board area.  The recommendations of the review group have been included in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of unrestricted competition in the provision of health insurance being introduced here post-1992, then the VHI will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure their survival in a commercial and competitive <Col N="1662" /> health insurance market.  For some time past I have been aware of the possible repercussions for the VHI arising out of the provision of the EC Third Directive on Non-Life Insurance, which seeks to liberalise the non-life insurance market throughout the Community.  My Department have been represented from the outset on the working group in Brussels which is examining this directive.  A submission has been made to the EC Commission by my Department outlining the case for restricting the health insurance market in Ireland to community rated type schemes only, i.e. the type of health insurance schemes which are operated by the VHI at present.  I am hopeful that we will be successful in this regard.</P>

My Department have requested each health board to prepare detailed strategic plans which will be agreed with the Department and which will form the basis of a phased development of community health services over the seven year period of the programme.  I understand that the South-Eastern Health Board is in the process of preparing such a plan for submission to my Department which will include proposals for the future roles of St. Otteran's and Waterford Regional Hospital and the development generally of psychiatric services in Waterford.  As far as the immediate plans for Belmont Park Hospital are concerned, the Brothers of Charity, who own the hospital, have decided to transfer management of psychiatric and alcoholism services to the South-Eastern Health Board.  The other services, which are mainly for persons with mental handicap, will continue to be provided and developed at Belmont Park.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became Minister in 1987 the food laws have been updated and widely accepted.  I am pleased to report that there are a number of important initiatives under way in my Department with <Col N="1668" /> regard to the updating of the law in relation to food safety.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Advisory Committee are at present reviewing and assessing the adequancy of our existing legislation on food safety.  The committee's membership, which spans a wide range of expertise in the fields of human and veterinary medicine, microbiology, toxicology, food analysis and environmental health, ensures a comprehensive perspective on the many issues which require to be taken into account in this review.</P>
      <P>Among the areas which the committee are addressing is a consolidation involving a review and updating of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950-89.  These regulations set down statutory requirements in relation to food hygiene and food premises and comprise a basic and vital control measure in relation to the protection of public health and safety. The committee's report on this matter will be submitted to both my colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy, Minister for Agriculture and Food, and myself in the near future.  On receipt, the contents will be fully assessed and any measures deemed necessary to further protect public health and safety will be taken.</P>
      <P>The committee have also been involved in drawing up a food inspection programme, a list of official laboratories and the nature of regulations necessary to give effect to the EC directive on the official control of foodstuffs.  The necessary consultation with the various interested parties on the proposed regulations has taken place and I am hoping to make the necessary regulations within weeks.</P>
      <P>In addition, the committee are monitoring developments at EC level, particularly in so far as the updating and consolidation of the law in relation to food additives is concerned.  My Department are currently preparing regulations necessary to give effect to a number of EC directives on food additives and food for those with special dietary needs.  I am hopeful of finalising those issues and introducing the necessary regulations over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a new Food Bill is also <Col N="1669" /> being considered.  Currently the statutory basis for food control is to be found in a number of statutes dating back to 1875 and responsibility for the area is divided among a number of Government Ministers. Because of the importance and high profile of the food industry in this country, it is essential to ensure an up-to-date statutory control system to take account of current food processing and retailing practices.  As already indicated, the multi-disciplinary make-up of the Food Safety Advisory Committee will result in a comprehensive review of the law and provide a substantial basis on which progress can be made to ensure that the controls operated in this country are the most up-to-date and adequate to ensure a safe food supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 59, 66, 67 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>The main financial implication for my Department arising from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> arises from the commitment to a seven year development programme for community-based and associated services. The overall cost of these developments is estimated at an additional capital investment of £100 million at 1990 prices over the course of the seven year programme, and progressive increases in the annual level of current expenditure which will, by the final year of the seven year programme, be £90 million above the present annual level in real terms.</P>
      <P>A significant start has been made this year with the allocation of initial funding of £8 million to begin the implementation of these improvements, and the remainder of the funding will be provided in subsequent budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 47 of the programme relates to the abolition of the income limit for entitlement to category 2 health services. It is important to appreciate that this measure does not involve any change in the existing entitlement to avail of a public bed, which has been enjoyed by the entire population since 1979.  The effect of the measure, and the associated measure in paragraph 48, will be as follows&mdash; everyone, regardless of income, will continue to be entitled to a public bed as a public patient; since 1 June last, those who wish to be public patients are no longer liable for consultants fees, as was the case until now if their income <Col N="1671" /> exceeded £16,700; the availability of public beds for public patients will be increased by changing the present arrangements under which private patients are entitled to avail of public beds.  New arrangements will be phased in under which private patients needing elective i.e. non-emergency treatment will be required to avail of private or semi-private accommodation; emergency cases will continue to be accommodated in whatever bed is available.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these measures is to benefit public patients by ensuring that they have greater access to public beds, since private non-emergency cases will no longer be occupying these beds.  Any increased demand for private beds as a result of the measures will not be at the expense of public beds and will be introduced on a self-funding basis only.</P>
    <P>The new measures relate only to public beds, and I do not expect them to cause any significant reduction in the proportion of the population who are already insured for private and semi-private beds. This view is shared by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and is borne out by independent research.  There is therefore no basis for the suggestion that there will be any significant increase in the demand for public beds.  It follows that the benefits to public patients arising from the measures are likely to be achieved without any need to increase the number of public beds or to incur additional costs in the public hospital system.</P>
    <P>However, the programme contains a commitment to monitor the operation of the new arrangements and I will take whatever action proves necessary in order to ensure that the fundamental objective of equity of access is achieved to the greatest extent possible.</P>

      <Quest>if he has any plans to request the health boards to intensify efforts to detect meat on sale which may have been contaminated by angel dust or other illegal implants, in view of the increasing public concern about the health implications of such sales; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>On-going testing undertaken by veterinary inspectors of the Department of Agriculture and Food in all slaughtering premises on a random basis and on-farm indicates that there is no widespread use of angel dust.</P>
      <P>In the campaign against illegal growth promoters our legislation now provides for the following measures: A total prohibition on the manufacture, importation, sale and possession of prohibited substances; a ban on the use of prohibited substances in farm animals and the sale or processing of meat derived from an animal so treated with prohibited substances; powers for authorised officers to stop any vehicle, enter any land or premises and search for, examine or test any animals, meat or meat product, or anything believed to be a prohibited substance; search warrants to be obtained by authorised officers, members of the Garda Síochána and officers of Customs and Excise to enter and search any land, premises or vehicle on reasonable grounds of suspicion; the locking up of herds and meat pending further investigation and surrender of identity cards; condemnation of the meat or meat products containing residues.</P>
      <P>To ensure observance of the regulations the Minister for Agriculture and Food has stringent enforcement measures in place.  Over 400 offices are authorised to enforce the regulations. Veterinary inspectors at slaughtering facilities are empowered on suspicion to detain and sample any animal or meat and if the use of illegal substances is confirmed to condemn such animals or meat.</P>
      <P>Under the EC random sampling programme samples from carcases are tested annually for beta-agonists in the Meat Control Laboratory at Abbotstown.  This programme commenced in 1990.  Samples tested to date were negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, is undertaking an <Col N="1673" /> intensive campaign at factory and farm level to deter and detect any abuses or would-be abuses of these substances.</P>
    <P>The State Laboratory is also involved in testing.  Methods have been developed for the analysis of substances, feed and samples from live animals for the presence of several beta-agonists.  Levels of below one part per billion can be detected.</P>
    <P>There is no cause for consumer concern and my Department and the health boards are keeping in close contact with the Department of Agriculture and Food at national and local levels.  At this stage, in view of this preventive action I do not propose to initiate further action through the health boards.</P>

      <P>The Government's strategy to control expenditure on prescribed drugs is a coordinated strategy which incorporates measures to control the price of drugs and measures, in co-operation with the medical profession, to ensure cost-effective and appropriate prescribing.</P>
      <P>With regard to price, the Deputy will be aware of the present agreement between the Government and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries which has resulted in a reduction of 10 per cent on average in the prices of drugs since the previous year.  The main features of the new agreement is the breaking of the specific link between Irish prices and UK prices.  In future price movements in Ireland will be linked to price movements in certain EC countries, rather than those in the United Kingdom alone, with a protection clause which prohibits the cost of any medicine in Ireland being higher than the UK price.</P>
      <P>In relation to the area of cost effective prescribing the Deputy will be aware that the recent review of the GMS reached agreement on the action necessary.  Their recommendations are being introduced on a phased basis.  A national drugs formulary and a repeat prescription facility in the GMS scheme have been introduced already.</P>

      <P>The pattern of spread of the virus in this country to date which is largely intravenous drug abuse related is similar to that in France, Italy and Spain.  By contrast, the main source of spread in the United Kingdom, Germany and Scandanavia is homosexual.  However, there is now evidence that in these countries intravenous drug misuse is gaining ground as a source of infection.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the trend in this country our AIDS strategy has focused, <i>inter alia,</i> on actions aimed at reducing the incidence of needle sharing, both in terms of health education programmes and in Outreach contact.  In addition a needle exchange programme has been successfully operated in the Dublin area where the main intravenous drug misuse problem exists.  The results of a recent study in Ireland are encouraging in terms of the success of our strategy in that there is evidence of a decline in needle sharing from 67 per cent of persons surveyed who admitted to having shared needles at some time to 16 per cent who were so doing on treatment contract.</P>

The source of the claim that Ireland has double the number of claims against doctors and double the level of individual awards as the United Kingdom would appear to be the Medical Defence Union, one of the two medical defence organisations which operate here.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there has been such a <Col N="1684" /> decline.  On the contrary, the Government's commitment to the health services is firmly underlined by the 1991 provision for the health services.  The gross non-capital provision for the health services in 1991 amounts to over £1.5 billion.</P>
      <P>The health service share of resources has increased each year since I came into office.  This year, over one-fifth of total Government expenditure on non-capital supply services is devoted to the health services.  In addition, the Government have made available an Exchequer capital provision of £32.330 million.  A further £9 million will be made available from non-Exchequer sources, bringing the total capital provision to over £41 million.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to health care is shown clearly in the provision of better facilities.  New or extended hospitals have been provided at Beaumont, the Mater and St. James's in Dublin and at Cavan, Mullingar, Sligo, Waterford and Wexford.</P>
      <P>A full accident and emergency service is now provided at six Dublin hospitals. Reducing waiting lists has also been successfully tackled.  Last year the waiting lists for hip replacements were reduced by 16 per cent, the waiting lists for cataracts were reduced by 12 per cent and the waiting lists for ENT (including tonsils and adenoids) were reduced by 9 per cent in 1990 and 12 per cent since July 1990.</P>
      <P>Particular emphasis has been given to community-based services for the elderly, the mentally-handicapped, the physically disabled and for children at risk.  In the last two years, £8 million extra was allocated to services for the elderly, £3 million extra was allocated to services for people with mental handicap.  The number of places at day centres and day hospitals has almost trebled since 1984 and places at hostels and in community residence have doubled.  Six million pounds extra has been provided to develop dental services and it is now proposed to appoint an orthodontist in each health board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, arising from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> a seven year investment <Col N="1685" /> programme will provide £100 million capital funds to develop community-based services and an increase of £90 million in day-to-day spending on these services.</P>
    <P>These are just some indications of the areas in which the Government have invested heavily and will continue to do so in the future.  Rather than there being a decline in health care services, their development has been put on a very sound footing.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the suggestion that there is a decline in the health care services, particularly in the Cavan-Monaghan area, is not borne out by the facts.</P>
    <P>In Counties Cavan and Monaghan hospital services have improved substantially since the new Cavan General Hospital opened in June 1989.  Four additional consultants were appointed. Admissions increased by 27 per cent from 1989 to 1990 and out-patient numbers increased by 38 per cent.  A new paediatric department also opened in April 1990 with two consultant paediatricians serving Counties Cavan and Monaghan. Building has recently commenced of a new out-patient extension at Monaghan General Hospital which will include consulting rooms, enhanced casualty facilities, new lift shaft and upgrading of the existing physiotherapy department and toilet accommodation.</P>
    <P>Services for the elderly continue to be improved through the provision of additional staffing and facilities.  Psychiatric services also continue to be developed.  A 25 bed acute psychiatric unit has been opened in the new Cavan General Hospital.  Community psychiatric services in the two counties are well developed with the provision of additional day hospital, day centre and hostel places.  Services for those with mental handicap continue to be improved.  Additional funding has also been provided to enhance the dental services in the area.</P>

There is fairly general agreement on the excellent quality of Irish nursing, and this is evidenced by the ready access offered to Irish nurses to employment abroad.</P>
      <P>While there is a trend internationally towards the placement of nurse training in a more academic setting, there would need to be a convincing case to justify such a change in the Irish context, given the degree of satisfaction with the existing training system.  The various options for nurse training are currently the subject of review by An Bord Altranais.  In any event, the establishment of any new department within a university is a matter for the individual college and the Minister for Education.</P>

      <Col N="1687" /> I should point out that these figures include both public and non-public patients treated in public hospitals.  Up to now, hospitals did not distinguish between public and non-public patients in maintaining waiting lists for ENT services and therefore it is not possible to give a breakdown as between the two categories. With the revised eligibility arrangements, hospitals will, in future, be required to maintain separate waiting lists for public and private patients.</P>
    <P>Waiting times vary considerably from centre to centre and depending on the priority accorded to an individual case. For these reasons, it is not possible to give a national average waiting time from ENT procedures.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists are a feature of health care systems throughout the world as the demands for health care will always exceed the capacity of the available resources to meet it.  I am, however, acutely aware of the problems which arose in relation to waiting lists for ear, nose and throat services and I took steps to deal with this situation.  I am pleased to inform the Deputies that, from the information available to my Department, the number of patients on the waiting list for ENT surgery has decreased by about 12 per cent since July 1990.</P>

      <P>The consistent policy of my Department over a long number of years has been that with the exception of guide dogs, no animals are permissible in catering premises.  This has been communicated <Col N="1688" /> clearly to the health boards for over the past 15 years and they in turn have informed the owners of cafes, hotels, shops, supermarkets and other catering establishments.  My Department are in frequent contact with the Irish Guide Dogs Association in an effort to ensure that the blind who must use guide dogs are not discommoded or embarrassed.</P>
      <P>In the case of national hygiene campaigns, the special position of the blind who depend on guide dogs has always been brought to the attention of those involved in the catering trade.</P>
      <P>The environmental health officers of the health boards who are responsible for the enforcement of the food hygiene regulations have always recognised the special position of the guide dogs for the blind and brought this to the attention of the owners of food premises.</P>
      <P>A further circular issued from my Department to the chief executive officers of the health boards last week reiterating the need to exempt bona fide guide dogs for the use of the blind from the food hygiene regulations.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for refund of VAT incurred on the purchase of sea rescue boats and related equipment, applicants must meet various conditions as laid down in the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 18) Order, 1985.  An essential requirement in this regard is that any rescue service wishing to apply for a VAT refund must, in the first instance, satisfy the National Safety Council in a number of respects as regards its organisation and functioning.  I understand that the Inchydoney Inshore Lifeboat Association failed to meet the National Safety Council's requirements in this regard and, consequently, a valid claim could not be submitted to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

Accordingly, my Department have issued it with a guide to the EC Anti-Dumping Regulation, together with a questionnaire produced by the EC Commission which is designed to facilitate the preparation of complaints against dumped imports.  Additionally, the company have been invited to contact the expert official in my Department so that whatever advice they require will be provided.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that, in all cases where Irish industry demonstrates, in the required way, that it is adversely affected by dumped imports, my Department vigorously pursue the matter at EC level, in an effort to secure adequate remedies. In this case, too, every assistance will be given to the industry, should it decide to lodge a formal complaint.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the growing demand for gas in areas not currently served by the grid and, as I have told the House in reply to previous questions, Bord Gáis Éireann are developing a programme to extend the grid to non-gas estates in the Dublin area and in other centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme will, of course, be very costly and will take a number of years to complete.  Extension to individual non-gas estates will naturally depend on the level of uptake in each case.  Bord Gáis Éireann have a statutory responsibility to earn a reasonable return on their capital investment and must, <Col N="1696" /> therefore, assess all extensions on a commercial basis.  Only those estates which are identified as viable will be connected.</P>
    <P>The board have recently undertaken a pilot project in two Dublin estates which have shown positive, but marginal, results and on the basis of this pilot project, and subject to take-up, the board are proposing to extend supply to an additional 8,000 homes in hitherto non-gas estates throughout the country in 1991.  Some 32 estates in the Dublin area, involving about 6,000 houses, will be approached.</P>
    <P>It would be my intention that all viable estates in the gas supply area would be connected within five years.</P>

      <P>Last year, I extended the free travel scheme to enable a companion to travel free of charge with a recipient of disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA) who was unable to travel alone. This year, I am going one step further by allowing DPMA recipients to retain their entitlement to free travel when they enter residential care and, thereby, avail of the &ldquo;companion&rdquo; pass.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned is not in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, it is not possible to grant a &ldquo;companion&rdquo; pass in her case.  The question of further extending the &ldquo;companion&rdquo; pass is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

The possibility of doing so when all driving licences on issue are of the new style which includes the holder's date of birth is something which can be considered.

While the arrangements for the holding of the competition for the filling of the posts are a matter for the commission, the provisions of Part IV of the Act relating to reorganisation of local government in County Dublin require that these appointments <Col N="1703" /> be made as soon as possible.  I understand, however, that having regard to the various procedures involved, the persons to be appointed are likely to be in place before the autumn.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for filling these posts were raised in the course of consultations and correspondence between my Department and trade unions and associations concerned.  These consultations related mainly to the provisions of the Act governing the tenure of office of managers.</P>
      <P>I received a separate request from Dublin County Council Senior Officers Association for a meeting to discuss the reorganisation arrangements in County Dublin.  Consultation at local level was suggested and I understand that such consultation is taking place.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to (1) the lack of dental services in Killarney town schools and (2) the fact that the Southern Health Board's dental programme in Killarney area is grossly inadequate; if he will outline his proposals to rectify the problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I understand from the Southern Health Board that the board is finalising plans to provide additional dental units in Killarney to cater for the Killarney schools. The priority of the board, with regard to national school children, is to ensure that first, third and sixth classes receive attention each year.  In the current year all children in sixth class in the Killarney schools will receive attention.  With the provision of additional facilities it is expected that the targets will be met in the academic year 1991-92.</P>
      <P>There are at present 37 adults on the waiting list for dental treatment in the Killarney area.  These will be dealt with by the board's own dental services and under arrangements made by the board with private practitioners.  As the Deputy will be aware a special allocation was again made available to health boards in 1991 to maintain improvements in adult dental services.</P>
      <P>I might mention that a special allocation is being provided by my Department to enable the health board to commence additional orthodontic treatments in 1991.  Also, a vacancy for a consultant orthodontist in the health board, with improved conditions and salary, was recently advertised by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on the 30 September of the previous year. This is in accordance with the agreement made between the Government and the INTO.  In the case of Carysfort national school, Blackrock, there were 297 pupils enrolled on the 30 September 1990, which warrants a staff of principal plus nine assistants for the 1991/92 school year. The school will also have the services of a full-time remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions that can be made to the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. An application has been received by my Department for the appointment of an additional assistant to the school in September 1991, on the basis that it is a developing school.  My Department are currently examining this application and will be in touch with the school authorities shortly.</P>

As I outlined in my reply to a parliamentary question on 20 March 1991, the Aer Rianta arrangements provide for comprehensive noise insulation levels, including provision for double glaxing and roof insulation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Eolas investigation is to make an assessment of both the Aer Rianta arrangements for insulation of the house affected and the concerns of the St. Margaret's Community Council to maintain their quality of life.</P>
