    <Title>Sugar Bill, 1990: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>When we returned to the House after the Christmas Recess the first item to be dealt with was the Sugar Bill.  That was the same day as the budget and I had an opportunity for about 20 minutes to put on record the Labour Party's opposition to this Bill and our intention to oppose it on Second Stage.  I think we could deduce from the speech here of my colleague Deputy Deasy that the Fine Gael Party were not going to oppose Second Stage of this Bill; therefore it appears to us on the figures in this House that it is quite likely that this Bill <Col N="1232" /> will pass that Stage.  Nevertheless I was trying to put on record why I thought this Bill should be opposed.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach before he went into Government in 1987 assured the then Assistant Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr Peter Cassells, that the semi-State bodies were safe in the hands of Fianna Fáil and there was no intention to privatise any of those bodies.  We know that the much criticised Thatcher Government of about the same time, on going into a general election listed all those areas in the public sector &mdash; water, gas, telecommunications and so on &mdash; they intended to privatise.  They went to the country and received a mandate to do so.  It is very strange that in January 1987 the Taoiseach could give representatives of the workers in all semi-State industries an assurance that their companies would remain within the public sector.</P>
      <P>The position of the Progressive Democrats was somewhat different in that they gave some indication that public enterprise would be attacked should they come into power.  At the last general election, whereas the Progressive Democrats had some, shall we say, arrangement with the Fine Gael Party, the Government that finally emerged was a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition.  Therefore, the question would have to be posed: was it the Progressive Democrat element of the Government that persuaded the Fianna Fáil Party to take on board the privatisation of various semi-State companies beginning with the Sugar Company, and going on to Irish Life.  Indeed, from remarks made it would appear that Telecom Éireann and even a slimmed down An Post could fall into this category.  We are aware that the chief executive of Bord na Móna has indicated that that company also could be privatised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my opinion that in the general elections of 1987 and 1989 the electorate were misled since the major Government party had given a clear signal that they did not intend to privatise any semi-State companies, maintaining that workers in those companies could be satisfied with <Col N="1233" /> the written assurances given to Congress to that effect.  As we are aware, policy has since changed.  Now everything within the public sector that can be moved, and some that cannot, is being examined in that light.</P>
    <P>I contend that this Government and the previous minority Fianna Fáil Government never received a mandate to do this; they never put it to the electorate as part of their policy.  In that they differ significantly from the stated position of the Conservative Government in England, who listed their proposals in that regard.  Yet our electorate have never given this or the previous Fianna Fáil minority Government any mandate to privatise any of these companies. Neither has there been a debate with the general public on this issue.  Certainly, the Government cannot contend that they have had this issue publicly debated in the run up to a general election seeking that mandate.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are concerned about what is being done, for several reasons.  In his introductory remarks the Minister said that he had had a study conducted into the affairs of Siúicre Éireann under three headings: first, the continuation of their present activities and structures, it remaining a private company.  The second proposal was that it be considered for total privatisation. The third option was partial privatisation and commercial development of the company while retaining a degree of State control over their sugar operations and quota.</P>
    <P>We know that the Sugar Company has a very valuable asset in the EC quota of 200,000 tonnes of sugar which has rendered it a very attractive company to private companies within and without this State who might be interested in its privatisation. There are those of us who think that one cannot have a little privatisation and that the guarantees enshrined in this Bill fall far short of what we and workers within the industry would regard as a safeguard for them.  We contend that State control over the company should have been retained at 51 per cent at least if the Government pursued this <Col N="1234" /> privatisation.  Our contention was that it should be retained under total State control.  Since it is obvious that this Bill will receive a Second Reading &mdash; and we will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage &mdash; at the very minimum we should demand that the company remain in State control to the extent of 51 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of course, the provisions of the Bill stipulate that the Minister will retain 45 per cent of the shares in the company with beet growers and workers being offered a share option of 5 per cent, the safeguard for the company being the golden share of the Minister.  I contend that the golden share does not constitute a safeguard at all.  I can see no difference between what the provisions of this Bill offer and those offered in the Bill, for example, to privatise Jaguar in Britain, when the golden share proved worthless when circumstances arose in which the State and Government there wished to get rid of their interests in that public company. Therefore, I contend that that golden share could be got rid of easily if circumstances demanded here.  It would be my hope that the Minister could give much more assurance about that golden share than workers and the public in Britain received when it was offered as a great safeguard for their interests in Jaguar and other companies.  This golden share will be seen for what it is, merely something to give the impression that the Sugar Company will remain a partially public one with a large private interest. It is also my belief that the private sector will have little interest in the company if they believe the State still retains the ability to take decisions over their heads. On the one hand the Minister has endeavoured to give the impression that by way of this Bill he is privatising the Sugar Company and, on the other, that the company is safe with the Government as long as this golden share maintains the balance between the private and public interests.</P>
    <P>Neither do I see any great enthusiasm on the part of beet growers that their position or future is secured.  They have written to us public representatives <Col N="1235" /> expressing their concerns about their future in the industry and about the quota.  If that quota were lost to the country obviously their future in a very valuable sector of the agricultural industry could be lost also.  Yet they have not been assured either by the provisions of this Bill or the Minister's remarks that their concerns are being met.  Therefore, the workers and growers will look with a great deal of suspicion at what is proposed under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The recent announcement concerning cutbacks in An Post would lead to considerable concern that workers' rights cannot be assured in any Bill coming before this House.  Whether it be a wholly public company or a private one, enshrining assurances in a Bill do not sufficiently guarantee either of the groups or interests I have mentioned.  I have grave concerns about the assurances the Minister has given, and in discussions with unions representing the workers, that their jobs will be secure in the future. I hope the amendment we will put down on Committee Stage will give greater assurances, if they can be given as a result of being accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The options offered in the Bill should be looked at, having regard to the options available in other companies such as An Post.  The Labour Party are disappointed that the joint venture option was not seriously considered by the group who examined this company.  FII, a company which was facing difficulties in the mid-eighties, survived because this option was considered and joint ventures were approved in that case.  The Minister should have seriously considered that option, especially as he has the example of the success in FII.  That option would have assured our EC quota of 200,000 tons. It would have met the needs of the growers and assured the jobs of the workers.</P>
    <P>When we last debated this Bill we said that the company as it stood had made very good profits over the last ten years, having been brought through a very difficult period due to the excellent leadership in the company provided by the <Col N="1236" /> chief executive of the company, their board and their worker directors.  The company was rationalised.  The branches in Tuam and in Thurles were closed. Great sacrifices were made by the people who work in the industry and by the people who supplied the two factories in order that the company should be able to rationalise.</P>
    <P>The remaining two configurations of the industry, seeing that success is measured by the profit and loss account, should continue as they are.  The company were expanding and increasing their profits.  Both the chief executive of the Sugar Company, Mr. Comerford and the chairman were strong in their demand that the company should be privatised because it would give them more latitude in the wider industrial world to attract more business.  I admire what these gentlemen and their boards have done in the past, but I disagree that a company making profits and expanding could not have had the same latitude in the public sector as in the private sector.  After all, one of the assurances given to the workers in Thurles was that the company could go out and bring industry to the town in order to make some reparation to the workers and the people for the loss of a large industry.</P>
    <P>We do not agree with the Government. We do not trust the Government's assurances. The Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, gave very clear assurances to the people of Thurles during the 1987 election in letters distributed to all the workers that the company in Thurles was safe as long as Fianna Fáil were returned, and certainly if he became Minister for Agriculture.  Why should we now accept the Minister's assurances and guarantees on this Bill?  We are very sceptical about the contents of the Bill and the assurances in the Minister's speech.  We are opposing this Bill because there is not any reference to workers' rights and because security of employment is not assured in the Bill.  The concerns of the growers are not covered in the Bill either.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was published the Minister has obviously talked to unions and to growers, but the Bill before us today <Col N="1237" /> does not have those assurances in it.  As long as that is the case we have to be sceptical.  For all the reasons I put forward today and on 31 January last, the Labour Party will not support this Bill on Second Stage and probably not on Committee Stage unless radical amendments are made to it.  Because of the genuine concerns of the people in the industry and those depending on it and of the agricultural community, the Labour Party will oppose the Bill.  If the Members on the other Opposition benches have decided to support this Bill, I hope they will have second thoughts and will join us in our opposition to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  noting that the Irish Sugar Company, as a result of good management and sacrifices made by the workforce, is now trading profitably and is not costing the taxpayers any money,</P>
      <P>(b)  believing that the company has tremendous potential for expansion and diversification and that it should be used as a basis on which to develop a comprehensive food processing industry,</P>
      <P>(c)  further believing that privatisation of all or part of the company is not in the public interest,</P>
      <P>therefore declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If ever there was a proposal to privatise a company which was unjustified, unwarranted and unnecessary then this Bill to sell off the Irish Sugar Company is surely it.  The Workers' Party will be fighting it every inch of the way.  The Minister in his budget speech stated that privatisation would serve to reduce substantially our actual borrowing and eventually our Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1991.  What we can deduce from that is <Col N="1238" /> that the proceeds from privatisation will be used to reduce borrowing and thus help ease the burden of the national debt and the debt servicing costs.  It was stated that it was hoped to realise between £50 million and £60 million.  If ever it could be stated that selling the family silver to pay the mortgage is bad policy, most certainly this applies now.</P>
    <P>Rather than developing this great resource to generate wealth and boost our economy, privatisation revenue will be used to effect an apparent but not real improvement in public finances. The attainment of a debt/GNP ratio of 100 per cent by 1993 has a lot to do with the privatisation of the Irish Sugar Company.  This company made a major contribution to regional development in employment creation and the purchase of profitable crops from farmers.  There were spin-off effects for hauliers, traders and others.  The contribution of the Irish Sugar Company to GNP is very substantial each year.  Employment, of course, is no longer a major objective of Government policy; the reduction of the national debt is their primary objective, and everything follows from that.  It is like the story of killing the goose that laid the golden egg.</P>
    <P>The recently published <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> refers to the Government's commitment to the maintenance of a viable and commercial semi-State sector; yet here is a company which is both viable and commercial and it is being gift wrapped and handed over to the private sector.  It is now clear that this Government have embarked on an extensive programme of privatisation. The legislation to facilitate the privatisation of Irish Life was passed last year and the Government have been desperately seeking a buyer for Irish Steel. Verolme Dockyard has been sold.  Other probable candidates for privatisation include B &amp; I, ICC and possibly ACC.  It is not a case of the Government simply deciding to rid themselves of a number of loss-making companies which are draining scarce Exchequer resources. The list includes large companies, small concerns, profitable and unprofitable <Col N="1239" /> operations.  The basis on which these decisions are being made is not commercial but clearly ideological.  Fianna Fáil have either abandoned the support they once held for the efficient and vigorous commercial semi-State sector or else the Progressive Democrats tail is wagging the Fianna Fáil dog.</P>
    <P>There is a number of myths about the respective performances of the public and private sectors.  There is the myth that all private companies are efficient and that all public concerns are inefficient, that all private companies are profitable and all public companies are loss makers.  There is the myth that private enterprise is innovative and adventurous, while public enterprise is conservative and over-cautious.  Many of these myths have been fostered by rightwing economists who have been provided with platforms by the privately-owned newspapers to wage ideological war against public enterprise in favour of private enterprise.  Some of the proprietors of the same newspapers would, of course, be only too delighted to get their hands on the cream of the semi-State sector.  There have, of course, been semi-State companies which have performed very poorly but there are also those who have performed excellently.</P>
    <P>In many cases semi-State companies were established originally either because of the collapse of private companies or because private enterprise was unwilling to provide badly needed public services. Seán Lemass said that State-financed industries had been set up only where considerations of national policy were involved or where projects were beyond the scope or unlikely to be undertaken by private enterprise.  The Irish Sugar Company was established in 1933 as a result of the failure of the privately-owned Irish manufacturing company which had been established in 1925.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind the House of the appalling record of Irish private enterprise and the necessity for the Oireachtas to intervene on three occasions during the past decade to rescue some of the biggest concerns in the country from the <Col N="1240" /> results of their own inefficiency.  There was, first, the PMPA, which collapsed in 1983, threatening the entire insurance industry.  Shortly afterwards the Dáil had to provide more than £100 million in public funds to save Allied Irish Banks from their mishandling of ICI, a disaster so great, we were told, that it threatened the entire banking system.  Only last summer the Dáil had to be recalled to rescue the golden boy of Irish private enterprise, Mr. Goodman &mdash; the man held up by the champions of private enterprise as an example to be followed by all &mdash; from the results of his own greed an recklessness.</P>
    <P>In November 1988 at Mr. Goodman's request I, with my party president and one other person, met him and his executive. Mr. Goodman's statement at that time was that he was interested in buying into the Irish Sugar Company.  He stated quite clearly that the Irish Sugar Company, because of its heavy borrowing could not survive and was not a viable industry, but he would make sure that the industry would survive.  He made no secret of the fact that he had strong support on the Government side and also from the main Opposition party.  What would have happened had things gone right for him in the beef industry and if the Bill to privatise the Irish Sugar Company had been introduced a little earlier?  I can imagine the mess we would now have in the sugar industry.</P>
    <P>Neither has Irish private enterprise delivered the jobs, despite extensive feather-bedding by the State amounting to more than £1,100 milion in tax reliefs each year and more than £370 million spent on industrial development through bodies like the IDA.  Unemployment remains the highest in the EC and looks like going up again, The jobs created in the past ten years have been largely through foreign investment in Ireland. Why do we assume that selling off the Irish Sugar Company to private interests will be in the public interest?</P>
    <P>In The Workers' Party discussion document <i>Making It Work/A Framework for Industrial Development</i>, published last May, we outlined our position on the role <Col N="1241" /> of State companies and of the private sector.  The Workers' Party, the document states, believe that a flexible approach should be adopted regarding the role of State enterprise in pursuing national industrial development.  It goes on to state that where State companies are best placed to exploit industrial development opportunities, then they should not be prevented from doing so for political or ideological reasons.  Similarly where private enterprise offers the best potential and is prepared to work within the scope of a national industrial plan, it should be given every assistance to get on with the job.  It is our strong belief that the Sugar Company is best placed to exploit industrial development opportunities in the sugar and food industries. There is nothing to suggest that privatising it will assist the industry in any way.  Indeed the record of the private sector in the food area has been appalling and the numbers employed in what should be our most important industry has declined steadily.  Since 1972 when we joined the EC the numbers at work in the food industry fell by 19 per cent from 43,700 to 35,000.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company has had its ups and downs since it was established and many of its problems had their origins in political decisions made by various Governments.  The brave attempt to diversify the food processing industry and marketing through the establishment of Erin Foods was undermined by Government decisions.  General Costello who had done so much to develop the company resigned in 1966, leaving the way open for Tony O'Reilly to be appointed general manager and use the position to finish off Erin Foods and launch his international business career.  When General Costello as chief executive of the Sugar Company in the early sixties established Erin Foods, the food processing industry, Government interference restricted the food products to 10 per cent of the home market.  Just imagine the products that we could produce on our own land, that we could manufacture in our factories. Government Departments said the company were restricted to 10 per cent of the <Col N="1242" /> home market and further interfered in the appointment of marketing managers so that the aggressive marketing policy which should have been taken up by Erin Foods at the time was never pursued.</P>
    <P>We come to the mid-sixties when in fact a decision was made to separate the food division from the Sugar Company, and this is at a time when in fact the Heinz company was appearing on the scene.  That disastrous decision which was taken by the then leader of the Government, Mr. Jack Lynch, and supported later by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Charles Haughey, in 1966-67, agreed to separate Erin Foods from the Sugar Company, link the food company to the giant Heinz company to be gobbled up. That is exacty what happened to our food industry.</P>
    <P>In 1966 General Costello, who had struggled for years to build up a powerful food producing and processing industry in Ireland based on co-operation between State enterprise and co-operative farming and joint agreements with the producers on the land, resigned and was replaced as general manager of the Sugar company-Erin Foods by Tony O'Reilly, a fanatical advocate of private enterprise. That is the sad story of the linking of what would and should have been a viable company, Erin Foods, which produced and manufactured what we could grow ourselves, to the Heinz company.  We know the result: Erin Foods in Mallow, Fastnet Foods, Carlow Foods are all gone.  We also know what happened to the Tuam Potato Processing Plant.</P>
    <P>Now we are asked to support the privatisation of the Sugar Company.  There is no way we will do that.  We will fight this every inch of the way.  I would like to state as well the attitude of workers and growers in this matter and I will come to that later on.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems in the past decade in the company were the result of Government decisions instructing them to keep viable factories open for social and political reasons.  The company had planned to close the Tuam plant in 1980 but the Government insisted that it be kept open until 1986 at a cost in current <Col N="1243" /> prices quantified by the company at £13.2 million.  This is the kind of political interference in the affairs of the company that has been going on.</P>
    <P>Against this background the recovery of the company in recent years has been remarkable.  From very substantial losses in the early eighties, as high as £22 million in 1982, the company made net profit of nearly £15 million in the year ended 1989. Indeed, the figures would have been even better had the company not decided to write off the £10 million it made from the sale of its head office against the cost of the Tuam closure.  Operating profits before depreciation and interest were £21 million, giving a return of around 22 per cent on capital employed; and borrowings which in 1982 were as high as £86 million were brought down to £22 million bringing with it a major decrease in interest charges.  The present chief executive of the company, Chris Comerford, managing director, is quoted as saying that rationalisation is largely behind this and that they can look now to expanding the group as a profitable commercial entity in the agri-business sector.  I wonder at what stage did he change his mind about the position of the Sugar Company, because he very definitely had proceeded to broaden the base of the company.</P>
    <P>The figures for the year ended September 1990, which had been published since the debate on this Bill started in the Dáil, showed an even healthier picture. In 1990 a report disclosed profits of £22 million, an increase of 30 per cent over the previous year.  Turnover jumped from £215 million to more than £271 million. That is the company that this Government, with the support of the Opposition, are proposing to hand over to private enterprise.  If anyone has reason to feel bitter about privatisation of the Sugar Company it must be the workers who were repeatedly called upon over the last decade to make sacrifices to help establish the company on a sound basis.  They agreed to a major redundancy programme, including the closure of Tuam and Thurles factories, but it seems that the reward for their co-operative <Col N="1244" /> approach is to be sold off to the highest bidder.  This very day I received from the workers in Mallow sugar factory a petition signed by them.  Yesterday when they knew this Bill was being debated here today they spontaneously initiated a petition which stated that &ldquo;the undersigned employees of the company in Mallow, noting that the company is trading profitably and as a result of sacrifices made by the workforce and good management, oppose the privatisation of the company&rdquo;.  At the same time the company was able to go in and give them details of privatisation of the shareholding, trying to hold a carrot out to the workforce.  However the workers know what they are about.  They know when there is security and when there is not, and they have very definitely appraised the situation.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that, once the company had been streamlined and started to make a profit, the Government decided to sell it off.  The company is expanding and I expressed my appreciation of and commended the chief executive officer for broadening the base of the company when I spoke earlier.  The company had bought one third of a share in James Budgett and Son, the second largest sugar wholesaler in the UK; it bought a controlling interest in the edible oils manufacturing company of James Daly, and acquired half of the shares in Odlums.  That is a progressive company, broadening its base into areas that are all linked in one way or another with the sugar industry.  There is plenty of scope for expansion and for further joint ventures along the lines of the Odlum linkup. The collapse of the Goodman Group would have provided the potential for expansion and development through the acquisition of the food industries.</P>
    <P>In 1982, it came to my notice as a Member of the Dáil that a very big French company known as Ferruggi had come to Little Island in County Cork to establish a sweetner manufacturing business, Fructose Corn Syrup.  I asked the then Minister for Agriculture, whom I knew was in charge of the Irish Sugar Company what he knew about it but he <Col N="1245" /> replied that he did not know anything about it.  I then discussed the matter with the chief executive of the Sugar Company. I also asked the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is now Minister for Finance, what he knew about this company and he knew nothing about it.  I asked them to meet to discuss the situation. In 1982, which is just a few years ago, a company was established in this country which was a real threat to the Irish sugar industry and the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce had no information on it. How interested are they now to appraise the situation and to secure the sugar industry in this country for the future?  I would ask the Minister to tell us what guarantees can be given, whether he will guarantee that the employment within the Sugar Company will be retained and increased and also the sugar quota of this country.  We have a sugar quota of 200,000 tonnes: 182,000 tonnes is A quota and the balance B quota.</P>
    <P>With this Bill all of this is being abandoned and the future of what should be the centrepiece of our food processing industry is being handed over to private enterprise.  When the Minister announced his decision last October he said that he would be retaining 45 per cent of the shares in the company, but there is nothing in this Bill to require him to do so.  The Bill clearly seems designed to facilitate the total sell-off of this important public asset.  Let us always bear in mind that a strong labour force, which presently exists in the sugar company, is part of industrial development.  You cannot have a manufacturing company without having a product.  The product of the Sugar Company is the sugar beet grown on our land.  We can cultivate our land and grow the beet on it.  There is no guarantee for the future of the sugar quota in the Bill.  Section 2 (2) refers to the Minister holding a &ldquo;special share&rdquo;, which he may claim is designed to prevent a total takeover by foreign interests, but section 2 (3) makes it clear that the Minister can dispose of this &ldquo;special share&rdquo; and other shares without any further reference to the Oireachtas.  If this Bill is <Col N="1246" /> passed there will be nothing that can be done to prevent control of the Sugar Company passing out of Irish hands.  In that situation what will happen, as I asked earlier, to our national sugar quota?</P>
    <P>I will deal with a few points that were raised in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions publication <i>Public Enterprise and Economic Development &mdash; A Policy Statement on Privatisation</i> issued in March 1990.  I wonder who convinced the leadership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to change their minds on the issue of privatisation?  The previous speaker referred to some points in the document that was issued and there were different options.  On the question of the &ldquo;golden share&rdquo;, this is what the Irish Congress of Trade Unions said at that time:</P>
    <P>The so-called &ldquo;golden share&rdquo; option is not a guarantee against foreign takeover as has been demonstrated by the Britoil and Jaguar experience in the UK.  At best, it enables a Government to respond to a situation as it sees fit. As happened in the UK, the Government decided not to exercise its right to block a takeover.</P>
    <P>Knowing of the strong private enterprise lobby in this country, the same thing could happen here.  Therefore, the &ldquo;golden share&rdquo; option is a very unreliable mechanism for protecting the public interest in these companies.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;golden share&rdquo; is also being examined by the European Commission and may be deemed to be contrary to EC competition law.  I will not say whether it is or not but I am reliably informed it is more likely to be deemed to be contrary to EC competition law.  This is a good reason the Government should withdraw this Bill and thus secure the Irish sugar industry in the interests of the State, of the growers and of the workers.  This is very shortsighted policy. Do they hope to say: &ldquo;we are great fellows, we are keeping the finances of the State in order&rdquo;?  But at what cost?</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company is not costing the taxpayer any money.  The Bill as drafted does not contain any provisions to protect <Col N="1247" /> the jobs or working conditions of workers, who have done so much to reestablish the company on a sound footing. Why is there nothing in the Bill to protect the interests of the workers?  I will remind the Minister, if it is necessary for me to do so, of statutory instrument S.I. No. 306 of 1980, which deals with European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Under-takings) Regulations, 1980.  If the Government are so concerned about the interests of workers, why have they already incorporated in the Bill the provisions to safeguard the interests of workers?</P>
    <P>As I said already the company are not costing the taxpayer any money and have the potential to pay a dividend to the Exchequer shortly.  Is that not the road we should be going down, because the company are now profitable and would pay a dividend to the Exchequer?  By doing so, the Minister would secure for all time the Irish sugar industry and also help to develop the food industry which is crying out for development.  It is a shame and a scandal that we are importing food which could be grown and processed here while at the same time we are exporting our young people.  Quite recently I read in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> an interview with a person who had come home from one of the cities in England and who told <i>The Cork Examiner</i> journalist that &ldquo;you would be ashamed of the number of our young people who are homeless and hungry in Britain&rdquo;.  This is happening while we are selling off an industry that could provide jobs in the future.</P>
    <P>The reasons for seeking to privatise the Irish Sugar Company are ideological and not commercial and the Minister should have the honesty to admit as much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing this important legislation before the House in such a short period of time.  I am satisfied that the Minister and the Government have taken the correct decision in their proposals to restructure the Sugar Company.  The <Col N="1248" /> legislation will have the effect of allowing the company to develop and expand while at the same time it will permit the Government to recoup some of the substantial moneys that have been invested in the company over the years.</P>
      <P>As a quoted company it will have access to substantial resources which will be of great assistance to the company in diversifying and expanding.  The sale of the shareholding of the Minister for Finance following flotation will ease the Exchequer borrowing and help to reduce the national debt.  The development of Irish agriculture and food is of central importance to the development of the Irish economy.  An intrinsic part of that development is the development of State manufacturing companies.</P>
      <P>The Sugar Company were set up under the provisions of the Sugar Manufacturing Act, 1933, with the main objective of manufacturing sugar from beet.  However, over the years the company have diversified into many new areas such as agriculture, heavy engineering, food processing, fertiliser distribution, molasses trading and many other areas.  Partial privatisation will further enhance the process of diversification which in turn will lead to greater profitability and subsequently greater job creation.</P>
      <P>The company were in a loss making situation in the early eighties but due to the commitment, loyalty and dedication of both the employees and the small farmers &mdash; the beet growers &mdash; we now have a very profitable and effective company. Turnover has reached over £270 million with an operating profit of over £18 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being from and representing the constituency of Wexford where over 1,000 farmers depend, for a portion of their income, on sugar beet, and an area which sells over a quarter of the raw material needed for the Sugar Company to prosper, I am obviously very concerned about the long term viability and future of this company.  I am satisfied that the legislation before this House will protect the future of both the employees and the <Col N="1249" /> farmers who depend on the Sugar Company for a living.  I am glad the Minister has recognised the very important role which both the employees and the farmers have played in the expansion of this company.  He has made provision for a shareholding for both the employees and the farmers that will further enhance this company and will ensure the continued loyalty and commitment of both the employees and the farmers to the development of the Irish Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the provision which allows the Minister for Agriculture and Food to acquire a special share in the holding company.  This will prevent the disposal of the controlling interest in Siúicre Éireann or the Sugar Company's assets.  I call on the Minister to ensure that under no circumstances can this share ever be sold.</P>
    <P>Particular attention must be paid to the 5,000 growers who are the cornerstone of the Irish Sugar Company.  It is vital that growers will be party to any future decisions regarding the redistribution of the Irish sugar quota.  The new company must recognise the rights of existing contract holders in traditional beet growing areas.  As a representative from the Wexford constituency I am particularly concerned about this aspect.  We, in Wexford, have been loyal to the Sugar Company.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that under the provisions of the new legislation these farmers will always have the right to maintain their traditional beet growing contracts.</P>
    <P>The new agreement must also ensure equal distribution of profits from higher sugar extraction.  I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to this matter. There is growing concern among the farming community that they are not getting their fair share of profits from the higher sugar extraction.  An agreement must be established detailing aspects of contract offers and acceptance, payment systems, management of sugar quota and sugar surplus.</P>
    <P>The company are succeeding in a very competitive business but in order to continue to succeed in this business they must <Col N="1250" /> have access to the capital markets to allow them to raise sufficient finance to permit them to diversify, to expand and to create further jobs resulting in greater profitability.</P>
    <P>The sale of the shareholding of the Minister for Finance following flotation will help to reduce our national debt and the interest repayments on that debt.  I mention this because of the very substantial burden this debt is placing on every individual and every family in the State.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to compliment the Minister and the Government on bringing forward this very positive legislation.  It will have a two-fold effect, that we will see continued expansion of the Sugar Company, greater diversification, greater profitability and, in the long term, greater job creation while on the other hand it will allow the State to repay part of the substantial money we owe arising out of our foreign debt.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo. Tuigim go bhfuil ag éirí go maith leis an gcomhlacht, go bhfuil brabús mór acu i mbliana ach go bhfuil airgead ag teastáil uathu.  Tá mé cinnte nach bhfuil an t-airgead ag an Rialtas agus, mar sin, tá súil agam go mbeidh rath ar an iarracht seo de bharr an Bhille.  Tá sé tábhachtach don chomhlacht, don tír agus do Cheatharlach go bhfaighfí an t-airgead agus go n-éireodh leis an scéim seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not in this wide world a valley so sweet as that vale down in Carlow which grows such fine beet.  That means I have a special interest in the Sugar Company representing as I do the sweetest county in Ireland, the county that in 1926 had the privilege of having the first sugar factory opened in modern times when Bishop Foley turned the sod under the watchful eye of Mr. Edward Duggan. Since then Carlow has gained much from the sugar industry.  It has been an excellent industry in the town and has attracted other industries.  It has been good for the farmers because, as we know, a number of crops and other farming enterprises <Col N="1251" /> have run into difficulties.  The beet industry appears to be the one industry that, despite the vagaries of the weather and problems that arise at different times, gives a reasonable return to the farmers. I am sure they are not happy that they are receiving sufficient profit and I will deal with that point later as Deputy Cullimore has done.  In general it is the one crop that has stood by this country and as a result it has been of tremendous help to the workers who in turn benefited from the production of beet.</P>
    <P>Employment has been a major factor but recently there has been a cutback.  In 1981 we had an employment figure of about 3,600 but that was reduced to almost 1,200 last year.  This has nothing to do with the privatisation of the company, I did not follow the logic of Deputy Sherlock's line of argument.  The present position is that the company has been streamlined and people have been made redundant.  Some people did not want to be made redundant, but many more were willing to step down because of their age. I feel sorry for the people who did not want to be made redundant.  This streamlining will mean that the company will be able to compete in competitive markets in the future.  The company have made large profits this year and I am sure they will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable the company to secure extra finance.  They will have to leave their core business of producing sugar and get involved in the agri-business. If they want to get involved in the agri-business they will need finance. As I said earlier, they cannot look to the Government to provide this money. Unfortunately, the Government do not have enough money to meet all the demands made on them.  I am sure that if we were in power we would have more money.  However, that is a different kettle of fish.</P>
    <P>Even though I welcome the Bill and have no hangups about privatisation, there are some aspects of it about which I am concerned.  The workers in the company and farmers have to be protected. I regret that the Minister has not included <Col N="1252" /> a provision in the Bill which will protect the workers.  I know he gave a commitment that he would introduce such an amendment on Committee Stage.  He said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>This will provide specifically that the rights which employees of Siúicre Éireann, or its subsidiaries, hold before the date on which the Minister for Finance transfers his shares in Siúicre Éireann to the new holding company will continue to be held by them on and from that transfer date. Provision will also be made to ensure that employees will not suffer any less favourable terms under their pension or superannuation schemes, after that transfer date.</P>
    <P>As a former colleague of the Minister's in college, I have no reason to doubt his word.  It is very important that he introduces such an amendment on Committee Stage and, if it is not introduced, all hell will break loose.  It is important that the workers who have made this company so successful do not suffer in their dealings with Greenvale, the new holding company.  I look forward to the introduction on Committee Stage of the amendment promised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>What will happen to the 1977 legislation, which provided for the appointment of worker-directors.  Will the worker-directors currently working in the Sugar Company be transferred to Greenvale? Will legislation be introduced to cover this issue?  I should like the Minister to say in his reply what the position will be in relation to worker-directors.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by previous speakers to our sugar quota.  Our quota of European beet production is 2 per cent.  This may not be regarded as a very large share in a European context, but we regard it as a major share.  We have to make sure that our share of this market is preserved.  We probably have no grounds for worrying about our quota in advance of the privatisation of Siúicre Éireann, but it has been said that the golden share which the Minister has to protect the company against take-overs by perhaps a foreign company may not <Col N="1253" /> stand up under EC legislation after 1992. Nobody seems to be an expert on this issue, but, as we have found out in the past, EC legislation can overrule our legislation.  I ask the Minister to say how he believes we would fare under such EC legislation.  It would be disastrous if EC legislation could overrule ours.</P>
    <P>The most important point is that the principle of quotas is preserved.  It might suit us to get away from quotas in many areas, but it is vital that our 2 per cent of the beet industry is preserved.  If the French can produce 30 per cent of the beet needed, the production of an extra 2 per cent would not pose any difficulties for them.  They would have no problems in their climatic conditions in producing the 2 per cent extra which we produce at present.  It is very important that our sugar quota is preserved.  I believe farmers would like to see joint ownership of our quotas so that they would be managed by farmers, the company and the Minister.  However, as we are given our quotas by Europe, it is difficult to know who has complete control over them. Nevertheless, our sugar quota is very important and it would be disastrous if anything happened to it.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to &ldquo;ghost sugar&rdquo;. Farmers have found that the sugar extracted from the crown of the beet, which up to now has been regarded as waste, accounts for almost 10 per cent of the sugar extracted.  Farmers have not been paid for this sugar over the years because it did not seem to matter. However, with the use of advanced technology they are able to get much more sugar from the beet than they did previously. Not alone are farmers not paid for this 10 per cent of sugar but they will have to pay for it if they go into the C quota later.  Farmers are not happy about this and I can understand why they may wake up at night after seeing &ldquo;ghost sugar&rdquo; chasing them.  The privatisation of the company may not be entirely to blame for this.  I will refer to this point again later.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure what Deputy Sherlock's philosophy is on privatisation, public companies and so on.  It is very <Col N="1254" /> important that companies are able to make a profit.  My colleague, Deputy Deasy, played a leading role in giving Siúicre Éireann money when they needed it.  I am sure he feels happy about this as the company is now a viable, profit-making one.</P>
    <P>The impression has been given that everything in the company will go wrong once it is privatised.  Things went wrong in the past &mdash; there were losses and many staff were made redundant.  When I hear reference being made to Seán Lemass, Pádraig Pearse or Wolfe Tone in the Dáil or anywhere else I get goosepimples. People always talk about what these people would do now.  We should let the dead generation rest in peace.  I am sure Seán Lemass, who was a marvellous man, would have different views in 1991 to those he had in 1931.  We always quote what people said but what I said last year may not be relevant to what I say this year.  So far as industry is concerned, I do not think reference should be made to what was said by Seán Lemass.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Sherlock rightly said, the Heinz effort proved to be disastrous for the food industry and a tragedy for Ireland.  We have tremendous scope for producing food in this country and the food industry should have been able to prosper.  I regret that that part of our food industry failed so abysmally.  Perhaps the privatisation of this company will enable them to move into other sectors of the agricultural industry.  I wish the company well and I should like to congratulate Mr. Chris Comerford and the chairman, Bernie Cahill, on their courage and enterprise. I hope they will be successful agus go mbeidh gach rath orthu sna blianta atá rompu.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important legislation as far as Irish agriculture, and particularly the Sugar Company, are concerned.  I want to congratulate the Minister and indeed the Minister of State for bringing forward the legislation at this time.  As we enter a new and exciting phase in European history it is important that our indigenous industry should be afforded every opportunity of being put on a proper sound financial footing in order to face the exciting prospects in the new Europe.</P>
      <P>In considering this Bill the House would do well to keep in mind a number of considerations of a general nature.  The first of these is the fact that the Sugar Company have been trading successfully for almost 60 years, with their four factories at Carlow, Tuam, Thurles and Mallow.  The company have a pivotal role in the Irish agriculture sector.  During this time they have demonstrated a capacity for innovation and adjustment in helping to change the face of rural Ireland, and that has contributed greatly to the establishment of long term confidence in the agriculture sector.</P>
      <P>A second consideration is that the Sugar Company down through the years have been a major employer.  Apart from those employed directly they have also provided employment in the cultivation and harvesting on the farm, and in the provision of fertilisers and seed.  In addition there is a major employment content in the road and rail haulage sectors involved in the transportation of sugar beet and in the processed sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third consideration is that over the years the number of occasions on which the Sugar Company returned a loss is few, in spite of having to trade in some very unfavourable economic conditions. In the past 15 years the company have embarked on a major capital investment programme.  This is very evident to anybody who has recently seen the major <Col N="1256" /> changes in Thurles and Carlow.  This programme was essential if the company were to keep pace with international competition in the sugar sector.  Successive Governments have contributed towards this major investment programme by making Exchequer advances to the company in order that their debt equity ratio would remain in line with commercial norms.  This investment was essential to ensure the survival of the sugar industry since the finance was required to replace obsolete machinery and to increase the production efficiency of the various factories.  This rationalisation programme also saw the closure of two factories in Thurles and Tuam. The programme of investment that has taken place in Mallow and Carlow will streamline their operation and hopefully will put them in a position where they can take advantage of the new Europe.</P>
    <P>This investment by the Exchequer in the sugar industry has raised the burden of interest charges which constituted a serious drain on the company's resources. Evidence of this turnabout can be seen from the fact that in 1980 losses in the Sugar Company amounted to £11.2 million while the corresponding figure in 1981 was £12 million whereas in the past few years there has been a return to substantial profit.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill constitutes a recognition by the Government of the central role played by the Sugar Company in the development of agriculture in Ireland over the past 60 years.  It places on record the commitment of this House to fostering an ordered future for the Sugar Company.  As regards farmers, they should be considered as partners in this whole new structure.  I would like to compliment the Minister for the manner in which he undertook negotiations with the farmers and indeed the employees of the Sugar Company prior to the publishing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government requested consultants to investigate the correct approach to privatisation or semi-privatisation and, as was correctly pointed out in the consultant's report, the company had to make major changes to <Col N="1257" /> ensure their long term commercial viability.  In this context I am glad to see that the company have diversified somewhat from their core operation, which is the production of sugar, by the acquisition of a 50 per cent share in Odlums Limited, and they have an option to purchase the remaining 50 per cent.  It is very positive thinking by the Sugar Company to diversify, and if they are to diversify further they must be given the opportunity to do so.  They have also involved themselves recently in commercial joint ventures with private companies and some of these are now up and running successfully in Thurles.</P>
    <P>Evidence of the breakdown of the company's activities can be found in the 1989 turnover of £216 million.  The sugar division accounted for £125 million or 58 per cent of total turnover.  The food division accounted for £34 million or 16 per cent of turnover and the agri-trading division accounted for £57 million or 26 per cent of turnover.  Employing over 1,750 people the Sugar Company are indeed a major player in the Irish agriculture industry.  These figurs will increase as the Sugar Company continue their policy of acquisitions.  I am glad to note that planning permission has been sought for the building of an advance factory in Tuam. This was one of the dark areas of the Sugar Company's business in the past number of years.  Tuam suffered as a result of rationalisation which took place in order to streamline the industry.</P>
    <P>Full credit should be given to the management of the Sugar Company for the turnaround in the company's fortunes in the past number of years.  Tough decisions had to be taken and the results of these decision can now be seen in the performance of the company in their new improved financial position.  It was indeed a team effort involving farmers, workers and the executive of the company who have succeeded in ensuring that this most important agri-industry is now in a healthy condition and is in a position to take advantage of the new opportunities which the new open Europe will offer them over the coming decades.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" /> The Irish Exchequer had a major part to play in the new improved fortunes of the Sugar Company.  The Exchequer has contributed over £59 million in equity since 1982 and the total Exchequer equity now in the company is £65.5 million. Successive Governments have played their part in ensuring the success of the Company.</P>
    <P>When this legislation is enacted, it will enable the State to get some return for its funding of the Sugar Company.  The aggressive attitude to production and marketing which has been so evident in the company over the past decade should instil confidence in the Stock Market, and I am happy that this approach will reflect itself in the price obtained when the new company go to the market.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the Minister and indeed of the Government for the delay in announcing this legislation. Market commentators have stated that had the company gone to the market last year the State, through the flotation, would have suceeded in gaining much more money.  However, there is no perfect time to go to the market; perhaps in a years time, commentators might say that this year would have been a better time than 1992.</P>
    <P>One should not underestimate the problems which lie ahead for the new streamlined operation.  The competition which the company will face from mainland Europe, particularly from the sugar industries in France and Italy, will be very severe.  These countries have the advantage of warmer soil temperature, they can get better sugar returns from their beet crops, and Ireland, its farmers and Irish Sugar must face up to these problems.  On the basis of the company's excellent performance in recent years I am confident that they can face this challenge head on and win.</P>
    <P>Because of their size, which is relatively small compared to the large companies on mainland Europe, the company must diversify and expand their base to survive and prosper.  Indeed, they should be encouraged to change because of the possible changes which may occur in the <Col N="1259" /> Community's sugar regime and the outcome of the GATT negotiations.  It is vital for the future of the company that they continue their diversification and that the growth and development of the company will be based on a carefully planned expansion which will incorporate their existing core business and also encompass areas of business which are complementary to their existing activities. Industries such as jam-making, confectionery and allied activities should be on the new company's shopping list for acquisition because they are large users of sugar.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Irish Sugar Company should not be constrained or hamstrung in a way which would inhibit their growth or expansion.  Opportunities are there at present &mdash; many more will emerge over the next four years &mdash; and it is important that the company should be in a position to avail of and explore these commercial opportunities.  It is not practicable for the company to be totally dependent on State equity for finance to avail of these takeovers and that is the purpose of this legislation.  The access to equity from the capital markets by way of a flotation on the Stock Exchange will ensure that the new company can exploit these opportunities when they become available.  The flotation, and the fact that they can avail of this source of funding, will be the life-blood of the new company. I am confident that investors will welcome the opportunity to become involved with the new company and will contribute to its success by investing in it when it is launched.</P>
    <P>The capital markets will prove to be a demanding taskmaster for the proposed new holding company, Greenvale plc., and they will demand high standards of performance from them.  The track record of Irish Sugar over the past number of years will stand to them, but it will not be sufficient to ensure that future equity injections, which may be called on, will be forthcoming.  Indeed, a continuous aggressive business performance is the only criteria which will be acceptable to these investors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> In regard to the participation of the workers in the new company and the background to the negotiations which took place prior to the publication of this Bill, I am glad to note that the Minister in his Second Stage speech said he would introduce on Committee Stage an amendment which will protect the rights of the workers in the area of pensions and superannuation.  I cannot understand why this was omitted from the original Bill, but we must take the Minister's word that he will introduce the amendment which will satisfy the workers that it will protect their rights.</P>
    <P>Farmers have a major part to play as the producers of the raw materials used in the manufacture of sugar.  The fact that they will be afforded an opportunity to invest in the new company shows a commitment, if a commitment was needed from the farming sector, to their interest in the new company.  Indeed, the workers will also be afforded an opportunity to invest in this new company; and it is important for the future of the company that a commitment in the form of shares by the producers and the employees should be in place.</P>
    <P>There has been widespread comment on the issue of the Minister's golden share option and alarm has been expressed, particularly in the farming sector, in relation to it.  From the point of view of the Minister &mdash; I must emphasise this &mdash; the farming community must be satisfied that the golden share option is everything which the Minister says it is.  There are reports that European courts might be in a position to overrule the meaning and the effect of this golden share option.  It is, as I understand it, a device to prevent the disposal of interests or assets in the Irish Sugar Company without the Minister's consent.  I would go a step further on this proposal and ask the Minister to ensure that not just with the Minister's consent could the disposal of shares and assets take place, but that they should not take place without the consent of this House.  It is not that I do not trust the Minister for Agriculture &mdash; I have the greatest trust in him &mdash; but at some future time an opportunity could develop <Col N="1261" /> whereby the interests of this major indigenous company could be put at risk. The safest way to deal with the matter is to ask the company to come back to this House to secure agreement for the disposal of major interests and assets in it.</P>
    <P>The question of sugar quotas was mentioned by the Minister and there is genuine concern that the Irish sugar quota is indeed a substantial asset, not just to the Irish Sugar Company, but to the nation.  Quotas, as we have become increasingly aware, are important cogs in the machinery of any agricultural economy. We have seen the effects of the milk quota and, indeed, sugar quotas are now like gold dust.  I notice a recent press report that sugar beet land is making £275 per acre in some parts of Cork, proof of the extent of the profitability of sugar production and beet growing.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.  I ask him to look at the area of the golden share option.  I am glad that he intends to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to protect workers' rights.  I hope this Bill will have a speedy passage through the House so that the company can build on the successes of recent years and go on to better things in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this Bill which provides the Irish Sugar Company with a sound financial structure, offering the company the means to plan a viable and successful future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tony O'Reilly, President of the H. J. Heinz organisation and a man who was at one time central to the operations of the Irish Sugar Company, once gave a very apt illustration of mixed emotions. He said that a person would have mixed emotions if he were to watch his mother-in-law driving over a cliff in his brand new car.  For me, as a representative of Fine Gael in the constituency of Tipperary north, the opportunity to speak on the Sugar Bill, 1990, is an opportunity to understand completely what is meant by mixed emotions in the context of the <Col N="1262" /> proposals now before the House.  Tipperary north is inextricably linked with Irish Sugar, and my mixed emotions are generated by the direction in which this Bill will lead us; about the impact which Irish Sugar have had on the people whom I represent.  These are the same people whose rights and aspirations are also served on the Government benches by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and who have paid a shattering price, in terms of jobs and security, by the actions of that Minister and the devastating impact he has had on the direction taken by the Sugar Company in recent years. This has been instrumental in bringing about traumatic changes in the lives of a great many people involved in, and affected by the working of this semi-State body who formed a central part of the life of the community in general.</P>
    <P>Tipperary is the home of General Michael J. Costello and of the late Maurice Sheehy, two of the major figures in the growth and the development of the Irish Sugar Company.  For more than 50 years it would have been impossible for anybody from Tipperary, and not just those involved in agriculture and tillage, to think of the Irish Sugar Company without thinking of the sugar factory in Thurles and the many people whose whole existence centred around the working of the factory and their annual beet campaign. Children were clothed and fed, houses built or bought and sons and daughters sent to college and into the world of industry and commerce all on the strength of having a father, mother, sister or brother bringing home a weekly cheque from the local sugar factory.  It was a way of life, an ethos where people were important and where the man on the weighbridge was held to be as valuable as the accountant in the office.</P>
    <P>People counted with M.J. Costello, and the affection in which he was held by the workers is a lasting testimony to the philosophy he developed and generated during his time in the industry.  A great many companies in Ireland today are managed and run by executives who learned their craft and developed their skills in the Irish Sugar Company.  This in <Col N="1263" /> itself says much about the outlook which was nurtured through successive generations in the company.</P>
    <P>I have referred to this aspect of the background to the Irish Sugar Company not out of any sense of nostalgia or to make any attempt to turn the clock back but rather to highlight once again that in our discussions about privatisation, financing, State equity and public share-holdings we should never lose sight of the fact that the bottom line should be people.  One of the great phenomena in modern Irish life is the credit union movement. It is no accident that the slogan of that very successful organisation is &ldquo;People, not Profit&rdquo;, a philosophy which is at the heart of the movement and which has enabled it to set the standards for all community orientated organisations.  It has been proved beyond any shadow of doubt that caring for people does not necessarily mean that financial success cannot be achieved.  On the contrary, it has been proved that the two can go hand in glove if the right approach is taken. However, there is a very thin line between the two and it is all too easy to overturn the philosophy and make it read &ldquo;Profits, not People&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that the recent references in the House to the Irish Sugar Company as being the jewel in the crown of semi-State bodies were not based solely on the fact that in recent times they have been returned to profitability.  We could, for instance, put that profitability in a very cruel context by saying that the number of people employed by Siúicre Éireann countrywide, at 1,700, is almost equal to the number of people on the live register for the Thurles area.  That is a sobering thought and it should not be cast aside lightly.</P>
    <P>For many years the Irish Sugar Company grappled with the problem of trying to marry the operation of a major industry with a high labour content with a commitment to maintain a high social profile with inadequate State funding. However, thanks to the nucleus of an excellent corps of executives and workers, the company survived; but on <Col N="1264" /> many occasions they came close to an emergency.  There is no doubt that there was a need for reform, but the path towards reform was the bone of contention. Putting the gun to the heads of many semi-State bodies who found themselves in this position was the answer provided by Deputy Brian Lenihan when he was the Minister responsible.  The stark choice which faced the Sugar Company was profit or closure.  The board and management of the company have now carried out the mandate given to them by that Fianna Fáil administration.  In fulfilling the instructions of their political masters, however, it was ironic that Chris Comerford and his management team were ridiculed and mauled, both publicly and privately, by Fianna Fáil politicians and activists throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>The question which must be asked is if the price has been too high and is profitability to be the sole criterion in all future activities of this or any other semi-State organisation.  Are job numbers in the Irish Sugar Company to be measured only in terms of acquisition, or will there be real jobs created?  The people of Tipperary have no doubt that the price has been too high.  The closure of the sugar factory in Thurles might well have been bearable had it been just a one-off incident and an isolated trauma in a sea of industrial harmony and smooth sailing, but it was not; it was the final straw which brought an over-burdened town to its knees.  The latest decision was based on woolly thinking on the part of a Minister and Government who do not know what they want or how to go about getting it.</P>
    <P>If people require evidence of lack of forward planning all they need do is look at the burgeoning Irish mushroom industry and the manner in which it has grown in recent times.  It should not be forgotten that there was the basis of a splendid mushroom industry in Thurles in the not too distant past.  This facility had its own compositing shed, heated growing houses and a fine canning plant, which was staffed by people who had a high level of technical expertise garnered from the food processing sector of the Irish Sugar <Col N="1265" /> Company.  The product was right, the facilities excellent and the workers committed; but the mushroom plant in Thurles is now but a distant memory in the list of industrial accidents which have beset the area.  Yet the Government are today spending millions of pounds by way of grants to aid the mushroom industry.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company in Thurles also had a machinery section which set new standards of engineering excellence and which gained a reputation second to none at home and abroad for the quality of their work; but they too have been consigned to the industrial museum and the skills and flair of the workers are no longer collectively available to the local community.</P>
    <P>The story of the mushroom plant and the machinery division could be repeated in many branches of the Sugar Company around the country.  The food processing section, for example, once encompassed seven factories scattered over the four provinces and involving a broad range of agri-based activities.  There is now but one factory, the Erin Foods plant in Thurles, which is a major employer in the area and which has survived in its present healthy state despite many threats in the past.</P>
    <P>It may well be asked what has this to do with a proposal to partially privatise the Irish Sugar Company.  It has got to do with learning from our past experiences, looking at our past mistakes, deciding how they were caused and resolving never to repeat them.  The many earth-quakes which have rattled the foundations of this great company and the failure of successive administrations to react positively to the problems which beset it during the years give us cause for concern that perhaps the lessons have not been learned.  For example, I am very sceptical about some of the remarks made by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, in moving the Second Stage of the Bill on 30 January last.  The Minister talks of seeking planning permission for an IDA advance factory in Tuam which will bring a new industry to the area.  I quote the Minister from column 798, volume 404 of the <Col N="1266" /> Official Report of 30 January 1991: &ldquo;The Sugar Company will contribute to the cost of this factory, in the context of their commitment to the establishment of new industries in the area following the closure of the sugar factory there&rdquo;.  There is not enough salt in the entire town of Tuam to help us swallow that one, over five years after the factory closed and without a single job being created in the intervening period.  The Minister, more than most, knows that advance factories are nothing more and nothing less than just factories, fresh and inviting maybe, but empty nonetheless and no guarantors of jobs in the long run, as the many vacant plants around the country will testify.</P>
    <P>This statement of the Minister has a particularly hollow ring, coming as it does from one who sanctioned the closure of the sugar factory in his own constituency of Tipperary North and who, with Shannon Development and the Sugar Company, almost managed to convince the people of the area that the closure of the factory would be in their best interests. The Minister's and the company's failure, after more than five years, to deliver on their promises to the people of Tuam and its hinterland, holds out very poor hope for the people of Thurles where the dole queue remains constant, despite claims to the contrary, and where emigration of our young people is all that prevents the same dole queue from reaching catastrophic proportions.</P>
    <P>That is one side of the mixed emotions about which I spoke earlier.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill, providing as it does the platform on which the Sugar Company may build a sound and viable economic future which will encompass all of the old values and ethics which have stood them in good stead since their foundation all those years ago.  The company have a sound base from which to expand their business, with a broad network of farmer suppliers, research facilities and contacts internationally.  The flotation of portion of the company's shares on the stock market will give them a financial muscle which they have lacked for too long and enable them to diversify from their core business, as they need to <Col N="1267" /> do in order to develop along the lines desired by their executive and their workforce.</P>
    <P>That expansion and development must, of course, take place in tandem with the protection of existing jobs.  The company cannot lose sight of their commitment to their present food division, already under threat by the recent problems with the Heinz organisation.  It is now an established fact that the HeinzErin agreement on sale and marketing of Heinz products in Ireland will alter radically in 1992, at which point Erin Foods in Thurles will become purely a distributor of Heinz products, thereby suffering a 50 per cent drop in revenue, which must have a very grave impact on the overheads of the operation with consequent serious effects on jobs within the Thurles plant.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that it is not enough for the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, to offer pious platitudes about hopes and aspirations for &ldquo;yielding a reasonable return to the Exchequer and ensuring as far as possible the future viability of the company&rdquo; unless, first and foremost, the workers of the company are given a solid commitment on job security.  I make this point in relation to the direction which the company are taking on the grassland project and in their acquisition of Odlum's, events which indicate a dilution of their commitment to Erin Foods and to the job security of the workers therein.</P>
    <P>The advantages for the development of Erin Foods in Thurles are crying out to be recognised, they are a skilled and loyal workforce and a prime location with first-class access to road and rail, situated in the heartland of a prime agricultural area.  The company have a responsibility to the town of Thurles, as indeed has the Minister, and the new found status which this Bill will confer on them both, by virtue of the financial strength to be gained from the investment of shareholders' capital, will give them the giltedged opportunity to discharge that responsibility to the town and the people of Thurles, while underpinning the role which Erin Foods can play in the future <Col N="1268" /> health and welfare of the company as a whole.</P>
    <P>Let the company work on their strengths, their experience in agricultural production and the skill, expertise and loyalty of their workforce.  Too often in the past the company, through the ineptitude of Government, were forced to dig up the foundations of the structure, when all that was really needed was some well-thought-out renovation work.  The road down which the company now propose to travel is well signposted by the failures of the past and by the warning signs which spring up from time to time, and these should not be ignored.  It may well behave the company to look beyond the national boundaries for their future direction but they should not forget where their roots are.  Thurles and Tipperary North are an example of the devastation that can be caused by the loss of a major employer. It is imperative that this should never be repeated.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill from another viewpoint also, that it is another admission by the Fianna Fáil administration, unexpected maybe, but very real all the same, that there are good ideas on the other side of the House and that they are not ashamed to take them and claim them for their own.  The notion of privatisation for the Sugar Company came from within the Fine Gael Party, based on the recognition by our members of the shackles imposed on the company by existing legislation and by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers.  I am glad that the executive, admirably led by Chris Comerford, and the staff of the company now seem to be steering their ship into relatively calm waters, and I urge them to continue forging ahead but to jealously guard the most precious possession they have, the many dedicated people who make up their workforce.  These workers have suffered more than their fair share of trauma in the past and may do so again in the future but they should be given cast iron assurances that their value and worth are recognised and appreciated.  Maybe the slogan &ldquo;People, not Profit&rdquo; is too idealistic, but is there not a grain of truth <Col N="1269" /> there to form at least part of the future philosophy?</P>
    <P>I wish Siúicre Éireann plc., and their proposed new holding company, Greenvale plc., the very best for the future, and I look forward to assisting and encouraging the company in channelling and directing some of their new found resources to provide viable and sustainable job opportunities for Thurles and Tipperary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I would like to make a brief contribution to the debate on this Bill before us here today.  The Irish Sugar Company over the years have had reasonable success, and different Governments have played a major role in ensuring their continued success and protecting the farmers and workers up and down the country.</P>
      <P>The company's main activity is the processing and distribution of sugar.  They have almost 100 per cent of the market for sugar in the State, 70 per cent in Northern Ireland and a small market in Great Britain from where a better market might obtain a bigger share.  The number of workers in the company has reduced substantially over a number of years and I suppose the closure of the Thurles and Tuam factories has been one of the main factors in that.  In the year to 30 September 1990 the company employed approximately 1,800 people and the previous year they employed about 1,500 or 1,560.  The Minister told us that this was the first time in a number of years that the workforce had increased.  It is good to see such an increase, but there should be potential within the company to create a substantial number of jobs in the next few years.  Probably at the moment the company's base is too narrow and they must diversify into other areas.  I know they are involved in Odlums, in grassland and in a few other areas, but surely a company such as the Sugar Company must have their brief to consider other areas of food-related industries both at home and abroad, to expand and develop and to create the jobs so necessary in this country at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> With proper development and marketing strategies I believe it will be possible to do so.  I contend there should be greater liaison between the Department of Agriculture and Food, particularly the horticulture section within that department under the guidance if the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Kirk and the new holding company.  I know that Deputy Deasy referred to this in his contribution, contending that there should be more involvement or liaison between the Sugar Company and the Department with a view to developing our food-related industries, particularly our horticultural and agricultural produce. Looking at vegetable growing in particular, it would appear that we can provide vegetables for part of the year but not all year around.  Successive Governments and Ministers have endeavoured to achieve this year round production but have not been successful in that goal.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we cannot produce vegetables all year around.  We have a very clean environment.  We hear much talk nowadays about the green industry in which we should be in a position to capitalise with our clean, pollution-free environment, the clean air we enjoy here.  We should be able to develop our vegetable industry, by organic or other means, so that we can guarantee year-round supply and, more importantly, be able to export, tapping the market provided by the 320 million people within the EC where there are tremendous marketing opportunities.</P>
    <P>There has been recent talk that the Sugar Company may become involved with the Minch Norton malting company located in Wexford, Kildare and other areas, because malting barley has tremendous potential.  If the Sugar Company decide to become involved with them I am sure that could be a successful enterprise.  We must remember that there are now new types of beers and beer industries developing within the EC. Malting barley remains underdeveloped and has great potential which should be exploited to the full.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us must be examined carefully.  The Minister must spell out its implications in three areas of the sugar <Col N="1271" /> beet industry.  The first is the quota, the second the implications for Sugar Company and other workers and, lastly, farmers and producers.  It is most important that under the provisions of this Bill workers retain their present working conditions and the pay, pension and superannuation rights enjoyed within the Sugar Company.  In the past too often when private enterprise becomes involved the first outcome was rationalisation, in turn inevitably leading to substantial job losses.  Usually management, the top brass, remained in place while workers were moved out and placed on the dole queues.  It would be my hope that the Minister will assure the House that this will not be the case when the new holding company is established, because Sugar Company workers have played a major part in building up the company to its present profitable position.  Any new legislation or partial privatisation proposal must ensure that workers' rights are protected.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to examine the possibility of worker/directors being involved in the new holding company. At present there are four worker/directors on the board of the Sugar Company.  It would appear that there will not be worker/directors on the board of the new holding company.  That is totally unacceptable.  The only way in which workers' rights can be protected is by having worker/directors on the board, sitting around the board table involved in decision-making in the future of the new holding company.  Therefore, the Minister should consider tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to allow for the involvement of such worker/directors in the day-to-day operations of the new Greenvale holding company.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to introduce a Bill and point out all of its advantages.  In his introductory remarks the Minister referred to the consultants' report and the advice he had received from them.  I have always been of the view that consultants will provide the type of report <Col N="1272" /> one seeks and that, too often such consultants differ and the relevant businesses go to the wall.  I do not place great value on the type of advice they might furnish. It would be my hope that the provisions of this Bill will protect the sugar quota and the interests of workers and farmers.</P>
    <P>This nation and the Sugar Company owe farmers, large and small, throughout this nation a great debt of gratitude.  They continued to grow beet throughout even the lean years when their profits were small.  They continued to fill the quota and suffered much hardship.  As we are all aware, beet is a winter crop which will be affected by bad weather.  We must also remember that we did not always have mechanical harvesters, thinners and other modern equipment and conveniences now available.  For example, in the sixties and early seventies farmers had to harvest the beet, crown it throughout the winter, harvesting it with horse and cart, tractor and trailer and the other equipment that made for a lot of hardship. Yet farmers continued to deliver the beet so necessary to the Sugar Company, thereby protecting the sugar industry and its workers.  Indeed, in many instances farmers received very little gratitude.  We cannot lose sight of that debt we owe them for their dedication and commitment to the industry.</P>
    <P>In this change over to partial privatisation of the Sugar Company it would be my hope that we will not see some individuals or companies making huge profits at the expense of farmers.  I contend that any future profits must be divided fairly between farmers and the workers involved in the company &mdash; there cannot be massive profits hived off to a percentage of private interests.  The whole issue of profits must be decided equitably with everybody receiving their fair share.  We must remember always that the sugar beet industry is of major importance to our farmers, those in my county in particular.  Farmers have expressed concern to me about the provisions of this Bill, being fearful how they will fare when it has been passed and resulting in partial privatisation.</P>
    <P>I might point out just how important is <Col N="1273" /> this industry to my county of Wexford where there are 1,400 beet growers, 2,000 people directly or indirectly involved in the sugar beet industry, growers, contractors involved in the sowing of the beet, spraying, harvesting and so on. There is also the involvement of CIE workers who haul the beet to Mallow and hauliers involved in the drawing of the beet to the Carlow Sugar Company. There is a modern up-market depot in Wellington Bridge in south Wexford under the control of an efficient manager, Mr. Séamus Kelly.  This depot is well run, efficient, located adjacent to the railway line allowing beet from south Wexford to be transported by rail from Wellington Bridge depot to the Mallow factory.  This industry is very important to County Wexford.  Neither it nor the farmers growing beet should be affected in any way.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that the industry in County Wexford will not be harmed.  I fear that the new partially privatised company will no longer provide a service to growers but will enter into the financial arena of profit making and people with perhaps no interest in the sugar industry will only be trying to ensure that the company make profit.  That will have a serious effect on the future of the sugar industry and the farmers and workers involved.</P>
    <P>I am baffled by how the Sugar Company operate their contract system.  New contracts do not seem to be available. Young farmers are very much constrained by the quota system.  I appreciate that there are limited quotas in the beet industry but a percentage of the quota should be made available to young farmers who want to diversify and get into the beet industry.  Young farmers are being discriminated against in this area and I would ask if this is the right attitude to adopt.  The Minister should ensure that a percentage of total contracts is made available to young farmers.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that in future the system of issuing contracts may change. Mallow is a long way from Wexford, and Carlow is 35 or 36 miles away, and while there may not be an official policy, I understand that the management of the <Col N="1274" /> Sugar Company seek to have the bulk of contracts within a 15 to 20 mile radius of the two factories operating in Mallow and Carlow.  This policy would be disastrous for farmers in County Wexford and for farmers in counties far removed from the factories.  The Minister when replying should guarantee that this type of selectivity of growers will not be contemplated, now or in the future because it would put a number of farmers out of business.  We have heard a lot about protecting the family farm.  Beet growing is one area where family farms are making a decent living.  Any decisions at management level which would mean the withdrawal of contracts around the country would be disastrous for farmers. I would ask the Minister to look seriously at this.</P>
    <P>We must retain the 200,000 tonne sugar quota.  It is a prime asset.  This is of such importance that it is written into the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and should be written into the Bill.  It should also be written into the Bill that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is the Minister responsible.  The Minister for Finance has a say, and everyone seems to have a say but the Minister for Agriculture and Food should be responsible.  I appreciate that the Minister is a responsible man but he may not always be Minister for Agriculture and Food.  It is important that it be written into the legislation that no change in the sugar quota can take place without the authority of this House.  It should not be up to any individual Minister or the Cabinet without the approval of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The workers have expressed concern about pension rights and superannuation rights.  I am glad the Minister has decided to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure that workers' rights are protected.</P>
    <P>Farmers are concerned about the golden share option.  Farmers supply the beet to the Sugar Company and they stood by the company through thick and thin.  Their fears should be allayed.  The safest way to protect the golden share option is to put it in the Bill that nothing <Col N="1275" /> can change or be redirected without the approval of the House.</P>
    <P>I could speak at length on the Sugar Company but I note that a number of other speakers are waiting.  While the Minister is moving in the right direction, I am somewhat concerned about partial privatisation and particularly about how the workers and farmers will be protected in the future.  It is important that the people who have devoted so much of their energy to building up the company are not sold down the river and that the company are not allowed to cream off the profits, to sell off some of the Sugar Company or some of the quota, a policy which would have a disastrous effect on our economy in the long term.</P>
    <P>What will happen to the money which will accrue from this part-privatisation of the company?  We have heard talk about reducing the national debt with it.  I am not so sure about this.  While I appreciate that we have to reduce the national debt, reducing the national debt means nothing to the people out on the streets who are unemployed.  Some of the money should be reinvested in the food industry, in developing new types of products whether by the Sugar Company or some other company.  There are unemployment problems over and above the national average in parts of County Wexford and in the south-east.  The Ministers for Finance and for Agriculture and the Government should seek to re-direct some of the money they will get from the partial privatisation of the company and direct it towards developing some of the natural resources in those counties which could create badly needed jobs.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with this new Bill and I hope he will take on board some of the points that have been raised by various speakers.  At the end of the day the quota, the workers and the producing farmers should not be sold down the river in any new deals.  They should be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with almost everything the previous speaker said.  He is a Deputy who understands the sugar <Col N="1276" /> industry and the commitment of growers and workers to the development of that industry.  It is particularly strong in the south-east.  The Deputy is naive if he thinks that the things he asked to be protected will be protected in a privatisation Bill.  The only way we can protect the jobs, conditions, pensions etc. of workers, the interests of growers, the retention of quotas and the retention of the sugar beet growing industry is by retaining this company as an efficient semi-State body which will look after these interests.  Once it is privatised, free enterprise will have a free hand.  They can grow or import sugar beet.  They can let workers go, downgrade workers, get rid of their jobs, take on part-time or contract workers and shut down factories. That is what free enterprise is about.  Surely the Deputy knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not a lot more to say other than the basic points I have just made.  It is interesting, however, to recall briefly the history of the Irish Sugar Company.  A private enterprise company was set up with the assistance of the Government in 1926.  They wanted to have a sugar beet industry here, so a company was established with a considerable subsidy.  The subsidy was as great as the amount of money the company paid to farmers to grow the beet.  By 1932 that company was struggling to the extent that they were producing 13,000 tonnes of sugar while we were importing 85,000 tonnes from Tate and Lyle, who had the market here at the time.  The company was such a flop that the new Fianna Fáil Government in 1933 took it over and established a semi-State company, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, the Irish Sugar Company. They had a fabulous first year when they enjoyed total support from the farmers and from the country, the Government and the people.  Within the first year three factories were established and the company had more growers than they could cope with.  They went from success to success.  Seán Lemass, who was involved in the establishment of the company, said that it would not be a commercially viable firm and would need <Col N="1277" /> State assistance, but it would be of enormous benefit to farmers and of enormous value to the country as a whole.  The Sugar Company has shown tremendous enterprise to the present day.  They realised that farmers did not have fertilisers and lime, so the company provided them.  Whatever they needed they supplied.  They gave farmers contracts annually and told them well in advance how much they would get for their sugar beet.  They trained them in all aspects of growing sugar beet and gave every assistance possible.  They also developed methods of harvesting the sugar beet which were well in advance of those in any other country.  A company was established to manufacture sugar beet harvesters which were exported to Britain and across Europe.</P>
    <P>The list of enterprises and activities in which the Sugar Company were involved is almost endless.  They were involved in golden syrup, molasses, dried molasses pulp, grassmeal, dairy nuts, horse conditioner, sugar beet seed, beet harvesters, the multi-row hoe, limestone spreaders, compound fertilisers, ground limestone, factory lime, and pre-cast concrete units for farm buildings.  They were involved in every area where they could assist farmers in the development of agriculture. They were the engine of growth in the fifties and sixties.  They gave stability and permanence to many thousands of farmers in the south-east, Munster and the west.  Without the Sugar Company farming in Ireland would have been even more disastrous than it was in the forties, fifties and sixties.  The Sugar Company had the confidence of the farmers and the people generally and as the main engine of growth for farming they showed enterprise, energy and the only innovative ideas which were emerging.  There never were innovative ideas coming from the Department of Agriculture, as there are not to this day.  Innovative ideas would be the last thing ever to enter their heads. The Irish Sugar Company certainly showed enterprise, growth and diversification.</P>
    <P>It was this need for further diversification in the farming area which led <Col N="1278" /> the general manager of the Sugar Company, General Michael Joe Costello, to move into the vegetable processing area, which had tremendous potential and possibilities.  What had been done for sugar beet growers could be done for vegetable growers by developing the same system, showing them a whole new range of vegetables and assisting them to grow them.  The vision was that a processing plant would be established in almost every county.  These processing plants were developed, utilising a very advanced processing system, namely, the freeze dried system, which was well ahead of anything that Heinz had.  Heinz were on a downward trend, losing out worldwide, not just in Britain and Europe but even in America.  They were a backward company with backward ideas.</P>
    <P>The development of vegetable processing had quite a dramatic effect in certain areas from Skibbereen to Glencolumbcille. Everybody recalls Glencolumbcille for a series of reasons.  One of the main generators of the new image, enterprise and push in Glencolumbcille at that time was the establishment of a processing plant for vegetables.  Farmers in that area, no matter how small their holding, could contribute.  One could be a grower and have a contract for an acre or ten acres or 100 acres of the vegetables of one's choice that one felt one, could grow and that one knew something about.  The processing plant in Glencolumbcille was of major significance in developing the ideas of the people and in bringing jobs and growth and enterprise into the area.  Fr. McDyer was very closely associated with the commencement of that and assisted in the development of other co-operative ideas in the whole Glencolumbcille Peninsula at that time.  Many people here probably do not even know what happened in Glencolumbcille, but I can tell the House that in the sixties this was something.  It gave a lift to everybody in the west and all over Ireland to see what could be done.  There were new ideas and hopes straight away.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Sugar Company, we are responsible for that and for setting up <Col N="1279" /> a separate company, called Erin Foods, associated with the Sugar Company in the vegetable processing area.  The Fianna Fáil Government had this tremendous tradition from 1932 of developing semi-State enterprises and pushing new ideas through the Sugar Company and Bord na Móna and various other ideas which were of dramatic effect all over rural Ireland.  In the sixties that same Fianna Fáil Party under Jack Lynch did not have the same vision of the potential for growth or development, of new ideas or diversification, of what to do with our farming, of how to use our resources to create new jobs and new ideas that would be economically feasible.</P>
    <P>Here was an area that one would have thought the Government would have regarded as being exactly what they wanted, something that would bring back our emigrants who had flown out in the thirties, forties and fifties.  This was a new idea, an indigenous development.  Let us bring in the multinationals.  There is nothing wrong with that so long as they are the icing on the cake and we are developing our own industries as well. However, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch and the present Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, who was Minister for Agriculture at the time, though they may have parted company, worked closely together and their decision was to prevent this little baby from getting off the ground and to protect our current private enterprise companies, companies like Batchelors and Goodalls who were here since before the State was founded.  I do not know whether they were getting anything from Batchelors or Goodalls at the time. The crazy ridiculous decision they made killed off the company before it got off the ground, because they decided to allow them to go ahead with Erin Foods but to sell only 10 per cent of their product on the home market and export 90 per cent.  Imagine any budding newborn industry being told that they must export 90 per cent of their product when they are only trying to get off the ground here in their own country.  That was killing it off before it got started.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> Nevertheless, the Sugar Company went ahead with their enterprise, sold their 10 per cent and pushed as hard as they could into Northern Ireland and Britain to try to sell the balance of their product.  Naturally, it took a few years to establish their market.  In their third year in the market they had increased their exports by 300 per cent when, for various reasons which are recorded in this book <i>Farming and the Food Industry</i>, which was developed by one of the departments of economic affairs and The Workers' Party back in 1986 or 1987, the process by which General Costello was forced to resign and Tony O'Reilly was brought in as general manager of the Irish Sugar Company in 1966 was begun.  That was just about three or four years after Erin Foods had been started and was being developed.  Just when it was beginning to really get off the ground, to be really accepted in Northern Ireland and Britain and to have a possibility of overcoming this enormous obstacle of exporting 90 per cent and only selling 10 per cent on the home market, Tony O'Reilly was brought in as general manager in 1966 and his solution immediately was to bring in Heinz to take over all the sales area of Erin Foods, not alone the 90 per cent exports but even the 10 per cent on the home market.  Without going too deeply into it, suffice it to say that within three years, from 1966 to 1969, from when that decision was made to bring in Heinz, the same Tony O'Reilly was shifted over to America as vice president of Heinz.</P>

      <P>I would mention to Deputy Mac Giolla that it is not the practice in the House to mention people outside the House in regard to any imputation of wrong doing because we have privilege here and we must be responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Chairman, thank you very much for your ruling; but that is an extraordinary remark, that we cannot mention anybody outside the House.  I am talking about history.  All I have said so far is that a man called Tony O'Reilly was brought in as general manager in <Col N="1281" /> place of General Costello in the Sugar Company in 1966 and that within three years, by 1969, he had gone from the Sugar Company and had become vice president of Heinz in America.  That is history.  I have said nothing about wrong doing.  There may be an implication of it when one thinks that it is amazing that within three years that should have happened. All I am saying is that he was general manager of Heinz Erin and had left the Sugar Company within three years.  I have done nothing but to give the facts of the case.  If one looks at the facts one may see an imputation of wrong doing.</P>
      <P>In any case, I think it is quite in order for people in this House to say so if they feel there has been wrong doing by somebody outside the House or inside the House.  I must make this point because in the past number of years the rights of Deputies are being eroded more and more.  When they raise something they are either told it is <i>sub judice</i> or that they cannot say this or that they cannot refer to somebody outside the House.  That makes total nonsense of Deputies rights. We are supposed to have more rights in here to talk about people than we have outside the House.  I would have no hesitation in saying everything I said here outside this House.  What I find is that the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Chairpersons are putting more and more restrictions on people speaking here about somebody outside the House.  Everything we say is about the whole outside world.  There are billions of people outside.  Everybody can lash Saddam Hussein forever.  Is it only Irish people outside the House that we are not allowed to talk about?  I think it is wrong that I should be told that I cannot say anything about somebody outside the House.  That is what we are here for, particularly if we feel there has been wrong doing that we should deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point I am making is that an opportunity existed in the sixties for a spectacular development in the Irish farming area.  I said then and I still say today that we have the potential for being the greatest food processor, certainly in Europe.  Before the 1987 election, the <Col N="1282" /> main plank of the Fianna Fáil platform in 1985 and 1986 was the number of jobs they were going to create in the food processing industry.  They had great plans.  We praised them at that time.  I certainly praised them because this area offered the possibility for the greatest number of jobs.  In talking about food processing I am not talking only of vegetable, meat or dairy processing but the development of food processing from the fish in the sea to everything that we can grow on the land.  This is an area where we can create not just hundreds of jobs, but thousands and tens of thousands of jobs.  I still think this can be done.  Fianna Fáil also saw that this could be done and I am sure they still see that is where the potential lies.  However, they made the major mistake when they came into power of putting all their goods in one basket.  Fianna Fáil had the vision that Mr. Larry Goodman &mdash; I know he is outside the House &mdash; was going to be the person to make the food processing industry, which would be of tremendous benefit to the whole State.  Fianna Fáil almost achieved a majority, but with the help of the Progressive Democrats they have a majority and are in power.  They tried this out, but it has not worked. Private enterprise does not work that way.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may have had a wonderful vision of what could happen in the food processing industry and how the beef industry could be developed so that we would not just be processing cuts for the supermarket but processing the food so that it was ready for the housewife. The Taoiseach may have had great ideas about how the dairy industry and the food processing industry could be developed. But to tell an individual in a private enterprise company that the Government will back that company to the extent of £200 million &mdash; the Taoiseach announced this at a public press conference &mdash; that the company could do the job and that is it, the vision is all gone, you are just giving a person a licence to make money and do what they feel is the right thing.  They could decide to go into beef because that looks good and they can make the money <Col N="1283" />&mdash; big bucks is what it is about and not that they will develop a fabulous food processing industry.</P>
    <P>Mr. Larry Goodman had great visions not alone of taking over the whole beef processing industry, which he had almost achieved and he certainly had the monopoly in the beef processing area, and then to move in and take over the dairy industry and then indeed the sugar company, not alone the Irish Sugar Company but the British Sugar Company.  This was a man with big vision but of course it has all collapsed now.  I wonder, though, if it has all collapsed, and this is one of the concerns I have about this Bill to privatise the Irish Sugar Company, that it will give a free hand to an individual or to individuals.</P>
    <P>Let us not make the mistake that this is partial privatisation, it is privatisation. As Deputy Sherlock has pointed out already, this golden share means nothing. The wording is that the Minister may, if he thinks fit, dispose of it.  The Goodman Company which has now been re-established &mdash; although the banks are clamouring at their back and are ready to pounce if they make a false move &mdash; are ready to move again.  Will Mr. Goodman be one of the people who will be ready to move on the Irish Sugar Company when the opportunity to privatise it comes up?  What could be more horrific? The greatest irony of all would be that the great Mr. Tony O'Reilly would come back from Heinz to take over the Irish Sugar Company, of which he was once general manager until the Erin Food interest was sold out.  One does not know who will come in but whoever it is he will not have the interests of the farmers, and the growers at heart.  He will not be interested in assisting the farmers with fertiliser and lime or making a deal with them every year on the price.  He will simply say &ldquo;this is our price this year, end of story&rdquo;.  There will be no negotiations. He will tell them that he can only afford to pay so much and they can either grow the product or not and if they do not grow it he will not mind because he can get sugar all over the world.  The world is full <Col N="1284" /> of sugar so there is no problem in that regard.  That is the line that will be taken with growers.  I cannot understand why the sugar beet growers are not paying more attention to this legislation because surely they understand how private enterprise works?  This is the way it has worked in many countries throughout the world. In America it is quite clear in private enterprise contracts with growers that, if you are out of business, it is &ldquo;Sorry, Bud, time to go&rdquo;.  That is how the market flies. They are put out of business and that is it.  The growers should understand that they will have no guarantees &mdash; they will have no guarantee of how much they will be paid for their sugar beet crop or whether they will be even asked to grow it.  This Bill does not guarantee that sugar beet will ever again be grown in Ireland. Private enterprise will take its raw material from the cheapest source and that will eventually happen here as well. Growers will be out of business because in another year or two sugar will probably be got from Cuba.  It is already available there, and many people are anxious to get hold of it.  Uncle Sam says no, but there is sugar available at cheap rates and that is how private enterprise operates.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise will tell workers what they will pay them and no more. They will also tell workers the hours of work and conditions, and if the workers do not like it, out they go.  There is no point in Deputies coming in and crying in the House that it would be terrible if this happened or that happened, if growers were not looked after and if the workers were not looked after, and that they hope the Bill will look after the interests of workers.  What a load of nonsense. Do they not understand how private enterprise works and what it is all about?</P>
    <P>The main point I want to make is that the privatisation of the Irish Sugar Company is not just like any other private sell off.  It is not just an ideological issue of private enterprise versus State enterprise. It encompasses agriculture and jobs and will have a major impact on the economic future of this country.  That is <Col N="1285" /> why I am so concerned about the legislation.</P>
    <P>This is an example of a core development. It is an example of what could have been done in many other areas. Everybody asks why we cannot have jobs for our young people.  Why are the people emigrating?  They emigrated in their tens, twenty and thirty thousands in the twenties.  Emigration increased in the thirties.  I recall the forties when the rate of emigration was at an enormous rate and even that increased in the fifties.  I watched whole families, with their big suitcases, going off on the trains at Westland Row and heading for the boat.  It was the most shattering experience of my life.  I thought that day was gone in the sixties when certain developments commenced, but the eighties have been just as bad &mdash; and just as tearful &mdash; although people went much faster because they travelled by plane.  They felt they could come home by plane any time they wished.  The problem is that it is very difficult to come home.  If you are doing very well you will stay out there but if you are not doing very well you will not come home and admit it, and the worse you do the harder it is to get home. People who are stuck on the streets, as many are in London, with neither a home nor a job &mdash; hungry and homeless &mdash; will find it very hard to come home to the embarrassment of their parents, relatives and friends, apart from the fact that they cannot even get the fare.</P>
    <P>Why do our people always have to face this horror of emigration?  They have to face it because there is no industrial development.  The multinationals came in the sixties.  We were abused for not objecting to multinationals coming to Ireland in the sixties and the seventies. We did not object because it was essential that we would have jobs to keep our people at home, but we always said the other side of the coin was to develop our economy and our industry.</P>
    <P>The way to develop industry is the way countries such as Norway did it.  People in Ireland think Norway is a huge country with fabulous resources.  Norway has far fewer resources than Ireland.  It has a <Col N="1286" /> huge mountain range 1,000 miles long from south to north with a few little valleys here and there where crops can be grown &mdash; that is their agriculture.  It has, however, a fisheries area around its coast, as we have, and on that they based their main industrial development, both their merchant and fishing fleets.  Whatever mineral wealth and timber they had they developed.  If you have timber you process it and finally end up manufacturing paper plus all the other processes of the timber industry.  If you have minerals you have a smelter and make use of the minerals. Here Tara Mines has been taken over by a Finnish State company who themselves are running out of minerals. They have the smelters so they buy our Tara Mines for their smelters to provide jobs for their people.  Parts, machines and the domestic equipment are made from our lead and zinc which they import.  Out of our fabulous mineral resources we have 200 jobs, while Finland or the other smelters in Belgium, France and so on are creating thousands of jobs from our ore.</P>
    <P>The same is true of our timber industry. Some years ago I was down in Woodfab where the general manager showed me the wood chippings that were being exported to Finland.  He told me that the very boat that took out those wood chippings came back into Dublin port, five or six months later, with huge rolls of paper which we were importing.</P>
    <P>We have a similar position in relation to food processing which should be the first and easiest area to develop industrially. Every Government have failed miserably and every Government are responsible for emigration.  Yesterday I quoted from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds &mdash; he quoted what he had been told by the Government and the Taoiseach &mdash; who said that it was not the responsibility of Government to create jobs.  That is the sort of thing that sickens people outside of this House. What do you mean: &ldquo;It is not the responsibility of Government to create jobs&rdquo;. There are 240,000 people out there who think it is the responsibility of the Government to create jobs, and there are <Col N="1287" /> another 120,000 emigrating because they have no jobs.  That is the responsibility of the Government, and it is their responsibility to ensure that the jobs in the sugar industry and of the farmers who grow beet are protected.  This Government are supposed to be the Government of the small farmers.  What in heavens name have they ever done for the small farmers?  It is only when the small farmer is over in London that he begins to think about that and says: &ldquo;I was voting for that crowd for the last 25 years, what did they ever do for me&rdquo;?  That is what they are saying all the time when they have left.  When they are at home they say: &ldquo;I suppose they are the best&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Workers' Party are terrible in any case, they are against the farmers but Fianna Fáil are a nice crowd, they do not tax the big farmers&rdquo;.  The small farmer should never be in the tax net in any case. Because we talk about taxing the big farmers we are supposed to be antifarmer.</P>
    <P>The State started with about 380,000 land holders; today the number is 160,000.  That is fewer than half the number when the State was founded and yet every Government in this State said: &ldquo;We are for the farmers.&rdquo;  They fight each other as to which of them is most for the farmers; who is for the big farmers and who is for the small farmers?  Every one of them fought for farmers tooth and nail, but the farmers were shutting their doors and heading off to England, New York, Australia and to God knows where.</P>
    <P>People are now being told to learn more languages, to go to Europe and go to Germany where there they are told there are jobs all over the place.  We now have a very highly educated young population and it is marvellous to see them going off to Boston, Sydney, London, even to Germany and France where some of them are doing so well, but that is only about 10 per cent of the people who are being exported; the vast majority are not highly educated young people.  The vast majority are over there looking for a job in an hotel, washing dishes, sweeping the streets or on <Col N="1288" /> building sites or whatever they can get. That is where they are working and getting jobs; yet all the possibilities are in the food processing area.  I appeal again to Fianna Fáil to look at the possibilities in the food processing area.  I know we are wasting our time because of the unity between the Government, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats on the issue of privatising the Sugar Company.  I am not sure what the Labour Party position is in regard to this issue.  It is important that they state their position, as the workers in the industry will want to know what it is.</P>
    <P>It is very important that a stand be made on this proposal.  Not only will it put the jobs of the workers at risk but it will also put a question mark over the future development of our processing and farming industries.  As Michael Dillon said some time last year, the present number of farmers will be reduced from 150,000 to approximately 50,000 in 20 or 30 years' time and to about 10,000 in 60 years' time.  The result of what is being done at present will be that small farmers will have to leave the land and it will be grabbed up by bigger farmers who will control the decisions which are made.</P>
    <P>What is the advantage of putting the Irish Sugar Company into private hands if in 20 or 30 years' time a handful of farmers will control the land and a handful of private entrepreneurs will control industry and import their raw materials from abroad?  The main flaw we see in this legislation is that no thought has been given to the social effects the privatisation of the Irish Sugar Company, will have.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party are opposed to the privatisation of the Sugar Company.  We have constantly pointed out the number of jobs which can be created in both fisheries and agriculture by the development of our food processing industry. The development of Erin Foods gave an idea of what could be done for farmers and workers in the production of raw materials for the food processing sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I <Col N="1289" /> should like to congratulate all those involved in the preparation of this Bill, which proposes, as the Minister said, the partial privatisation of the Sugar Company. I have no doubt that the company will go from strength to strength in the future.  I wish them every success in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have had many disagreements with the Sugar Company since I entered politics almost 16 years ago.  In particular, I have disagreed with them over their decision to close the Tuam sugar factory, which affected small farmers, the workers in the factory and those involved in the haulage business in Tuam and other western areas.  The brave decision made by the Sugar Company in the thirties to locate a factory in Tuam resulted in contracts to smallholders in the area to provide beet.  That decision was greatly welcomed by those farmers and it led to great activity in the area.  At one time over 700 people were employed in the sugar factory in Tuam.  However, for various reasons &mdash; I will refer to these later &mdash; the great plans for this factory did not materialise.  As Deputy Mac Giolla pointed out, Erin Foods were involved in the Tuam factory and attempts were made by the company over the years to close the factory by stealth.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister refer to the success of what he called the joint venture schemes.  He gave as an example the creation of 180 jobs in his area by the end of 1990 through joint venture schemes and the target of 384 extra jobs by the end of 1992.  I should like to know more about these schemes. Since the Tuam factory was closed in 1986 there have been no joint venture schemes in the area.  It should be remembered that the factory in Tuam was closed at the end of 1986 while the Thurles factory was not closed until a year or two later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that the Sugar Company will become involved in industrial development in Tuam. Before Christmas the Minister informed me by way of a statement that it had been agreed by the company and community groups in Tuam that the company would provide a free site and a contribution of <Col N="1290" /> £2 million towards the establishment of a new industry in Tuam.  He said:</P>
    <P>Last September, the company finalised details with the IDA and a private developer for the construction of a 20,000 sq. ft. advance factory on 1.5 acres of the old sugar factory site at Tuam.  Siúicre Éireann have provided the site free, and have agreed to pay the cost of developing it and providing services etc.  In addition, the company has undertaken to guarantee the rent for the new factory for a maximum period of three years or until a tenant is found.  It is hoped to start building work on the new factory in January 1991.  The company has also agreed to build a second advance factory on the old sugar factory site at Tuam.  Siúicre Éireann's involvement will be on the exact same terms as those applying to the first advance factory.  Building of the second advance factory will commence as soon as a tenant is found for the first one.</P>
    <P>When the second factory has been completed and a tenant found, the company will review the situation, with particular reference to its total investment in the new projects.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, and as part of the £2 million contribution, the company will contribute £250,000 to Action Tuam Ltd. towards the purchase and construction of an Enterprise Centre at the Weir Road, Tuam. In fact £150,000 of this contribution was, I understand, paid last month and the balance of £100,000 will be paid in May 1991.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank the Minister for that statement.  However, I want to ask him why he made no reference in his speech in the House to this contribution of £2 million.  It is worth remembering that he said in the statement that two advance factories would be built on a site provided free by Siúicre Éireann and that the company had agreed to pay the cost of developing it and providing services. While I welcome that statement, obviously advance factories are of no use unless people are working in them.  I want <Col N="1291" /> to stress again that over 700 people were employed in the factory in Tuam at one stage.  I want more employment to be created in the town.  While this is beginning to happen at present, I would be much happier if the Sugar Company spelt out in more detail what they are going to do. I should like joint venture schemes such as those which have worked so well in Thurles to be approved for Tuam.</P>
    <P>Of the £2 million only £0.25 million has been committed to be paid, leaving £1.75 million yet to be provided.  The company may say they will provide the site free, develop it and pay the rent on the buildings for a maximum of three years; but I am still not satisfied that their total involvement will amount to £2 million. The Sugar Company have created those jobs in Tuam but they cannot walk away from a town with serious unemployment and emigration when they have not given details of what they propose to do in the industrial development of the town.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the various Ministers for Agriculture who provided equity for the company in recent years.  The biggest amount of money given to the company was in 1982 when Deputy Brian Lenihan, as Minister for Agriculture, provided £30 million. Deputy Austin Deasy &mdash; I would like to pay tribute to him as he is in the House at the moment &mdash; when he was Minister in 1983 provided £20 million and in 1987 Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, as Minister for Agriculture, provided £9 million.  An effort was made by successive Governments to help the company and the people working in that area.  It was not only the workers in the company who benefited, but the beet growers also received an income from the industry and people got employment in the factory at Christmas for what is known as &ldquo;The Campaign&rdquo;, a very important period coming up to Christmas.  People working in the haulage business also benefited from the industry.  There was a knock-on effect for the whole town of Tuam and for the greater Tuam area.</P>
    <P>What I find most objectionable is that in recent years this factory received many <Col N="1292" /> blows from the company.  For example, they removed the freight and pulp subsidies and discontinued the rail link with Airgloone.  All these actions succeeded in undermining the factory at Tuam.</P>
    <P>When difficulties arose with the potato factory, the Sugar Company established Tuam Engineering.  The workers in that company provided a great service for the people in the area and indeed for CSET. The engineering works are still in operation but they are under a lot of pressure at present.  Before Christmas the workers there were put in an impossible position when they were asked to take a 10 per cent cut in income and to accept reduced pension and superannuation rights. Redundancies were also sought.  When the Minister is considering guaranteeing the rights of workers, he should give some thought to Tuam Engineering.  An investigation should be undertaken as to why the engineering works are not getting sufficient work from the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>I was very happy to hear the Minister talk about the general restructuring of the food industry in Europe and the increased numbers of mergers and acquisitions.  Even though the Irish food companies will never be as big as those in the US or Europe, I believe they can succeed.  They have shown a great willingness to come together and provide for development.  In the Connacht region the three co-operatives, Midwest, Kiltoghert and the North Connacht Farmers have come together as one and pooled their resources in the dairy sector.  Next Monday the Minister for Agriculture will launch a new low fat dairy butter spread in Sligo for that co-operative.  I hope this development will continue in other areas.</P>
    <P>We have had in this House for many years a committee to oversee the semi-State sector, the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies. That is a very important committee to which I would refer in commenting on the Sugar Company and their disengagement from Tuam and Thurles.  That committee recommended that there would be no question of closing the sugar factory in Tuam until alternative employment was provided, but that did not happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> Deputy Mac Giolla referred to the fact that the Goodman group were grant-aided with a number of projects throughout the country, the first of which was to be in Tuam where 70 jobs would be provided with an investment of £14 million.  I regret that did not happen, but we cannot blame one individual.  We now have to find alternative employment.  The IDA are trying to do that in places like Tuam and Thurles and I hope they succeed. What now remains on the Tuam Factory site are the Tuam Engineering Works, sugar packaging and animal feeds.  The Minister has provided in the Bill that the workers there will be guaranteed their pension and superannuation rights and I am happy about that; but, as I have said, what I am not happy about is that the engineering works are not getting enough work from the company.</P>
    <P>I regret that, as happens in a lot of semi-State bodies, what is called voluntary redundancy turns out to be compulsory redundancy.  This matter has arisen in the past few weeks with regard to An Post, who want to shed 1,500 jobs. It arose also in Bord na Móna and in the Sugar Company.  Voluntary redundancy is offered until a certain date &mdash; usually not enough time is given &mdash; and as soon as that date passes the employees are told they will have to accept statutory redundancy.  I hope the Minister will put down an amendment on Committee Stage to guarantee the rights of workers on and after the transfer date.  Employees will not suffer less favourable terms in relation to their pensions or superannuation scheme after the transfer date.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, I am very critical of the Sugar Company in relation to the factory in Tuam.  I can never understand why, over the years, the question of cost penalty was always raised in regard to Tuam and Thurles.  As I understand it, these costs were allocated by head office to smaller factories in the scheme.  It is most unfortunate that that phrase was introduced and, even though the Sugar Company are going well, it was the closure of two factories which led to their healthy financial position.  We could <Col N="1294" /> probably close all the sugar factories in Ireland if the cost penalty was too high and import sugar from Cuba &mdash; or from wherever it is plentiful &mdash; but that is not the way to proceed in future.  I hope, when partial privatisation takes place, that the company will grow.  I congratulate them for turning their finances around, but they were at fault in the way they treated Tuam.</P>
    <P>We have problems in regard to emigration and unemployment and people who worked in and were taught skills by the Sugar Company are setting up small industries.  However, I hope that we will now have a forward looking and successful company in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>As I come from the Mallow area, this legislation is of great importance to me.  Indeed it is vital that the legislation, which I am sure will be put through the House over the next number of weeks, will provide a sound and secure base in future for the Sugar Company.</P>
      <P>We are very fortunate in Mallow to have one of the two remaining sugar factories in the country.  I heard the criticisms this morning regarding what happened &mdash; it might be more accurate to say what has not happened &mdash; since the closure of the factories in Thurles and Tuam.  It is vital that the measures which the Minister intends to bring forward will ensure the strengthening of our two factories. In the Mallow area, the Irish Sugar Company play a vital economic role, indeed it is one of the major economic planks of the north Cork area.  Many hundreds of families are dependent on it for permanent and seasonal employment and farmers depend on it as a source of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times the agricultural area in north Cork has, in a sense, been hit by the forced rationalisation of a certain number of co-operatives.  As a result of this and the formation of one of the new super co-operatives &mdash; Kerrygold Co-operative &mdash; a number of workers, unfortunately, will be laid off; as a result of quota cutbacks in milk, farmers' options will be reduced. Because of these two factors it is vital that <Col N="1295" /> our other major agri-industry in north Cork, the Sugar Company, will continue to thrive and prosper and, as a result of this legislation have their future secured.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy made the initial reply on behalf of Fine Gael last month and he outlined our views and fears.  He said that the Minister is not going far enough to direct the Sugar Company into new options and openings.  Like my colleague, Deputy Deasy, I welcome this legislation but it is not the be-all and end-all as far as the Sugar Company are concerned. We need from the Minister &mdash; which we did not get in his Second Stage speech &mdash; a clear policy statement and direction for the company which, I hope, will lead to the company being a leader in the vegetable industry.  It is important that the Greenvale Company &mdash; as they will be called &mdash; play a role as a leading vegetable processor and, through that, bring about a major increase in the number of people working in this area.</P>
    <P>The reason the legislation is before us is that the Irish Sugar Company urgently need funds to survive and prepare for the challenges of 1992, to prepare for the changes after 1992, to prepare for the challenges which will certainly emerge as a result of the GATT proposals and the liberalisation of trade after the GATT talks.  If this funding is to be made available there is really no other option.  If we were living in an ideal world, if the Irish taxpayer was willing &mdash; or able &mdash; to pay more than at present, it would perhaps be more pleasant all round if the Government continued to fund the Sugar Company. Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world and the sort of funding which may have been available in the seventies and eighties is no longer available. Because of that, we must look at this in a realistic light and at the options for funding in relation to the Sugar Company. When all is said and done, when the debate has been concluded, it will be seen that the Minister's option is the correct one.</P>
    <P>When I was a Member of the Seanad I served on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and <Col N="1296" /> one of the bodies which the committee examined was the Sugar Company. During the many interviews we had with Sugar Company personnel on our visits to plants throughout the country and the many hours of discussion on the whole question of the Irish Sugar Company's future, most members of the committee were convinced that the future of the company lay in some form of partial privatisation.</P>
    <P>When the legislation was introduced a month or so ago, the Minister outlined the three options which faced him, or indeed any Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The first option, which was to leave things as they were, might work for the next two or three years but, unfortunately, it would not be adequate post-1992 and GATT.  When the taxpayer is unable, through the Government, to put extra funding into the company, it is not a realistic option.  The second option was the total privatisation of the Sugar Company and indeed it is not long since there appeared to be a strong possibility that a major player in the food industry was a serious option as far as total privatisation was concerned.  That major player has diminished somewhat but, apart from that, I hope that total privatisation was not considered as a serious option.  The third option, which we are debating and which will obviously be put into practice, is partial privatisation.  It is a reasonable and positive step forward and it will ensure that the Sugar Company will be viable long into the nineties.  It will ensure that the company can grow, prosper and continue not just to maintain employment but to create it in other areas.  It will mean that the company can continue to be a major source of income for the farming community.</P>
    <P>People in the Sugar Company are, naturally, worried about their jobs and others have attempted to spread scare tactics throughout the industry.  The biggest threat to jobs would come if we did not act.  Their jobs will be under threat if everybody decides not to do anything in the hope&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The vast majority of the workers and managers of the Irish Sugar Company are realistic enough to know that the ideas being promoted by Deputy Sherlock in 1991 are out of date and are being discarded in all those countries in Europe where they were accepted.  It is ironic that the economic system which Deputy Sherlock and his party are trying to foist on us has been rejected by its proponents and that his former political friends and allies in Eastern Europe have realised that what we are proposing, partial privatisation, is the only way forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the threat to the jobs of the workforce will be far greater if the Government or the Oireachtas decide to do nothing and just hope for the best.  There is not just a duty but a responsibility on us to face up to the difficulties confronting the Sugar Company and to bring forward realistic proposals.  What has been put forward is a step in the right direction and I am glad therefore to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies have questioned whether the introduction of the golden share will ensure that the Sugar Company will remain in the control of Irish hands. I am confident that both the Minister and <Col N="1298" /> the Oireachtas will ensure that it will.  It has been pointed out that any changes would require the approval of the Minister, but I appeal to him to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage that any such changes would require the approval of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned that there is a possibility of extra jobs being created in the vegetable and horticulture industry following the passage of this legislation. It is my hope that Greenvale plc will become the market leader so far as the processing of vegetables is concerned.  I am glad that the Minister of State with responsibility for horticulture is present in the House to listen to my remarks.  I think he would be the first to admit that, despite the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his predecessors, the food and vegetable sector has not been developed in the way it should and that we are not providing many options in this sector for farmers and growers.  I hope, however, that the passing of this legislation will lead to them being given more options at a time when there are severe cutbacks in other sectors.  That is the reason I feel that not only are we taking a step forward so far as the Sugar Company are concerned but, more importantly, a step forward so far as the food and vegetable sector are concerned. Greenvale plc will play a major role in the food processing sector in the years ahead and can become a major employer.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the workers in the Sugar Company be given a cast iron guarantee in this legislation that their pension rights will be maintained.  I urge the Minister, when replying to the debate, to reassure us in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know what the Minister's views are on the question of worker directors.  These were involved in the board when major and difficult decisions had to be taken, some of which they may not have agreed with, but they lived up to their responsibilities in a very mature and far-seeing way.  Having regard to the fact that they played such an important role in the development of the company in recent years, I hope the Minister will give a commitment that they <Col N="1299" /> will be allowed to play a role on the new board of Greenvale plc.</P>
    <P>Is it the Minister's intention that the growers would also be represented on the board of the new company?  They wish to make their views known and would like to see many changes made.  Their views should be brought to the attention of the board and because of this I feel they should be represented on the board.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill deals with the sale of shares in the new company.  I am glad that both workers and growers will be given the opportunity to buy shares and I hope they will take up this option.  I have no doubt but that they will base their decisions on what the long term future will hold for the company.  Shared-ownership should lead to more mature decision making at all levels of the company. I would certainly encourage both workers and farmers to take out shares and to continue to play a major part in the running of the company.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 5,000 sugar beet growers in the country.  Their association have informed us that they have two main concerns, the first of which relates to the management of the Irish sugar quota.  They have asked that there be co-management of the quota.  This is a very reasonable request and would guarantee that any decisions on the sale and distribution of the quota would only be made after full consultation with all interested parties.  I support this request. Even though the figure represents only 2 per cent of the total European Community quota, it is of vital importance to the 5,000 growers who would otherwise have very few options.  It is therefore in their interest that we strive to maintain the quota at its present level.</P>
    <P>The quota system as at present construed offers little hope or opportunity for new growers to enter the sugar beet field.  As a public representative I have been inundated with requests from people who wish to obtain a sugar beet quota and, unfortunately, there is very little I or any public representative can do for them.  I feel that young trained farmers who have completed their Green <Col N="1300" /> Certificate in Agriculture, have perhaps obtained a farm installation grant and are fully fledged farmers in every sense of the term, fully prepared to meet the challenges of the nineties which farming offers, deserve whatever priority can be given when we allocate quota.  These young people are up to date and <i>au fait</i> with all the new technologies of farming, all the new machinery and all the challenges and they should have some sort of priority when we allocate what quotas we can from time to time.  I hope new opportunities will be available in the farming field for our younger farmers.</P>
    <P>The second major concern of the growers and their representatives is payment for sugar beet as it is at present.  My colleague, Deputy Browne, mentioned the term &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; sugar this morning. That, I believe, is a semi-technical term. Most farmers I know in the sugar beet industry always feel they are not receiving their full and just entitlement in payment. This problem remains with us after many years and it comes up for debate annually.  When we are setting out on a new road and when we are beginning to set up a new company, we must address once and for all and bring to a conclusion this question of the payment system.  Not only must the payment be fair; more important, it must be seen to be fair.  I hope the new board and the new organisation will ensure fair payment for beet to farmers so they can at least be contented that they are getting an adequate reward for their labours in this respect. The Minister might like to comment on that in his reply.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start, overall I welcome the proposal.  It is a positive move as far as the Irish Sugar Company, the farmers and the workers are concerned.  Let me repeat my one little doubt that the Minister in a sense is not laying out a clear policy statement for the future of the Sugar Company and the vegetable industry. I hope he will reflect on that over the next few months and that in the long term we will see the Irish Sugar Company being a major employer and a major producer of wealth in rural Ireland and that there will be many related industries in <Col N="1301" /> the food and vegetable industry doing likewise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak on this Bill.  Since I reached the age of reason I remember reading <i>Beet It</i>, a production by the Sugar Company which told us what was happening in the company, and I found it very interesting.  The Sugar Company have been of vital importance to the rural community since the thirties, especially in Cork east.  We have a factory based in Mallow and thousands of farmers supplying beet.  Also we had two vegetable factories, Erin Foods in Midleton and Erin Foods in Mallow, both of which were closed down by the Sugar Company; but I will come to those later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The sugar beet crop is the most profitable tillage crop, as far as I am aware at this moment; so it is very important for farmers and all involved, whether they are agricultural contractors, hauliers, workers in the factory or farmers producing beet, that this industry be kept in operation at its present rate. I suppose the price some farmers are complaining about, as Deputy Bradford said in his excellent contribution, would be for the supply of over quota beet.  That causes some concern, but I suppose if a person is paid for his quota there can be little crib if he gets something for what he is supplying over and above one quota and putting a glut into the market.  They are getting the full price at quota level and, depending on the year and the demand, the over quota supply varies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main concerns employers have relates to the control of the quota and who will be responsible for its distribution after Greenvale plc have been set up.  It is vital that the control lies in the hands of the company, the suppliers and the Government.  A varied number of institutions should be involved in controlling the quota.  The problem is that if you have only one institution responsible they may make decisions in their own interest only.  As happens generally, that <Col N="1302" /> institution are the company and they do not take into account the workers and suppliers in making their decisions. Therefore, it is vital that all the elements involved in this industry have a say in the control of the quota.</P>
    <P>It is important that farmers and workers take advantage of section 2 of the Bill and purchase shares on the flotation.  When they have a financial holding in the company as well as an interest in earning their living out of it, they will take an interest in how the management of the company operate.  Therefore, I urge farmers and workers to purchase shares when these become available.</P>
    <P>Concern for the rights of the workers has rightly been expressed, and I must say the statement by the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, should allay worries in this field.  What he said in his speech regarding the workers' rights is worth repeating, and I quote from the Official Report, volume 404, column 803, 30 January, 1991:</P>
    <P>The position is that workers' interests are already protected under the European Communities &mdash; safeguarding of employees' rights on transfer of undertaking &mdash; Regulations, 1989.  However, in order to reassure workers on this point I intend moving, on Committee Stage, an amendment underlying the rights of employees. This will provide specifically that the rights which employees of Siúicre Éireann, or its subsidiaries, hold before the date on which the Minister for Finance transfers his shares in Siúicre Éireann to the new holding company will continue to be held by them on and from that transfer date.  Provision will also be made to ensure that employees will not suffer any less favourable terms under their pension or superannuation schemes, after that transfer date...</P>
    <P>...Siúicre Éireann has indicated to ICTU a willingness to confirm formally a number of commitments, in writing, <Col N="1303" /> relating to employees' conditions subsequent to the restructuring of the company.</P>
    <P>These commitments are worth repeating and are as follows:</P>
    <P>no interruption in continuity of employment; current rates of pay and conditions of employment will continue to apply; continued recognition of existing trade unions; and existing procedures for determining rates of pay and conditions of employment including redundancy terms, will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>He said that the company were willing to register these commitments in the Labour Court and with the new Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <P>The European Commission has been giving some thought to the question of CAP reform for several months now.  At the meeting of EC Agriculture Ministers on 4-5 February 1991 Commissioner MacSharry presented a communication in the form of a &ldquo;Reflections Paper of the Commission&rdquo; regarding the development and future of the CAP.  This &ldquo;reflections paper&rdquo; broadly surveyed the recent evolution of the policy, evaluated the adjustments made since 1985 and set forth objectives and guidelines for the future development of the CAP.  The &ldquo;reflections paper&rdquo; is not a proposal, as Deputy Deasy suggests, but has the purpose of instigating debate on the reform process. <Col N="1305" /> There was general recognition at the Agriculture Council that the process of CAP adjustment is likely to be a protracted one.  Given the Commission's apparent intention to table a farm-prices' package for 1991-92 shortly, it is unlikely that detailed proposals for longer-term reform in most sectors will emerge for some months yet.</P>
    <P>At the Agriculture Council on 4-5 February 1991 Commissioner MacSharry's ideas drew a mixed response.  Ministers accepted that maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> on the CAP was untenable and there was general agreement that fundamental reform of the CAP was now necessary. There was, however, a wide divergence of opinion on how the reform was to be accomplished.  In the course of my contribution to the Council debate, I made it clear that, whereas Ireland would not be opposed in principle to necessary adjustment of the CAP's market mechanisms, we would vehemently object to any measures which might undermine the overall effectiveness of the policy, dilute its fundamental principles or discriminate against natural production based on efficient use of grassland.  These basic considerations will continue to inform the Government's attitude towards the detailed reform proposals which the Commission has undertaken to submit to the Council.</P>
    <P>I have consistently asserted that smaller scale producers and those facing specific handicaps have to be protected and that such protection should be built into the market organisations themselves. In principle, then, the Government would not oppose those aspects of the Commission's ideas on agricultural policy adjustment which aim to provide increased income protection for smaller family farms.  However, we also recognise that the maintenance of a competitive food industry as well as the viability of much of rural society requires that the commercially viable element in our agriculture is not undermined.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Government's definitive position on CAP reform must await the presentation of proposals by the Commission.  However I can say that <Col N="1306" /> whatever proposals emerge from the Commission should respect our vital agricultural interests and afford the fullest safeguards for the future of all categories of family farmers.  I have made it abundantly clear at the Council that the agri-food sector is the dynamo of the Irish economy and that any adjustments to the policy must reflect and respect that fact.</P>
    <P>The Commission paper acknowledges that any reforms must respect the fundamental principles of the CAP.  I expect, therefore, that the detailed proposals, whenever they emerge, will clearly respect those principles viz. a single market, Community preference and financial solidarity.</P>

      <P>Whether it be a paper or set of proposals my question to the Minister is: why did he not categorically reject what was put forward?  Will the Minister protect Ireland's vital national interest?  Will the Minister plead the case we made in 1983 to 1984 that Ireland has a special position where European agricultural matters are concerned?  If that position is not protected, is the Minister prepared to veto the proposals in their present form, or something approaching their present form?</P>

      <P>Deputy Deasy, of all people, should know that there are no proposals on the table.  As a former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy should also know that one does not emerge in negotiations on the basis of leaks from any institution.  The Deputy should recognise from his experience that the best way of protecting the vital interests to which I referred is to wait until we have proposals while, at the same time, signalling &mdash; in relation to general principles &mdash; what exactly we expect to be reflected in those proposals.  I do not want to say anything about 1984.  But there will be many small Irish farmers who will feel they were very badly neglected when the quota system was introduced in 1984 when Deputy Deasy was Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="1307" /> agree that his reply today is totally at variance with the statement he is reputed to have made when he met the Northern Ireland Minister for Food and was quoted in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, as saying that, in any reformation of CAP, there was a place in agriculture for larger farmers and small, efficient farmers, and warning that small, inefficient farmers could not be maintained on the land just because they existed?  That was the Minister's statement on 13 February 1991 reported by Mr. Dick Cullinane, saying that small farmers, because of the difficulties they had and were experiencing at present, were inefficient and, therefore, there was no place for them.  Would the Minister agree that that was a very damning statement on the part of any Minister at this time?</P>

      <P>It is a very damaging, misinterpretation and distortion of what someone would wish the Minister to be represented as saying.  I answered a specific question on this matter yesterday, by way of written reply, which is on the record.  In case the Deputy has not seen it let me repeat: I never made a statement as Deputy Kavanagh has just represented it now.  In commenting on what the Northern Ireland Minister said &mdash; and he did seem to have a view about small farms not necessarily being efficient &mdash; I said that obviously efficient farming, whether one was talking about large or small farms, was the only basis on which one could guarantee viability.  I never implied that small farms, as such, would not and were not viable.  That would be totally contrary to my conviction and that of the Government.  I can assure the Deputy that that is not the position.</P>

That is such a ridiculous question to ask.  Let me just tell Deputy Deasy what will be my position.  I will continue in coming months, as I have done over the past four years, to particularly recruit support, understanding and influence at Council level among my colleagues.  I think I have achieved that fairly satisfactorily.  If the occasion arises &mdash; and I will not speculate as to what action might arise on proposals, when they are proposals &mdash; I will take whatever action is necessary, but I will be doing so with the full support and understanding of my colleagues on the Agriculture Council which is how I think negotiations would be best conducted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the priority given to the agri-food industry in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> a five year strategy for the food and drink industry covering the period 1988-1992 was drawn up by the IDA in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The basic aim of that strategy is to prepare the industry to compete effectively on European and world food markets, and thus maximise its contribution to the national economy by, in particular, addressing weaknesses in areas such as marketing, management, product development and scale.  That general approach was endorsed in the recent report of the Agriculture and Food Policy Review Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am satisfied that, so far the strategy which I have outlined has proved very successful, obviously changing circumstances may require that it be adapted.  In this connection the Government have stated in the recently negotiated <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that in the light of the ongoing negotiations on the reform of the CAP and the report of the policy review group they intend to review all national policies relating to agriculture <Col N="1310" /> and food with a view to drawing up a new development programme for the sector.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand how the Minister of State can give that kind of reply to my question when he knows well that the job situation in the food industry is not good and that food exports have been declining in the past 12 months.  A document, 225/90, was issued by the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the operational programme for rural development and a small sum of just £4 million was earmarked for horticulture. Is the Minister of State aware that since the amalgamation of Mitchelstown and Ballyclough, and the formation of Dairygold, it is proposed to halve the workforce in Mitchelstown, and that the cheese is being imported?  Can the Minister say what part of this policy that has been drafted between the Department and the IDA is being put into effect?  Will the Minister assure us that the situation will now be taken seriously and the potential of our food industry will be fully developed?</P>

It is unfair and inaccurate to say that exports have not been increasing over the past few years, they have increased very substantially. Overall jobs have been increasing as well.  I appreciate that there has been a number of direct job losses, but in the main they have been made up by an increase in the number of service jobs where people have gone from direct employment into indirect employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 4, 67, and 81 together.</P>
      <P>In July, 1990, I introduced regulations to deal specifically with the problem of beta-agonists and of any other illegal growth promoter which might be developed in the future.</P>
      <P>Under these regulations the manufacture, importation, sale, possession and use of all unauthorised substances are prohibited.  Additionally, veterinary inspectors in slaughtering facilities are empowered on suspicion to detain, test and examine any animal or meat.  If the results of such testing confirm the presence of beta-agonists or any other illegal substance the animal or meat will be condemned. Following detection of an illegal substance an investigation is carried out at the farm of origin.  This involves locking up the farm and testing the herd.  If evidence of possession or use of illegal substances is detected legal proceedings will be instituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> I launched an intensive campaign at farm level last November and since then 74 herds have been investigated of which ten were found to be using beta-agonists. Legal proceedings are in train against these herdowners.  This campaign will be continued.</P>
    <P>Random and suspicious testing of carcases at factory level over the past year under an EC approved plan has yielded negative results in all cases.  I am therefore satisfied that meat containing residues of beta-agonists is not entering the food chain.  On the question of safety of meat for human consumption it must be borne in mind that the active ingredient of Angel Dust &mdash; clenbuterol &mdash; may, in the form of an authorised veterinary medicine, be safely administered to food producing animals provided the correct dosage and withdrawal period are observed.  Those most at risk are not consumers but persons using and handling Angel Dust.</P>
    <P>My Department have not identified any decline in beef and cattle sales associated with the recent publicity regarding the availability and use of beta-agonists. However, there is no doubt but that widespread abuse of this substance will damage the reputation of our meat industry. I have made all sections of the industry aware of the vital national importance of protecting the quality and reputation of our beef on the markets and of my determination to take the most rigorous action against any irresponsible and unrepresentative elements who would attempt to use or encourage the use of these substances.</P>
    <P>The tendency to use the illegal growth promoter known as Angel Dust is a very unwelcome problem.  I have introduced stringent regulations to deal with the situation and I am determined to stamp this problem out.</P>
    <P>The resolution of this problem is clearly within the control of the industry itself.  It faces a clear choice as to whether it wishes to embark on the road of creating an industry dependent on the use of these substances.  I am satisfied, and I think most people would agree with <Col N="1313" /> me, that it is not the direction in which we should go.</P>
    <P>The confidence of consumers, the reputation of our beef industry and our access to vital export markets are at stake.  They cannot be risked by the irresponsible action of a small group and I am taking the most stringent action to protect and maintain the quality and reputation of our beef on international markets.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures which have been taken are adequate and, indeed, are more comprehensive than those applicable in other member states. I have been pressing for a harmonised Community approach on this issue, but, if at any stage the necessity for further measures becomes apparent, appropriate action will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that this is a very delicate subject and that the use of this substance is very dangerous for the future of our beef industry.  It is a case of greed overtaking commonsense and the national interest.  Will the Minister provide additional resources and if necessary introduce legislation to make it non profitable for people who are using this substance to use it, because they will destroy the beef trade?  Even the rate the Minister mentioned of ten out of 74 herds being affected by this growth promoter, is far too high.  It may not affect our beef sales at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The most rigorous action will follow when the prosecutions are taken. That in itself will be a major disincentive. <Col N="1314" /> The penalties we have put in place are very heavy indeed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the problems of low farm family income currently being suffered by some farming families in common with families outside the farming community.</P>
      <P>In the agricultural sector very many measures are in operation which provide support and assistance to farmers.  The EC-funded market support measures help the producer to benefit from returns considerably above what the market would provide; subsidies under the disadvantaged areas programme and all other livestock schemes are of particular benefit to low income farmers.</P>
      <P>Over £300 million was paid out on these schemes in 1990 by comparison with £160 million in 1989.  In addition, a further £40 million was paid in 1990 under western package measures and farm development programmes.  The operational programme for rural development is one of a number of programmes aimed at the improvement of incomes and living standards of those living in rural areas, especially farmers.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the priority accorded the problem of low income families in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> I have initiated the preparation of an income aid scheme to address the problem of low income farmers for which provision was made in this year's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> Unemployment assistance is paid by the Department of Social Welfare to farmers who can satisfy a means test of their income levels.  With the extension, reclassification and increased payments under disadvantaged areas schemes which I intend to put in place this year, extra payments of approximately £28 million will be made to farmers in disadvantaged areas, which should now extend to 72 per cent of the national territory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister accepts that there is real hardship on many family farms.  Would he agree that action is necessary on a number of fronts? Regarding the extension of the disadvantaged areas, a matter the Minister has been fiddling around with for the past three years, he should get it out of the way and stop messing.  Regarding disadvantaged farmers, some of whom are living outside disadvantaged areas, will the Minister focus a package which will reach them, either through existing Community instruments or by direct income aids?  Does he accept the position of disadvantaged farmers and will he ensure that there is some instrument or series of instruments whereby they can be reached?  Will he also consider opening up discussions with his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, in relation to farmer's dole?  Farmers have difficulties because of being assessed on the basis of the income for the previous year.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends to introduce measures to relieve hardship imposed on herdowners where the disease bovine leucosis is detected, arising from the low compensation and the lock up of restriction period of two years on the herd; and if he will allow the small number of leucosis-positive herds in the country the same freedom and concession for depopulation as now operates for herds affected by BSE.</Quest>

      <P>Special measures are being finalised which will facilitate herd owners, whose holdings are restricted due to enzootic bovine leukosis, to slaughter surplus animals in order to relieve overstocking.  The measures will be in the form of <i>ex gratia</i> payments up to certain defined limits and payable in respect of slaughtered animals.  Herdowners, who are understood to be over-stocked, have been notified that my Department will contact them shortly in this regard.</P>
      <P>In a small number of cases where there was justification on veterinary grounds total depopulation has been effected. Similar action in relation to the remaining restricted herds would not be warranted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that on veterinary grounds depopulation is allowed where bovine leucosis is detected.  However on trade grounds alone would the Minister allow total depopulation where BSE is detected? Given the small number of herds nationally, about 20, which are leucosis-restricted at present, why not allow the same concession for trade reasons if not for veterinary reasons because it has a very serious effect on trade?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 23, 26, 29, 31, 39, 42, 50, 62 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The viability of rural areas &mdash; which depends on maintaining a sufficient number of holdings &mdash; and the need for effective land use are twin aims which must be reconciled in such a way that we will have both a cost-effective farm sector as a basis for our food industry and an adequate number of farm households to keep our rural areas viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Family farming will remain critically important for the viability of rural communities but in some areas may not be sufficient in itself to guarantee this viability.  These areas will rely increasingly on non-farm, or non-traditional farming, sources for their livelihood with the result that their incomes will be less <Col N="1325" /> dependent than now on land area or production volume.  As Deputies know, there are many national and Community schemes in operation in support of agriculture, some of which help to increase efficiency and effective land use while others aim at encouraging alternative income sources.  The Farm Improvement Programme aims to increase on farm efficiency.  In the case of policies aimed at achieving effective land use, it was agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and given effect in the budget that the operation of the installation aid would be made more flexible; also, the amount of lease income qualifying for income tax exemption was raised from £2,000 to £3,000 to encourage the transfer of land to young farmers.</P>
    <P>In the area of encouraging alternative income sources, the Operational Programme for Rural Development is now in operation.  This programme fits within the Community Support Framework 1989-1993, which sets out the allocation of the bulk of the enlarged EC Structural Funds which should provide substantial income and employment opportunities in the overall economy and in rural areas. Payments under the disadvantaged areas schemes are funded from the Community Support Framework.  In this regard, a recent important development was the decision agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that the increase and modulation of headage rates originally intended to apply in 1992 will be brought forward to 1991.  The full benefit of the revised headage scheme payments in respect of 1991 should, on this basis, be £100 million compared to £67 million previously.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 9 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The criteria for designating areas as disadvantaged would not allow for the submission of a proposal to have the whole country classified as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I presume the allegation the Deputy refers to is that of MEP Joe McCartin, subsequently referred to by Deputy Deasy in this House as &ldquo;Reports from Brussels&rdquo;.  The allegations are totally false and are calculated to undermine the application for extension and reclassification which will benefit an additional 18,000 farmers.  I also want to reject as false the linked allegation that I withdrew an application for extension which had been lodged by my predecessor.  The plain fact is no such application was ever made.</P>

This application went in last June, eight months ago, and why has it not been passed or rejected by the Commission?  All we heard were leaks to <Col N="1327" /> the Fianna Fáil Deputies in the months of July and August, but when the information was kicked around and people learned that they were not included in the submission they ran for cover.  Why has the submission taken so long and why did the Minister leak the whole matter to his own backbenchers?  The Minister and Commissioner MacSharry are becoming, respectively, Minister and Commissioner for Leaks at this stage and not for Agriculture and Food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the element that will be involved in the total extra payments, let me tell the Deputy, because he belongs to an area that is designated as severely disadvantaged. This is a tripod extension.  First, it includes new areas that have never been designated before; second, the reclassification of a whole range of areas from less severely disadvantaged to severely disadvantaged; and finally, increased headage payments in areas such as the Deputy represents that would not otherwise be affected by it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of record, one country has a 100 per cent rate &mdash; that is Luxembourg &mdash; and the historical reasons for that were introduced before the current regulations were put in place by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in the early seventies.  When that decision was made Luxembourg was classified as part of the Benelux countries &mdash; Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland &mdash; and that explains the anomaly; but the current regulation requires that you must have an average income below a certain amount of the national average and therefore it cannot be 100 per cent in any country.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is referring to what might be a category of what might be called &ldquo;super severely handicapped&rdquo;.  We have made major progress on three fronts.  Perhaps when we have all that in place we can also consider the point raised by the Deputy.

      <P>Bearing in mind that there are many areas in my constituency and in others that are unjustifiably excluded from the Minister's submission to Brussels, is there any mechanism open to them at present for reconsideration or do they have to wait until an appeals tribunal is set up?  Furthermore, will the appeals tribunal be open to all farmers who have not previously applied in view of the fact that the original scheme was not adequately advertised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points here.  The Deputy will appreciate that this is not a scheme in respect of individual farmers; it is a scheme for disadvantaged areas.  The disadvantaged area must be of a sufficient size and homogeneity to satisfy the criteria.  It is not just for individual farmers.  It is open to everybody to appeal.  When all this has been completed 72 per cent of the country will be classified as disadvantaged and 28 per cent will be excluded.  A line has to be drawn somewhere.  Even if 85 per cent of the country was designated as disadvantaged, 15 per cent, which incidentally, includes city areas, would say: &ldquo;We are outside the line&rdquo;.  We have done a huge job here.  Some, of course, will be at the wrong side of the line and will not be included in the disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>As part of the 1992 Single Market programme, the EC Commission proposes to harmonise standards for health, hygiene etc., both in relation to liquid milk for human consumption and to milk for the manufacture of dairy products. However, these are only draft proposal which are being technically examined at present, prior to their submission to the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>My approach to the negotiations on these measures will be to ensure that whatever standards are agreed are reasonable having regard to the need to guarantee top quality production.  In line with the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, a working group has recently been set up comprising of representatives of producers and processors to examine the implications of the proposals and to work on a submission which could be lodged for Community aid.  The Department have already approached the EC Commission for Community funds to be made available to assist Irish producers adapt to the standards required.</P>

If we were to go back to the early seventies before we joined the European Community and took upon ourselves and the back of the Irish taxpayers the obligation to support low income farm families it would be bad both from the point of view <Col N="1345" /> of the taxpayers and the low income farm families.  We are not about to denationalise the Common Agricultural Policy. The Deputy should reflect on what he has said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 80 together.  The information sought by <Col N="1346" /> Deputy Bell concerning the production levels of organic food is not available to my Department.  A sum of £350,000 was provided in the Estimates for my Department in both 1990 and 1991 for the development of organic farming for which a special unit was established in the Department.</P>
      <P>In addition, last year's allocation was used to support the following projects: (1) a research and development programme by Teagasc into specific organic farming practices most suitable to Irish conditions, (2) market research by CBF into the potential organic meat market in Europe, (3) the inclusion of new organic farming modules in UCD's and Teagasc's education and training courses, (4) establishment of SFADCo's Organic Development Centre for the Shannon region, (5) improvement of the structures and services of the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, and (6) production of a video on organic farming suitable for training and promotional purposes.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, a study of the needs of the Irish organic horticultural sector was undertaken by representatives of my Department and other interests.  The recommendations of the study are being implemented by the Department, An Bord Glas and the industry, as appropriate. An information leaflet on organic farming was prepared and is now available on request.  A number of projects for funding in the current year are now under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the information the Deputy requires but I think he knows from his close knowledge of the industry that organic produce is a relatively small percentage of the overall produce.  Most of the food we consume in this country is produced by conventional means.  Nonetheless the organic market is growing.  The primary reason for the <Col N="1347" /> provision of £450,000 in 1990 was to help establish the organic unit in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The structure is established there and we are working together with the Organic Growers' Association, Teagasc, the people in UCD and with CBF who are researching the market potential in Europe.  The work is at a relatively preliminary stage. Nonetheless the objectives are being set out to identify the extent of the market, to monitor growth in that market and to respond accordingly.</P>

      <Quest>with regard to the recent slaughter of almost 2,000 cattle which had been exposed to BSE, if he has any investigation ongoing or plans for such into the relationship of feeding practices, such as (a) grain and pellet as against grass feeding and (b) the incidence of BSE in recent reports from England which indicate the deficiency of essential fats in animals which are not allowed to graze sufficiently as grass has a high level of essential fatty acids necessary for brain cell development.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been 32 cases of BSE in Ireland since January 1989, and I assume the Deputy is referring to the animals in the herds which have been voluntarily depopulated for trading reasons even though they were not infected with BSE.  All the evidence available indicates that there is no indigenous source of BSE in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BSE is a relatively new disease of individual animals and there is no evidence of animal to animal transmission. I have put in place a very comprehensive series of control measures including the banning of the importation of bovine animals and of meat and bonemeal from the UK and the prohibition of <Col N="1349" /> the feeding of even domestically produced meat and bonemeal to ruminants.</P>
    <P>Research is continuing particularly in the UK as to its possible origin.  To date the accepted theory is that the inclusion of meat and bonemeal in ruminant rations has been a factor and for that reason I banned the feeding of ruminant material to ruminant animals.</P>
    <P>The theory advanced by a source in the UK that the substitution of animal protein for grass in feed has increased the vulnerability of bovines to diseases of the brain such as BSE has not gained general acceptability in scientific circles.</P>
    <P>While I do not intend to initiate any specific investigation into feeding practices here, I can assure the House that the outcome of the general on-going research into BSE will be considered in my Department's continuous evaluations of our protection measures.  I should also point out that even prior to the ban on the feeding of animal proteins to ruminants, their use here for that purpose was minimal. Natural grazing and silage has constituted 97 per cent of the traditional diet of the native herd.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the failure to control the spread of BSE in this country is extremely serious?  As recently as 12 February there was a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> about the confirmation of a case of BSE in Waterford.  When will this disease be eliminated?  Over the months the Minister has been saying that it is under control but it is continuing to spread.  What assurance have we got that BSE will be eliminated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The report the Deputy referred to was published as a consequence of the deliberate policy on my part and that of the Government to make all facts publicly available.  I do not want anybody to doubt that our status in this regard is absolutely free.  We do not have an indigenous problem.  In the period of almost two and a half years, out of a population of almost eight million cattle there have been 32 cases of BSE. The Deputy will have to recognise that <Col N="1350" /> that is not serious by any manner or means.  If we were talking of these numbers in other instances it would be regarded as a trickle, which is what it is.  Having regard to the nature of this disease, which is indigenous in other countries &mdash; I do not want to point a finger at those countries &mdash; the incubation period of which could be up to three years, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that his request for an assurance of an elimination of the disease is not a reasonable one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that meat and bonemeal are the source of BSE and have been identified as such in a neighbouring country.  Will the Minister outline any proposals in regard to examining the type of rendering plants now in use in this country as many of them are unable to meet the standards which were required 25 years ago?  BSE is a new disease which has been blamed on the rendering industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A long time ago I banned the importation of meat and bonemeal from outside Ireland.  In addition, even though we do not have an infected source at home I have also banned any feeding of meat and bonemeal from Ireland to ruminants, which means that ruminants will no longer be fed by ruminants.  The Deputy may rest assured that there is control in this regard.  I appreciate his concern because it is important to assure all markets of the actions we have taken.  Finally, I banned the importation of any bovine herds from outside Ireland, which is very different from the actions of some of our colleagues in the European Community, who seem to have miraculously escaped the consequences of what is happening in Britain, even though they had not banned the importation of herds which we banned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to say that, because of the status of our offal, our renderers are still exporting it to other countries who use it for feed.  We are not prepared to do this because our standards are the highest in Europe.  Most of it is being exported and I am told that the rendering industry is in a healthy and vigorous state.  If there is a need to incinerate some of it, although I have no evidence of that, I am sure it will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated before lunch that the Minister had made it clear that the workers would have no reason to be fearful for their future in relation to conditions, pensions and so on.  I agree with the Minister and the workers should accept his commitment in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>General Costello realised the value of the vegetable industry and the need to build it up.  When he was running the Sugar Company he set up a network of vegetable factories.  However, when he departed the scene there seemed to be a change in attitude by the new management and as time went on the vegetable factories throughout the country started to disappear.  These decisions were incorrect, especially in regard to the factories of which I have an intimate knowledge, in Midleton and Mallow.</P>
      <P>During those years, especially in the mid-eighties when Erin Foods ran the factories at Midleton and Mallow, I was able to get details of the management figures and it was clear that they were making money.  However, there was a certain element in management who decided that, to keep the Taj Mahal going in St. Stephen's Green, they needed money from somewhere and they decided to dispose of these factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then vegetable growing and processing have gone from strength to strength under new management in Midleton and Mallow.  It is obvious that whoever made the original decision to get rid of those factories has a lot to answer for.  There might have been a change of management on the board but the executive management is the same. If we do not have a strong board my fear is that if £200 million comes into their <Col N="1392" /> coffers they might go in the wrong direction. It is vitally important for the success of the Irish Sugar Company &mdash; Greenvale plc &mdash;that the £200 million or thereabouts which will come from the flotation will be utilised in an efficient and effective manner.  This funding is needed by the Sugar Company to develop because, as the consultants' report shows, if the Sugar Company stays where it is it will go backwards; and we know that they must go forward.</P>
    <P>In what industries are the company interested?  In how many food related industries have they become involved?  I I know they are involved in Odlums, but are they involved in any other food related industries?  This is very important because in a couple of years there will be a review of the sugar quotas, indeed already the sugar quota is under question. In order to ensure that there will be a beet crop with a decent price for our suppliers, it is incumbent on whoever will run the new company to ensure that there will be an outlet for the material produced. It is very important that the company should look at businesses which will take sugar as a source material.</P>
    <P>There should also be a formalised connection between Teagasc and the Sugar Company.  We know that there has been a shortage of funding in Teagasc over the last number of years and it is important that research and development are pursued as they need new markets and alternative products, the day has gone when we produce only for the commodity market.  It is now quite clear that we are wasting our time producing goods in bulk for which there is no market.  I believe therefore that there should be a connection between the Irish Sugar Company, who may establish subsidiaries, and a research and development body in this country because such a connection should lead to new markets being found for our sugar and produce.</P>
    <P>It appears from the information available to me that the major share of capital investment by Comhlacht Siúicre Eireann has been directed to their factory in Carlow.  I would like to know why more investment has not been directed <Col N="1393" /> to the factory at Mallow and I am wondering if this is a sinister development.  I ask the Minister therefore to carry out an investigation into the level of investment and type of equipment used at both the Carlow and Mallow plants.</P>
    <P>We also need to examine the question of labour relations.  If one wants an exemplary example of good labour relations all they need do is look to the workforce of the Mallow factory.  They have a very good relationship with management and this should lead one to the conclusion that the plant should remain open for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I have no philosophical hang-ups about the privatisation, partial or otherwise, of semi-State bodies.  Whether it be a semi-State body or a private company, it should be operated in an efficient and effective manner, give value for money and be judged only on the number of jobs saved or created.  The Workers' Party do not seem to worry about who pays the piper.  We should not forget that it is the worker who pays the taxes which are then put back into the semi-State companies. The Workers' Party seem to believe that money grows on trees, but any available resources should not be wasted.  In this context the Government want to see jobs maintained but not at the expense of the hard pressed taxpayer.  The success of this venture will ultimately depend on the wise use of the funding raised by management by way of the flotation of shares.  I wish Greenvale plc every success as their success or failure will have implications for thousands of people throughout the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I should say at the outset that if this Bill had been presented in the House in the mideighties Fianna Fáil Deputies, Ministers and their leader would not have been in favour of privatisation, partial or otherwise. The views of the Fianna Fáil Party in the eighties are well documented.  They were absolutely opposed to privatisation, partial or otherwise, of the Irish Sugar Company or of any other company in the <Col N="1394" /> semi-State sector.  However, they seemed to have changed their view in recent times, in particular since 1989.</P>
      <P>Prior to the election in 1987 the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil Ministers made it very clear that they were not looking for a mandate to enter into discussions on the privatisation of companies in the semi-State sector and that this matter was not on their agenda.  As I said, it seems that they have changed their view, in particular since this Coalition Government were formed, and it would appear, regardless of whether Fianna Fáil Ministers or Deputies are prepared to admit it, that the Progressive Democrats are setting the agenda.</P>
      <P>It has been well known for many years that the Progressive Democrats are strong exponents of privatisation and would like to see all semi-State companies privatised and sold off to the highest bidder as soon as possible.  Some compromise had to be reached between the two parties in Government and we have now been presented with the Sugar Bill, 1990, which attempts to strike a balance between the concerns of both parties.  I would submit that the Fianna Fáil Party would not be over-enthusiastic about the selling off of State assets; but the price of being in Government has to be met, which in this instance is a movement on the semi-State sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to dwell at length on the history of the Irish Sugar Company, since other speakers in this debate have done so, except to say that the Irish Sugar Company have made a major contribution to the economic life of this country and from their origin have been a major source of employment, particularly in those areas where their factories are located.  They have also been of importance to the farmers, growers and suppliers in those hinterlands and surrounding counties.  In more recent times, during the last ten years, the company have faced serious difficulties and hard decisions had to be made.  These were not easy decisions for any political party and the Fianna Fáil Party took a long time to face up to and come to grips with these decisions.  They also seemed <Col N="1395" /> to display a lack of appreciation of the serious difficulties which the rationalisation of the Irish Sugar Company presented in the eighties.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the review group set up by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food to consider the future of the Irish Sugar Company were charged with certain undertakings &mdash; to examine their activities and structure, the question of partial or full privatisation and the commercial development of the company with the State retaining a degree of control.  In one respect this debate goes beyond the Irish Sugar Company because I foresee us having many debates along these lines on other companies in the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>The question which needs to be asked is: who is going to control the assets of this company?  I am not sure whether the review group was given a free hand or whether the Government wanted the review group to inform them that the company should continue under the present structures, with all due respect to those consultants we bring in, they tend to recommend what they have been charged to recommend in the first instance.  The only reason this work was done is that the mood was in favour of privatisation of the Irish Sugar Company. The Minister for Agriculture and Food seems to be determined to do this.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company, as we know them, have one major asset and that is their sugar quota within the European Community.  I wonder if the 200,000 tonnes of EC sugar quota is of itself the main attraction.  Certainly in the past it has been regarded as a very attractive asset to companies both in Ireland and abroad and over the last number of years other companies have shown an interest in getting their hands on this quota.  I wonder how much interest there is in developing the Sugar Company other than people getting their hands on this quota which obviously is of extreme value and its value will be enhanced over the coming years.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the course the <Col N="1396" /> Government are going to pursue in privatisation. If changes have to be made I wonder if the question of the State retaining a majority shareholding was considered.  Perhaps when the Minister comes to conclude he will outline to the House the weaknesses in the concept of the State retaining at least a 51 per cent share and if this has been considered.  I feel it would have been a major bonus to the Government and the future of the Sugar Company if the State had retained a 51 per cent share in the company.  The company have a major role to play in the commercial life of this country in relation to the asset, the EC sugar quota, and I would like to feel that guarantees will be given by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his colleagues in relation to the future.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in the preservation of jobs.  The Sugar Company have been a very solid employer down through the years, having four centres now reduced to two.  From what we have heard in this debate so far I could not be satisfied with the employment guarantees, which seem to be sadly lacking. The references to workers' rights in the context of the new company are indeed minimal in this debate so far on the Government's side as is the whole question of security of employment.</P>
    <P>On the question of the amount of shares the Government want to hold on to, on Committee Stage we will be urging the Minister and trying to convince the Government and the Fine Gael Party, who seem to be accepting this Bill, that the State should retain a majority shareholding in this company.  Given the history of the company and the importance of what is in effect a national asset, I do not believe it is in the best interests of the workers or, indeed, of the taxpayer that we concede majority shareholding in this company to the private sector.  I am afraid my experience in dealing with the private sector and public assets has not exactly been what would give one much confidence in the private sector.  The private sector has a far narrower motivation than we would expect to see in the commercial semi-State bodies.  I am <Col N="1397" /> afraid their decisions are made strictly on the basis of the rate of return, and if the rate of return is not what they are looking for then they will pass on to the next industry which is ready for stripping and rationalisation.  I am not convinced from what the Minister has been saying that he is taking adequate precautions to ensure that in the new arrangement adequate measures are going to be taken to build up this company and give them a chance and an opportunity of expanding.  The Sugar Company should be able to expand if they wish to move into new areas.  They have a solid base and they are in a healthy financial situation after many difficult decisions were made over the last number of years.  The guarantees are lacking in the Minister's contribution and I do not see adequate emphasis being placed on employment, future employment, security of employment and terms of employment for the present employees.</P>
    <P>I am aware some meetings have taken place since the Bill was introduced and I urge the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his colleagues that full consultation should take place with the workforce and with their representatives in the union prior to the implementation of this Bill.  At the end of the day the Sugar Company are going to be as good as the performance of their workforce and it is extremely important that the workforce, the union leadership and the ICTU are fully supportive of the new moves which are being recommended by the Government and which, given the numbers within this House, will be cleared by this House and voted upon by the Government and the Fine Gael Party.  These are matters on which we can seek to influence the Minister, on Committee Stage, when I think he has said he is prepared to look at these questions.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the introduction of privatisation in the semi-State sector which fascinates me is the whole attitude being taken by the management of these companies. I like to feel there was a time when the senior management of public utilities and of the semi-State commercial bodies were proud to be working in the public sector, but I must question that in <Col N="1398" /> the present context.  There seems to be a mad rush by public sector managers to get themselves into the private sector.  I wonder if this rush is motivated by self interest or the interest of the companies. I have heard no convincing arguments from them why they must be privatised. We have heard of the restrictions in terms of management salaries by virtue of the Devlin report and other restrictions, but I wonder if these people are all that good. They feel they can make enormous salaries in the private sector; why then are they not going to the private sector?  The ethos which was in the Sugar Company in the old days when people were proud to manage public sector semi-State bodies is sadly lacking in the managers we have in the eighties and nineties.  This needs to be addressed.  Also I do not consider it to be anything like sufficient argument that the remuneration of managers is so restrictive in the public sector that these companies have to be privatised to allow these people to be rewarded in the manner to which they feel they are entitled.  There are simpler ways of doing that without changing the whole context and concept of the semi-State commercial bodies.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the ICTU and the Government have had discussions about this whole group and the Central Review Committee are due to have a further look at the role and contribution the State companies can have in job creation.  I find it difficult to understand why we are moving ahead on one aspect of privatisation while the review committee are looking at the possibility of further job creation in the State sector.  Can the Minister inform the House what the prospects are in terms of job creation in the new company which will be set up?  Are we going to see what we have seen all too often, even in recent days, that when the private sector take over State companies or in privatised State companies, the first thing, with or without Government consultation, is rationalisation?  Jobs have to go and it seems the easy option is to bring about massive redundancies.  I wonder if that is going to be the first bit of bad news we will get when this Bill <Col N="1399" /> goes through the House.  If the Minister is confident that he is doing the right thing, that what he is doing holds out the best prospects for the development of the sugar industry, then he should spell out in detail from his discussions with the management of this company guarantees in relation to employment.  At the end of the day if we cannot guarantee employment then we are setting out and accepting that there is failure from the word go.</P>
    <P>Obviously jobs will be extremely important, as all of us who have been involved in their creation over the years are aware, trying to attract industry here. When we have our own industry, a valuable asset, which cannot be taken out of our hands at this stage, we should be ensuring that the Sugar Company are in a position to expand, that the jobs existing are secure and that others can be provided.  I have not heard convincing arguments from the management of the company, the Minister or his colleagues in relation to those aspects of the proposal.</P>
    <P>The option which I do not believe received any consideration by the group was that of increasing investment, or looking at the company in its public state and putting investment into the Sugar Company.  One of the serious difficulties, the commercial semi-State sector has encountered in recent years has been the lack of investment capital.  From my recollection the Government did not appear to consider this as an option.  We have to assess the basis of the Telesis report and the necessity for having stand-alone, strong, independent companies capable of competing not just here but also within the European context.  Surely the question of a capital injection into the Sugar Company should have received far more consideration than the mere scant references to it in the course of this debate? In summing up I would hope the Minister would let us have some details of whether that question was considered: what sort of capital investment would be required to put the Sugar Company on the requisite footing within the context of the European markets.  That possibility for <Col N="1400" /> the future of the company does not appear to have been dealt with in any great detail.</P>
    <P>In replying I should also like the Minister or his colleagues to address the whole question of the opportunities that will exist for the new company.  For example, will we see the Sugar Company continue to operate, as it has been, in relatively restricted markets or will we see the company, under its new management and structures, looking further afield endeavouring to penetrate new markets?  I should like to have some clarification from the Minister of what we can expect in that context.</P>
    <P>I wonder just how much preparation and thinking the Fianna Fáil Party have done in relation to the part privatisation &mdash; which is what is happening &mdash; because it is not too long since the Taoiseach in this House was saying that he would regard any privatisation, part or otherwise, of any company in the semi-State sector as being a dismantling of the State sector.  At that time the Taoiseach seemed to think that any suggestion of privatisation was something that was being waved by what he described as the new Right.  Therefore, I wonder how the Taoiseach can come into this House now and reconcile his statements of the mid-eighties, to the effect that Fianna Fáil would take no hand, act or part in dismantling the semi-State sector since he said at that time he felt it would be the same as dismantling the State.  There appears to have been a major change of heart on the part of the Government in relation to the commercial semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>From their most recent trading results the Sugar Company appear to have got their act together in recent years in relation to their commercial activity.  It is rather ironic that it is at this time the Government are considering floating the Sugar Company in the private markets, when the company are in a healthy position and consistently made a profit in 1988, 1989 and 1990.  From my understanding of the balance sheet of the Sugar Company it appears to be in a healthy state, in a position to remain healthy. <Col N="1401" /> Therefore I wonder why the Government have to consider the proposals enshrined in this Bill at this time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not been very specific or clear in the House with regard to what will happen to the funds raised in the context of shares in this company being sold.  We have to question what is going to happen.  I would like the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his colleagues to put on the record of this House exactly what the Government intend doing with the revenue realised in the course of this financial year from the sale of the assets of this company.  Obviously there is a number of options open to them.  For example, will the revenue to be realised be used to reduce the national debt which was part and parcel of the original debate offered by the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats as part of the reasoning for selling off State assets?  In the context of the 1991 budget there appears to be a gap in the Government's revenue-raising potential somewhere in the region of £200 million to £300 million particularly in the context of a downward trend in economic growth.  One must question whether the revenues raised from the sale of the Sugar Company and of Irish Life will be used to bridge that gap.  As the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Finance have gone around the country saying that any funds raised from these sales would be used to reduce the national debt, then we should have that tied down in the context of this debate because the statements to date have not been very convincing in relation to that aspect.  Certainly I would wish that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, when replying, would clarify just exactly what will be done in this respect.</P>
    <P>My strong objection to this process is the fact that the State, the many workers who have given their lives to the Sugar Company down through the years, at the end of the day, will lose out by virtue of the fact that the State is not retaining majority control.  I would suggest that having 45 per cent control of this company is having no control at all; either one has 51 per cent control &mdash; when one can take decisions at management level <Col N="1402" />&mdash; or, in effect, one has ceded any control over this company.  For example, I contend that 49 per cent is as good as 10 per cent, 20 per cent or whatever but, effectively, the State is giving away control of a very important asset, what has been an asset since the foundation of the State, indeed what has been a very important part of life in this country in the various provinces.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I would appeal to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and Finance and the Government to reconsider the amount of control they are ceding in this company.  Were they to come back into this House and put forward the possibility of retaining, say, 51 per cent of this company, there might be some scope for examining this proposition in a different light.  I am worried also in the context of what will follow, not just the Sugar Bill &mdash; we know what is the position <i>vis-á-vis</i> Irish Life &mdash; but in the various other areas where the Government, if the mood strikes them, will attempt to privatise as well.  I am particularly worried that the Government have conceded that the Fianna Fáil Party, who over the years have had a strong commitment to the commercial semi-State bodies &mdash; who fought for them and their activities in Bord na Móna, Aer Lingus and the ESB down through the years &mdash; seem to be sadly lacking in that commitment as we go into the nineties.  I have not seen the argument advanced or concrete proposals put forward in relation to this change of heart on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Given the importance of the commercial semi-State sector, perhaps it is time the Taoiseach explained to his own party and to the House what has given him reason to change his mind in relation to statements which he made consistently throughout the eighties when any mention of privatisation was made.  The Taoiseach made sound, firm commitments to Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, CIE and indeed to all the commercial semi-State bodies down through the years.  In the eighties the Taoiseach could not conceive privatisation either as a concept, as an economic possibility, or as an instrument <Col N="1403" /> of economic policy by any Government at any stage in Irish commercial life.  I have not been able to follow from the Taoiseach's various statements when he had this Pauline conversion or when the bolt struck in relation to changing Fianna Fáil policy on commercial semi-State bodies.  I am not at all convinced that what we are doing is in the best interests of the Sugar Company, of the workers or of the growers because the rules of the game will change considerably.  I wonder in the context of the profits being made by the Sugar Company in recent years if it is in anybody's interests that the rules should change at this stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of control, I wonder why we have not sought to learn from the experience of the Nordic countries in relation to the activities of the commercial semi-State sector.  The interaction between the commercial state sector and the private sector in the Nordic countries seems to be remarkably successful in terms of natural resources, in the oil industry, in forestry and so on. They seem to have struck the correct balance.  One must accept that decisions have to be based on economic efficiency. Not anybody wishes to stand over inefficiencies, lack of competition or lack of energy in the context of producing the results in the semi-State sector.  The semi-State sector must stand on its own feet and compete and should be better than the private sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the balance which should be struck, where the Government are determined to partially privatise an industry like the sugar industry, the Government are seriously erring in relation to ceding the majority control in the context of the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister for Agriculture and Food would outline to the House the advice now available to the Government in relation to privatisation. Obviously, consultants and stockbrokers have to be involved; but I would like to know that the Minister is entirely satisfied that the advisers in this instance are independent. Needless to say, different <Col N="1404" /> interests have to be protected.  There is the Government interest, the Sugar Company interest and private sector interests.  I would like some more detail in relation to the actual stock market flotation on the Stock Exchange in the context of the advice available to the Government.  I am particularly concerned that the advice available to the Government should be independent.  As the advice is presently structured there seems to be a lack of independence in relation to the companies involved.  Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture and Food will take the opportunity when he returns to the House to outline to us in detail how the flotation will take place, what advice is available to him and the Government in relation to the disposition of the shares and who will make the decisions at the end of the day in relation to the price of the shares.</P>
    <P>I would also like an indication from the Minister as to where the money will go. Will the money be allowed back into central funds to be disposed of as the order of the day in the current side?  There is no doubt from the way the budget was presented, and is being dismantled on a daily basis, that the Government will be looking for any cash they can get their hands on.  There will certainly be a lack of buoyancy.</P>
    <P>More questions were asked in the Minister's contribution than were answered. The review group who reported to the Government in relation to the future of the company did not consider with an open mind the three options they were given to consider.  Obviously, there is a strong opinion in the private sector and in the world of management consultants that privatisation is the order of the day in relation to commercial activity here. From what we have seen of privatisation across the water I am not convinced of its success.  I am extremely worried about the Government ceding control of a company which has a proud record in its contribution to the economy both at local and national level.  In the future we will <Col N="1405" /> not have that control.  Perhaps we can use as a precedent the recent example where the Minister for Telecommunications came into the House last Thursday saying he had no involvement with a semi-State commercial company and that it was not up to him to give them any directives or to tell them how to implement their rationalisation programme; but within ten days he could give them very strong advice.  I suspect that the Minister for Agriculture and Food may well find that when the management of the new company is <i>in situ</i> he will be reminded very quickly that he has a 45 per cent interest in the company which does not entitle him to either give directions or voice his concern if the company should approach their commercial activities in a way which does not meet the wishes of the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about this as this industry is very important to this country.</P>
    <P>I have the same reservations about public utilities.  Is it in our interests to privatise these companies?  The attempted privatisation of the Dublin Gas Company makes me very sceptical of the motivation of the private sector and private investors.  They wanted the State to put up all the money and to take all the risk, and they wanted all the profit.  That is a very narrow economic proposition.  I hope it will not be the sort of proposition we will be confronted with in the context of the privatisation of the Sugar Company. I hope the Government will reconsider.</P>
    <P>This is all happening very quickly.  I am not sure that this has received the amount of thought and consideration that it warrants. There are many other companies watching, companies perhaps in the same situation.  This requires far greater consideration than we have had to date.  In that context my main objective to what is before this House is the fact that the Government, who are custodians of the Sugar Company on behalf of all the people, are not acting in the best interests <Col N="1406" /> of the workers, the suppliers or the taxpayers generally, who have contributed to the Sugar Company down through the years by giving over majority control in this company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important legislation.  This is the first Bill we have seen in relation to the part-privatisation of a semi-State body.  I compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Food on being the first Minister to introduce such legislation.  In spite of what Deputy Spring has been saying about Fianna Fáil's views in the past, something tells me he has a sneaking admiration for this legislation.  In the early eighties when he was in Government I think he may have been considering something like it.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why people, including politicians, have a dread or fear of privatisation and going to the market for money.  It gives every citizen the right to purchase equity in the new body.  Privatisation has been a success in Britain and parts of the Continent.  Since it was introduced as a new concept 12 or 13 years ago in Britain many of the privatised companies have enjoyed outstanding profitability and success.  I am firmly convinced that we should have more partial or full privatisation of our semi-State sector if it is to be successful and if we want to see growth in that area. Greenvale plc will become a major player in the food business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not say much about Dairygold when it was mooted.  He was mute at the meeting on Monday.  It is a capital intensive industry and I believe the necessary capital will now become available.  Workers and management have made a significant contribution to the Irish sugar industry and allowing them to take a share is a step in the right direction.  I understand there is to be 10 per cent for growers and 5 per <Col N="1407" /> cent for workers, a total of 15 per cent of the amount being allocated.</P>
      <P>Growers of sugar beet have been involved in a very profitable enterprise during the past few years.  Hard work is involved.  There can be a late spring or a bad winter, causing difficulties for farmers and for the workers in the industry. Late spring can have a retarding effect on a crop which must be high yielding if it is to be profitable.  Bad weather can lead to expensive spraying with herbicides and pesticides.  There can also be problems in very dry years.  It is a vital crop in the rotation system.</P>
      <P>We have the distinction of having disease free sugar beet.  We do not have the worry of the new disease which is in the United Kingdom.  There are also problems on the Continent which we do not have.  I hope we can long have a protected industry so that there will be success for the company, the farmers and the workers at all levels.</P>
      <P>On the grower's side a quarter of the capital must be attributed to ghost sugar. This is sugar extracted but not paid for by the industry.  An inquiry last year showed that a total of £5 million was involved, which is nearly 25 per cent of the profit of the company.  The company should acknowledge this through some bonus to the beet growers.  They should be given some part of the shareholding.  That would be one way of ensuring that the sugar industry would be protected.  This could be done with the growers or jointly with the growers and the company.  The fact that growers have an ownership stake in the quotas could lead to undesirable practices.  That is a cause for concern.</P>
      <P>There has been an excellent relationship between the farmers and the company throughout the years.  There have often been negotiations on prices and conditions but they have always been successfully concluded.  Growers and management must be given the credit for solving their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sugar quota is approximately <Col N="1408" /> 200,000 tonnes-180,000 tonnes of A quota sugar and 20,000 tonnes of B quota sugar.  I am glad that the Irish consumer and the Irish market have at all times been committed to the purchase of irish sugar.  From time to time there have been small importations which have always been quickly brought to an end by the efforts of the company in adjusting the pricing structure.  There is the danger that the multiples in the grocery business have been putting our food industry under greater threat than any other group.  They have not been helpful to the Irish food industry and have been encouraging the importation of foodstuffs, attempting at times to purchase foreign sugar.</P>
    <P>Given the share capital of the company to be floated on the stockmarket, is it possible that the bid for the shares would be so attractive that our citizens would be prepared to sell their shares?  I cannot see anything to stop it.  It is the only weakness I can see.  I should like Greenvale plc to stay in Irish ownership.  The public will own 55 per cent of the capital and 45 per cent will be retained by the Government.  There is nothing to stop any Government at a future date shedding a further percentage of their holding. Governments are always short of money and these shares will command a premium price.  I believe that the 45 per cent share will be whittled away over the years until 100 per cent is owned by purchasers in the market.</P>
    <P>The shares should be available at a concessionary price to farmers and workers who have made a significant contribution to this company over the years. I suggest a discount of 20 per cent or 25 per cent on the floated price.  Both sectors have given of their best in the past.</P>
    <P>The development of the industry has been greatly retarded by the lack of capital and the stop-go policy of successive Governments.  This led to heavy borrowings. Privatisation gives the company a wonderful opportunity for expansion. For example, the purchase of Minch Norton from Food Industries has been <Col N="1409" /> mooted.  This would bring the company into the lucrative malting barley industry. I understand the capital of the company is in the region of £66 million.  In the last few years they invested profits of about £50 million to modernise Mallow and Carlow.  In that time as well they had purchased a 50 per cent stake in Odlums and also got involved in the fertilizer business.  The money now being invested by the company is coming from accumulated profits and that is the way a successful business should operate.  That has been brought about by prudent management and sound financial judgment.</P>
    <P>The support of the growers is vital to the success of the company.  We must face such issues as the GATT and the CAP, and problems in the Gulf could be added to that.  There is also the threat of a 3 to 5 per cent cut in sugar price.  All these leave us in a state of uncertainty. Side by side with the growers and the workers are the investors, and profit is necessary to the confidence of investors if they are to continue to invest in the company.  High levels of profit are therefore essential.</P>
    <P>The other area that gives me cause for concern is the grower structure.  We have a total of 5,000 growers who grow from 100 tonnes to 1,000 tonnes per grower. An average grower has about 300 tonnes of sugar beet.  Conacre land is about one-third of the 80,000 acres of sugar beet grown.  Twenty-six thousand acres approximately is conacre land.  I am firmly convinced that the company is too dependent on conacre for the growing of sugar beet and, should any change take place in land ownership or structure, it would have a very serious effect on the acreage.</P>
    <P>The total tonnage of sugar beet produced is about 1.4 million tonnes.  Many sectors of our society are making quite lucrative livings from involvement in the sugar industry.  We have hauliers, shops, pubs and petrol stations in all the rural villages.  At a time when we are talking <Col N="1410" /> so much about downgrading rural villages the sugar industry is making a major contribution to our villages and small towns.  It is a very powerful local industry with a large spin-off of contractors, machinery manufacturers, hardware stores, etc. in our towns.  Iarnród Éireann has over the years given the farmers and the company an excellent service transporting sugar beet by rail, and rail is the most efficient transport system we have.</P>
    <P>On a more local note, I want to say that the sugar company in Mallow, which is in my constituency, has been the flagship of the Irish sugar industry with an excellent management and workforce and a good grower relationship.  It is an excellent employer in the town and the rural areas around it.  Its contribution to Mallow town has been significant.  The growth of the town since the day de Valera opened that factory many moons ago has been very significant.  It has been a town of major growth in the north Cork and Munster area.  Its economic contribution to the town has been very significant. It is a major employer with many spin-offs that are not recognised.  It has a very modern plant.  I heard someone mention investment in Carlow.  I have great confidence that the management of the Sugar Company will have an evenhanded approach to expenditure and capital development in both factories and that, as Mallow is well sited in a very prosperous beet growing area, it will get a fair contribution for capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The by-products of the sugar industry and the beet crop are very important to farming.  Beet comes on harvest at the off season of the year when many of its by-products can be used by the farming community. There is dried pulp, molasses pulp and Greenvale beets, all excellent. There is the factory lime which is available at very low cost and is an important source of trace elements which are important for the soil because of our intensive farming enterprises.</P>
    <P>A key player in the food industry, the <Col N="1411" /> Sugar Company have already diversified into flour and fertiliser.  There are greater opportunities for this company.  Its turnover is estimated to be in the region of £71 million with 1,700 employees.  We hear much talk about mergers and rationalisation. Any industry that can stay efficient has a major role to play and will survive the stiffest of competition.</P>
    <P>I have no fear for 1992.  Some people are so nervous of 1992 that many rash decisions are being taken which are not in the best interests of the industries and the people who work in them.  I would sound a word of caution.  These changes may not be necessary.  If we are efficient &mdash; and small is always more efficient than big &mdash; we will survive.</P>
    <P>The major area for concern is the area of marketing.  After 14 years membership of the EC we are still dependent on intervention and that leaves questions to be answered.  It is area I hope to address further in this Chamber.</P>

      <P>We in the Labour Party are opposed to this Bill.  It goes much further than the Sugar Company.  It has implications for all our public commercial enterprises.  There is an urgent need for a major debate in this House and out in the country about the future of our public enterprises for the remainder of the nineties and into the next century.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatsoever that Fianna Fáil have changed their policies in this area and are not prepared to discuss in an open way the merits of our public enterprises.  That is why we are using this opportunity to discuss the wider aspect of the role of our public enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public enterprises have made a major contribution to the economic and social development of our country over the years.  Today the very notion of public enterprises as a viable economic instrument is under attack.  Attempts by vested interests to discredit individual public <Col N="1412" /> enterprises, and therefore the idea of public enterprises are part of a campaign to prepare the groundwork for selective privatisations and are also against the whole principle of the notion of expansion in these areas.  It is against this background that I charge this Coalition Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, particularly the Fianna Fáil element therein, with sabotaging our commercial enterprises.  That is why I ask them to open up this debate once and for all to allow the people to put forward their views on it.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Debt Collection by Health Boards.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to highlight one of the most callous and cold actions that I have ever experienced in my 12 years as a public representative, that is the use of debt collection agencies by the Southern Health Board to intimidate, frighten and harass medical card holders, many of whom are in their sixties and some receiving psychiatric treatment on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board are employing a firm called Dun and Bradstreet International, who are the publishers of Stubbs Gazette to collect money from the elderly, and I have a copy of one of their demands with me here.  Intimidation is being used because the letter threatens court action if the money is not paid within 14 days.  The recipients, some of whom are medical card holders, people in their sixties who have had psychiatric treatment, are being intimidated by the highlighting of the Stubbs Gazette letterhead on the letter which is threatening legal action and is signed by a lady called Charlotte Keely, account manager of Stubbs Receivable Management Services Division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the cases brought to my attention was the case of a man in his sixties who got a demand for £228 for psychiatric treatment received by his wife at St. Stephen's Hospital, Cork, on a number of <Col N="1413" /> occasions over the past two years.  The demand letter signed by the accounts manager of Stubbs warns of legal action within 14 days if payment is not made during that time.  I submit there is no conceivable way by which these people can pay that money in that time.  They are being frightened literally out of their wits by the mention of Stubbs Gazette. The money is being demanded because the patient, who is a medical card holder, spent more than 30 days in hospital in recent years.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Southern Health Board I am deeply aware of the serious financial situation in which the board find themselves.  They have a shortfall of £4.5 million this year alone together with a deficit from last year of £1.5 million and they are in dire financial straits.  To descend so low as to intimidate the most vulnerable in our society is a despicable method of collecting money.  I believe that on two counts it is immoral to send letters like this to elderly people.  First the fear element: it frightens old people who are the most vulnerable in our society and whom we are supposed to be taking care of, certainly we give the most lip service to their care.  Second, I would question the justification of using these methods to intimidate medical card holders when the health board are owed a lot of money by more powerful groups in society.  I believe the health board are descending to very low standards by using this method to collect money from the most vulnerable in our society, and I ask the Minister of State this evening to assure the Dáil that he will stop this despicable practice.  Will he confirm to this House also that medical card holders who have full eligibility for hospital services are not obliged to pay these charges, and that he will make his views known, in no uncertain terms, to the Southern Health Board to ensure that medical card holders are exempt from these charges, especially elderly medical card holders who are suffering because they are psychiatric patients?</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to stop the intimidation of medical card holders, the elderly and psychiatric patients and I <Col N="1414" /> submit that the case to which I referred this evening is not just an isolated case. It is happening &mdash; and I can only speak for the Southern Health Board &mdash; because the health boards are using Dun and Bradstreet and another company, Hughes and MacEvilly to issue legal notices for some of the other hospitals under their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, under the Health Act, 1970, and certainly under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, the people I have described are entitled to treatment without this type of intimidation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Deputy that income from hospital charges is estimated at £13.5 million in the current year and is a significant factor in the funding of health board and voluntary hospitals.  A fundamental principle of hospital charges is that they are levied only upon those with ability to pay and those who cannot afford to pay them are not asked to do so.  Medical card holders and their dependants are exempted from the payment of hospital charges as well as certain other special categories, including women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks and children referred for treatment from a child health clinic or a school health examination.  In addition there is the added safeguard that a chief executive officer of a health board can grant exemption to an individual on hardship grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of debt collecting agencies is a recognised and legitimate means of endeavouring to secure payment of difficult debts.  Their use by health boards to secure payment of properly due hospital charges, when all other measures of recovery have failed, is justifiable on the grounds that a loss in revenue income from the charges can result in a lowering in the level and quality of the hospital services that can be made available.  Also, <Col N="1415" /> those who fail to pay properly due hospital charges can be perceived as placing an additional burden on those who do.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board use a firm of debt collectors in respect of bills for four Cork city hospitals.  The service provided consists entirely of a series of letters issued at regular intervals.  It does not involve anybody calling on the board's debtors.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that Deputy Allen refers to the fact that this particular case is a medical card holder because, of course, medical card holders are exempt from such charges.  Therefore I would be pleased if Deputy Allen would provide me with specific details of the individual case concerned and my Department will arrange to have it fully examined.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Designation of Slieve Bloom Mountain Area.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that I have been given the opportunity to present my case to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food as to a proposal that is on his desk to have the Slieve Bloom mountain area designated as an environmentally sensitive area under EC Regulation 797/85.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the area covering an expanse of land in north-east County Laois and south-east County Offaly &mdash; an area that has suffered somewhat over the past number of years as we see the continuous neglect of rural areas. I would draw the Minister's attention to a survey undertaken by Teagasc in that region which shows that only 3 per cent of the agricultural land is used for tillage purposes and that the remaining 97 per cent of land is grass, forestry or mountain grazing.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the population of the area which has been dwindling over the past quarter of a century.  It is an area that <Col N="1416" /> now has just 4,000 people, many of whom are rearing young families with a view to remaining on the land.  I put a simple stark fact before the Minister to underline the need for the Government to use the European benefits available to them in order to keep the lifeblood in the rural community.  It is this: the Glendine valley in the Slieve Bloom mountains, on the borders of County Laois and County Offaly, does not have one person residing in its entire area and that is in stark contrast to the situation of 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>When one hears Government Ministers speak in glowing terms of integrated rural development and projects to ensure the viability of rural areas, of protection of the family farm and the protection of people within rural areas, these statements become mere jargon unless we can apply them to specific areas in rural communities.  I submit to the Minister of State that there is no more suitable area for designation under the terms and conditions of this EC regulation than the Slieve Bloom mountain area.  This is an area that has already been recognised for its environmental assets by virtue of being designated an environmental park in 1975 by the Coalition led administration of the day.  It was hoped that progress along conforming with environmentally sensitive criteria would have been made since then.  Unfortunately, that has not happened.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that we are one of the few countries in the European Community that does not have one acre of its land declared an ESA under this scheme.  In Northern Ireland I understand there are two areas that have been designated, one in north County Down and one in the Glens of Antrim.  It is important that the Government ensure that we use the benefits available to us under the European Community regime. I hope that consideration will be given to the areas which are most suitable for designation.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on an area he considers more <Col N="1417" /> suitable than the Slieve Bloom area, but I do not think a more suitable one exists.</P>
    <P>It is important that we look at agriculture in conjunction with tourism.  I will not speak in terms of GATT or CAP or any of the attacks that are being made on rural areas.  I will not mention anything about the withdrawal of services &mdash; for example, post offices, Garda stations, schools or anything of that nature.  We all agree that there is an attack on rural communities and we should look to the benefits available under the type of scheme about which I am speaking.</P>
    <P>It is important that we commit ourselves to the preservation of the rural way of life, both in relation to tourism and in conjunction with what remains of agriculture. I draw the Minister's specific attention to the flora and fauna and the natural beauty of the Slieve Bloom mountain area which is unspoilt, unpolluted, very accessible &mdash; a mere 50 miles from Dublin &mdash; and adjacent to the main arterial transport routes.  Designation would ensure the future viability of this area.  I ask the Minister to commit himself to a submission for appropriate designation prior to the end of 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to respond to Deputy Flanagan's motion on the Adjournment.  The environmentally sensitive areas scheme is an EC supported scheme which has as its objective the introduction or maintenance of farming practices which protect and enhance the country side and natural resources, including wildlife habitats.  Under the scheme farmers enter into management agreements for at least five years under which they undertake to farm in such a way as will lead to the preservation of the environment and the countryside in general.  In return they are paid a premium per hectare, the level of which depends on the conditions they are asked to meet and the costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1990 Budget a provision of <Col N="1418" /> £100,000 was made to enable a pilot project to be set up in Ireland in order to gain some experience before extending the scheme to a wider area of the country. The scheme was seen by the Government as a very positive mechanism for contributing to the protection of the environment and at the same time compensating farmers who were suffering income losses as a result of cutbacks in production.  Accordingly, I immediately set up an inter-departmental committee, with representatives from my own Department, the Department of the Environment and the wildlife and forestry services, with a view to making recommendations on the type of areas which might be suitable for designation as ESAs.  The Slieve Bloom area was among a number of areas which were examined by the committee and they reported to me on the whole issue late last year.  I have now studied the report and hope to be able to make an announcement very shortly on the pilot project I have in mind to get the scheme in operation.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot give any more specific details until I am in a position to make a formal announcement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have been quite happy to have waited until the Minister could arrive.  I am sure there must be very good reasons he is not able to get here.  It is unfortunate that he is not in the House to respond to the points I wish to make in relation to the current situation.  First of all nothing I have said in the past, or indeed that I will say today, can in any way to be taken to mean that I have anything but the utmost contempt for Saddam Hussein and the misery he has managed to inflict upon his people. Indeed, his latest reported statement on Iraqi television indicates a level of unreality about his situation which borders on the incredible.</P>
      <P>It is clear, however, that the Iraqi Government have now accepted for the first time publicly that they must withdraw from Kuwait.  There can be no further excuse therefore for continuing with the appalling slaughter of Iraqi civilians by allied bombers.  Now is the time to stop the slaughter and to begin serious talks about structures for a lasting peace in the region.</P>
      <P>The US led war against Iraq was alledgedly undertaken on behalf of the United Nations and, in particular, under Resolution 678.  I doubt that there is anyone who believes this lie any longer. No UN military or political personnel are in any way involved in the planning or conduct of this war.  The Secretary General of the United Nations, Perez de Cuellar, has said that the war coalition has more than exceeded the terms of Resolution 678.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is deep concern at the mounting toll of civilian casualities.  It seems to me that the US led forces have inflicted death and destruction on the innocent Iraqi people as part of their war strategy.  We do not know the full extent of the deaths and injuries among the civilian population, with estimates varying from <Col N="1420" /> between 20,000 to 100,000 dead and injured.  Of course, we were all appalled at the television pictures of the bodies of women and children being taken from the destroyed air raid shelter in Baghdad last week.  Yet every day the sophisticated weaponry of the US-led forces rains down on the towns and cities of Iraq, tens of thousands of bombs which destroy not only military installations but also the water supplies, sewerage works, electricity supplies, footbridges and roads.  At this point, life for the civilian population of Iraq is sheer hell.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to a report in <i>The International Guardian</i> of Tuesday, 19 February, the day before yesterday, by Alfonso Rojo, a correspondent for the Madrid newspaper <i>El Mundo</i>, in which he states:</P>
    <P>Every day without being struck by bombs or buried under rubble, more than 50 children die in Baghdad alone, it is claimed here.  They fall victims to a silent assassin &mdash; the lack of electricity.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They die from what is technically known as cold injury&rdquo;, according to Dr. Kohosha Aboona, head of maternity care at the al-Aluia hospital. &ldquo;Every day, mothers come along with their children and when you touch them they're frozen.  It's like putting your hand in a refrigerator.  We try to revive them with hot water bottles, but sometimes it isn't enough.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The doctor, an Assyrian Christian, added that the problem was made worse by the lack of power to run incubators.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You can't keep a hospital going without electricity&rdquo;, she said.  &ldquo;In the big hospitals, they've had to suspend the treatment of patients with cancer, and much of the kidney dialysis and transplanting.  We've got a generator here but it only works for three hours a day&rdquo;.  The report continues along those lines.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the United Nations agreed that the civilians of Iraq or Kuwait <Col N="1421" /> should be the pawns in a power game between the West and the Middle East. As I have said, bombs are being dropped every day.  Indeed, the number of bombs was intensified over the past week as soon as the current peace initiative got underway.</P>
    <P>As a civilised nation, we cannot accept a war which is being carried out on our behalf which is killing children, preventing hospitals from treating cancer patients and causing the spread of disease through lack of water and death through hypothermia.  It is a total travesty that the civilian population is being attacked and killed in this way.  This is not consistent with the UN Charter or UN Resolution 678.</P>
    <P>The current Soviet-Iranian peace initiative seems to have been rejected with indecent haste.  As Archbishop Cathal Daly pointed out on Sunday, 17 February, the dismissal was precipitate and too sweeping.  Indeed, there was almost an expression of horror and disgust in London and Washington that anyone should dare to attempt to put a peace package together.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government should make it clear, first, to the Irish people and, secondly to the US-led Coalition and the United Nations Secretary General that they fully support this peace initiative and believe the war should now stop regardless of the Iraqi response.  The United Nations Organisation should negotiate the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and help establish lasting political structures in the region using whatever diplomatic, political and economic options open to them.  In view of this peace initiative and the declaration by the Iraqi Government that they intend to withdraw from Kuwait we should no longer assist this war by providing refuelling facilities at Shannon or overflight facilities for military craft involved in this war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to make it clear that the Government, <Col N="1422" /> like everyone else in Ireland, profoundly regret the injuries and death caused to the people of Iraq since this war, which was a response to the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August last, began.</P>
      <P>The Government continue to monitor carefully the reports from Moscow, Baghdad and Teheran concerning an initiative to bring the war to an end. Deputies will join with me in wishing this initiative every success.  However, it remains true that a solution is possible only on the basis of respect for the principles set out by the Security Council and compliance by Iraq with the Security Council Resolutions.  Iraq must give an unequivocal and unconditional commitment to withdraw from Kuwait forthwith.</P>
      <P>As the House has already been informed, Ireland will support any initiative which offers a reasonable chance of ending hostilities on the basis of full compliance by Iraq with the Security Council Resolutions, including in particular withdrawal from Kuwait.  For any initiative to have a reasonable chance of success, a necessary condition is an indication by the Government of Iraq of their clear decision to comply with the UN Security Council Resolutions.  Unfortunately, the President of Iraq has still not given such an indication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Irish people experienced a great sense of relief at the first reports from Baghdad last Friday containing the specific statement that Iraq was now prepared to co-operate in the implementation of Resolution 660.  However, almost immediately after those first reports came the news that the Iraqi proposal linked withdrawal to a number of conditions.  It is not clear exactly how many conditions were attached by Iraq to its declared readiness to withdraw. There were at least eight, including Israeli withdrawal from the Occupied Territories and cancellation of all debts owed by Iraq.  While the declared commitment to comply with Resolution 660 was important as a first indication of Iraqi <Col N="1423" /> reconsideration of its approach the associated conditions made the announcement unacceptable.  The Iraqi leadership must make it perfectly clear that it agrees to full and complete withdrawal from Kuwait without conditions.</P>
    <P>The current initiative by the Soviet authorities is of potentially great interest. Iraq's Foreign Minister, Mr. Tariq Aziz, visited Moscow on 18 February and had discussions with, among others, President Gorbachev.  The Soviet Government have not thought it appropriate to publicise the details of the diplomatic action they have undertaken to end the war.  It would not be proper for me to support action, the details of which remain unclear, but I can say that the Government support President Gorbachev's appeal to the Iraqi authorities to comply in full with the Resolutions of the Security Council.  This appeal is welcome, and I hope Iraq heeds it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tariq Aziz is due back in Moscow today to convey President Saddam Hussein's reaction to the Soviet authorities. The United Nations Security Council are awaiting developments.  The Irish Government clearly support the appeal to the Iraqi Government for full and unconditional implementation of all the relevant Resolutions of the UN Security Council, thus putting an end to the conflict and sparing new sufferings to the peoples of Iraq and Kuwait.  The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the European Community made a similar appeal on 19 February.  Such a commitment on the part of the Iraqi Government would have prevented hostilities as from 15 January: the key to the cessation of hostilities still lies with Baghdad.  Regretfully, the speech just made by Saddam Hussein in Baghdad is not very encouraging.</P>
    <P>Like all Members of this House, the Government are concerned at reports of civilian casualties and at the risks to which civilians have been exposed.  The Secretary-General of the United Nations has pointed out that the physical dangers <Col N="1424" /> from the bombing attacks are compounded by the hazards to public health that are daily growing more acute in the absence of electricity and the shortage of clean water.  The implications for the innocent and especially vulnerable groups such as women, children and the elderly are particularly disturbing.  The longer the war goes on the greater becomes the danger that more civilians will be caught up in the violence.  I would like to emphasise that I share with all Members of this House and with all Irish people the profound sense of regret at the effect to this tragedy on the peoples of Kuwait and Iraq.  I believe that the best way to help them is to bring the war to a conclusion as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The key to a ceasefire and an end to the hostilities lies in Baghdad.  I do most solemnly urge the Iraqi leadership to announce its firm intention to withdraw from Kuwait, to confirm this by action to the end, and to refrain from associating this, its duty under the United Nations Charter, with conditions which are unacceptable. The taking of such action by Baghdad would bring an end to military action.</P>

      <P>The future of second level education in Portlaoise is most uncertain, and parents, teachers and, most importantly, children fear for their future needs.  Concern in the town is rapidly turning to anger and distress.  The <Col N="1425" /> Presentation Convent, Christian Brothers' school and vocational school have contributed in a huge way to the education and welfare of children throughout the entire county of Laois for generations.  There is no doubt that all these first-class institutions are in need of refurbishment, expansion and significant modernisation, and the manner of these improvements is crucial.</P>
      <P>The Minister is attempting to wash her hands of the matter by cleverly kicking for touch and saying the decision-making process is in the hands of the local community. The Minister has chosen to ignore that her precondition in the source of the problem, namely, one school for Portlaoise.  I ask the Minister if one school, one building is suitable for up to 1,300 young people.  I am not asking if it is acceptable, workable or financially viable, but if it is in the best interests of the children.  There can be no further progress at local level until the Minister intervenes.  Without ministerial action hundreds of children will suffer.  The scenario as proposed by the Minister is most undesirable.  I contend that the welfare of our children must be the primary responsibility of any Minister for Education, and the decision on Portlaoise cannot be delayed any longer.</P>

      <P>The school involved in my statement is Rathcormac national school, which has 352 pupils.  Like most other areas in County Sligo this school catchment area is, happily, one of a growing population.  This however has resulted in serious overcrowding in classes.  The school in Rathcormac has now reached the position where two classes, sixth and senior infants, have over 40 pupils and the remainder, with two exceptions, have over 35 pupils.  The position is not amenable to any further redistribution of pupils, as two of the classes are taught in the old school which is half a mile from <Col N="1426" /> the new school and which has very small classrooms.  The appointment of an extra teacher or a remedial teacher to which the school is entitled would solve the problem.  I would ask the Minister to sanction one or the other for this very progressive school on merit, not to mention the fact that her mother attended that school.</P>

      <P>Precisely, I endured <Col N="1427" /> what the Deputy has to say.  The current enrolment in the three post-primary schools is 1,100 plus and not 1,300 plus. The births are 28 per cent down, as they are down everywhere.  We plan schools not only for the present pupils but for the children of the future, and one school is the desired answer in the case.  I have received a letter from Ronan Rice, Máire Twohig and Connie Horgan, representing the three boards of management, and I have in turn replied and invited them to an early meeting.  The Deputy knows that, and that is why he is jumping. I hope when decisions are taken, be they locally or nationally, Deputy Flanagan will support the wish of the pupils and parents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>To reply to Deputy Nealon with regard to Rathcormac, indeed I know that <Col N="1428" /> school. It is a lovely school which is very well run and maintained.  It has a fine teaching cohort who have a great commitment to their pupils.  As the Deputy knows, the agreement under the last programme was accepted by the unions and the social partners.  Rathcormac school has now made an application for a remedial teacher, as the Deputy mentioned. The allocation of the extra teachers as provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is being made and the remedial teachers will be appointed on the basis of inspector's reports.</P>
    <P>Rathcormac school has made a very extensive submission and has written a personal letter to me, which I have passed on to the inspectorate.  Requests have been made by various schools and they will be considered together with the request from Rathcormac.  Following the Deputy's presentation here today I will have the case further reviewed and will be in touch personally with him.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 19 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>As President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in June 1990 I got agreement for the establishment of a European Community funded Veterinary Fund.</P>
      <P>In November, 1990 we submitted a detailed request for Community financial aid from the fund for the eradication of bovine TB.</P>
      <P>The EC Standing Veterinary Committee decided on 12 February 1991 to approve a revised TB eradication programme for the next three years, which will result in 50 per cent of reactor compensation being refunded by the Commission over that period.  This decision, which is subject to ratification by the EC Commission, is conditional on a number of changes in the scheme.</P>
      <P>These include new arrangements for the allocation of testing to private practitioners and I hope to have discussions with the Irish Veterinary Union in the near future.  As regards premovement testing a 60 day test will be required for the first year of the programme and a 30 day test for the subsequent two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This funding will be a major contribution to the cost of the ERAD programme and, with the co-operation of the various interests, provides the basis <Col N="1353" /> for achieving significant progress towards the eradication of TB in the national herd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Parliamentary Questions Nos. 17, 18, 20, 24, 34, 41, 47 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The Community's agriculture offer in the context of the GATT negotiations was agreed, after lengthy discussions over a period of weeks in various Council formations, at the Agriculture Council on 5-6 November 1990.  The offer provides for a 30 per cent reduction in overall support over the ten years from 1986, based on an aggregate support measurement unit together with subsidiary commitments on border measures and on export supports.</P>
      <P>In the discussion in the Council leading up to the approval of the Community's offer we secured agreement that the fundamental principles of the CAP were not negotiable and that no specific concessions would be made in regard to individual aspects of the policy such as export refunds.  The Community's global approach to the negotiations safeguards those positions.  In addition, there were particular guarantees given in the Council in November that any separate undertaking on export subsidies would be incompatible with the global approach. The offer as agreed in Council in November, together with the Council declarations in relation to the conduct of the negotiations, are in effect the parameters within which the Commission, who under the Treaty are the Community's negotiators in international trade negotiations, must operate.  This was the case at the GATT meeting in Brussels in December and continues to be so.  While the Commission negotiators at that GATT meeting indicated that the Community may, subject to certain conditions being met, be prepared to explore the possibility of undertaking some commitments on minimum market access and on the volume of products which would be exported with export subsidies, the Council never agreed to such an approach and indeed made it clear on several occasions that the negotiators had to respect the mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, agreement was not reached at the Brussels <Col N="1357" /> meeting in a number of areas of the negotiations. Instead the Director General of the GATT was requested to pursue intensive consultations with the objective of achieving agreements in all areas of the negotiating programme in which there are differences.  On 20 February, the Director General on his own initiative put forward a basis for further negotiations in a number of areas including agriculture. He proposed that the agriculture negotiations proceed on the basis of specific commitments being undertaken in regard to domestic support, market access and export competition as well as on sanitary and phytosanitary issues. These suggestions were, I understand, listened to without comment by the main participants in the negotiations, including the Commission.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the Community had already stated that it was prepared to consider reductions in export support and import barriers to the extent that these resulted from its overall offer on support adjustment.  This remains the formal Community position and Ireland will continue to insist that the Commission respect the Council mandate and that no offer be made which implies a reduction in any of the mechanisms of the CAP which exceeds the agreed reduction in overall support levels.</P>
    <P>At both of the Agriculture Councils which have been held so far this year a number of Ministers, including myself, have made clear to the Commission the necessity to respect the mandate agreed in November.  I have equally made clear my opposition to any changes in the Community's position which would exceed the terms of the mandate.  Changes such as those referred to by the Deputies have not been agreed by the Council and the Commission has been reminded and has accepted that the Council has to be consulted before there can be any change in the negotiating mandate.  I therefore expect that the Commission will continue to defend in the GATT negotiations the broad line laid down by the Council of Ministers on 6 November.  Statements by individual Commissioners or other Commission personnel on the Community's <Col N="1358" /> position in the negotiations have to be viewed in that context.</P>
    <P>We have conveyed our views on this vital issue at all times at Council, in bilateral contact with the Commission and most recently at the Community delegations which assist the Commission on the GATT on the implications of the above statement of the Director General of the GATT.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the GATT negotiations will result in reduced support and protection levels for agriculture in the Community and in the other countries participating in the Uruguay Round.  This has been acknowledged since the commencement of the negotiations at Punta del Este in 1986 and indeed the reduction in support and protection is seen as essential to the achievement of a more market oriented international agricultural trading system which is one of the principal objectives of the Round.  In all of this my priority will be to ensure that concessions in whatever policy area have the lowest possible impact on the Common Agricultural Policy and on Ireland's interests, both agricultural and in terms of our wider economy.  To offset the impact of concessions in the GATT we obtained clear commitments on the part of the Council and Commission to come forward with a satisfactory package of complementary measures aimed particularly at the needs of the most vulnerable producers and economies.  This is something that I insisted on in the discussions leading up to the adoption of the Community's offer and it should ensure that Ireland's interests can be protected in the negotiations.  We also secured commitments to the effect that, irrespective of the possible cuts in support which might eventually be agreed, support targeted at the disadvantaged areas would not be reduced.</P>

      <P>Following extensive consultations with the Egyptian authorities last year the way was cleared for the export of beef from Ireland and a shipment was made a few weeks ago.  Future shipments will depend on Egypt's import requirements.  The question of cattle exports is being pursued.</P>
      <P>In relation to Iran and Libya, there have been extensive consultations at ministerial and other levels.  Discussions are well advanced at technical level. When these are completed the timing and level of trade will be a commercial matter.</P>
      <P>The development of trade with Far Eastern countries is limited by the absence of Community export refunds.</P>

However, it is clear that the Commission proposal is to help finance local groups to implement initiatives for the development of rural communities.  The intention is that groups, which may be private, public or mixed, will be selected by the Commission, following consultation with my Department, on the basis of business plans submitted for their areas.  While it is clear from the draft proposals that the initiative will have limited geographical application in the Community my aim is to ensure that as many of our rural areas as possible can benefit.

      <P>I am satisfied that the difficulties in international markets for both dairy and beef products in 1990 were such as to leave no other short term option but to have recourse to intervention.  I would <Col N="1365" /> point out however, that the downturn in the dairy sector followed the exceptional year of 1989 when Irish dairy exports set a new record at £1.48 billion.  The restructuring of the dairy industry at present taking place should give a renewed impetus to product development directly aimed at securing additional market outlets.</P>
      <P>On the beef side, increased funding from both the Government and meat processors has enabled CBF to undertake on a priority basis a major promotion campaign for Irish beef targeted specifically at the continental EC market.  This, coupled with additional measures to regain our traditional third country markets, will enable traders to secure further commercial outlets.  The transition from dependence on the intervention support mechanism will have to be gradual and will be achieved only with vigorous and aggressive promotion and marketing by the industry.</P>

      <P>The actual implementation of the operational programme will be undertaken by my Department and other Departments and State agencies concerned. A significant element of the programme, however, relates to the encouragement of local initiative and it is my intention that local community groups will play a large role in this part of the programme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Diversification:&mdash;</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme introduces schemes of grant aid to explore the potential for development of alternative enterprises <Col N="1366" /> including animal production, horticulture, agri-tourism, forestry and services in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The animal production schemes &mdash; sport horses, deer, goats, rabbits and greyhounds &mdash; provide for aid towards the cost of housing and related facilities. In addition, there will be breeding incentives for sport horses and Connemara ponies.</P>
    <P>Under the horticulture scheme, aid will be provided on investment aimed at assisting viable production &mdash; conventional and organic &mdash; and marketing projects where there is a need to encourage development.</P>
    <P>The agri-tourism scheme provides aid for accommodation and leisure facilities. The emphasis will be on group applicants.</P>
    <P>The forestry schemes will complement the measures in other operational programmes and will have a particular potential for rural development, e.g. planned recreational forestry and forest nurseries.</P>
    <P>In general, aid at the rate of 50 per cent in less-favoured areas and 40 per cent elsewhere will apply and there will be ceilings on investments.</P>
    <P>As regards services in rural areas, a once-off grant of £5,000 for each new full-time job provided will be payable. The aim of this measure is to further encourage the provision of farm relief services, machinery pools and other similar types of joint communal action.</P>
    <P>Details of the horticultural schemes were announced recently.  Details of the other schemes will be announced shortly. Funding is also provided to promote these activities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Small and Community Enterprises:</i>
    </P>
    <P>This measure is designed to provide aid for worthwhile ideas and projects which would not otherwise qualify for grant assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rural Infrastructures:</i>
    </P>
    <P>These measures provide for the development of fishery harbours and rural roads.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Research and Development and Marketing in the Food Industry:</i>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office produces two preliminary estimates and a final estimate for each year's agricultural output, input and income. The first preliminary estimate is published in early December.  The second estimate is published in late January &mdash; early February.  This second estimate is obviously based on more complete information than the first estimate.  For instance, the preliminary indications from the December Livestock Enumertion are taken into account in the January-February estimate.  The final estimate in July is made on the basis of the final figures for the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the well established methodology employed by the CSO provides a broadly accurate picture of the overall development of output, input and income.  As more complete information becomes available, it is likely that there will be some change each year as between the first and second preliminary estimates, as well as between the preliminary estimates and the final one.  CSO's estimate in December 1990 was that aggregate farm income, income from self-employment and other trading incomes, in 1990 fell by 7.1 per cent by comparison to 1989.  The February 1991 estimate was that aggregate farm income in 1990 fell by 5.1 per cent.  This level of difference <Col N="1368" /> is well within the expected range of variation, particularly in view of the provisional nature of the basic data used and the sensitivity of the income estimate to relatively small adjustments to the larger output and input estimates.</P>
    <P>The CSO figure for aggregate farm income does not take account of the cost of interest payable by agriculture. However, within its statement on output and income it provides separately an estimate of interest payable.  There are a number of reasons why CSO does not adjust its estimate for aggregate farm income by the interest payable by agriculture to arrive at an income figure net of interest.  Firstly, some of the interest payable relates to borrowings for non-agricultural purposes.  In addition, interest received by farmers on moneys held in interest-bearing accounts are not taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Finally, CSO figures for aggregate farm income are always presented in nominal terms.  Aggregate farm income data in real terms, i.e. net of inflation, may be derived by applying the appropriate price index published by CSO.</P>
    <P>The CSO figures for changes in aggregate farm income for the last five years are as follows:</P>

      <P>Government policy in relation to the development of the non-throughbred horse industry has been outlined in the national programme for the development of the non-thoroughbred industry, the main features of which are: <Col N="1369" /> the incentive grant scheme for Irish draughts increased headage payments; grants for pony trekking and horse riding under the rural tourism scheme; the administration of the Irish Horse Register and approval of stallions; the establishment of marketing centres with National and EC aid; and the establishment of a Horse Breeding Advisory Committee.</P>
      <P>Many of the features outlined in the national programme are well under way and the Horse Breeding Advisory Committee have made several recommendations to me.  In line with some of these recommendations a sum of £75,000 was provided in this year's budget towards the cost of establishing a representative body for breeders in the non-thoroughbred horse industry.</P>
      <P>Further measures which I recently announced to develop the industry are also generally in line with the recommendations of the Horse Breeding Advisory Committee.  These measures which are provided for in the operational programme for rural development include: a grant of £150 for foals, from approved sires and dams registered in the Irish Horse Register or Connemara Stud Book, subject to a maximum of five foals per annum per applicant; a grant of £500 in disadvantaged areas and £400 elsewhere on the first foal registered from each Connemara young brood mare; the introduction of a pilot blood typing scheme; payment of a premium to selected stallion owners to encourage them to acquire better quality stallions; a grant of £700 for each of two years to the owner of each stallion participating in a performance testing programme; and the provision of a sum of up to £100,000 over the next three year period to develop computer systems and to set up programmes to facilitate the production of stallion genetic indices.</P>
      <P>The foal grant schemes will be in place for this year's breeding season.  The other schemes are currently under consideration and details will be announced as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the cost of extending the disadvantaged areas on a full-year basis will be £6.9 million, that the cost of reclassifying the disadvantaged areas will be £8.6 million on a full-year basis and that the cost of increasing and modulating payment rates in the enlarged areas will be £12 million in a full year.  The total cost, therefore, of the extension, reclassification and changes in payment rates will be of the order of £27.5 million in a full year. Approximately 70 per cent of the payments to be made under the schemes of a particular year are normally made in that year and the remaining 30 per cent of payments are carried over to the following year.</P>
      <P>The method of allocation of these moneys to the Department of Agriculture and Food is by way of the usual Estimates procedure.  A sum of £82.5 million is being sought under the disadvantaged areas subhead for 1991 to enable the carry-forward from last year's schemes and 70 per cent of the cost of 1991 schemes after extension, reclassification and changes in payments rates to be paid in 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available in the format as set out in these questions.  The Eastern Health Board provides a comprehensive range of services for the elderly including those with dementia.  The main focus of the service is community-based in line with Government policy for the care of the elderly.  The board's community services are wide-ranging and were greatly enhanced last year by the making available of a special allocation from the overall £5 million for services for the elderly throughout the country and will benefit further from the recent £3 million allocated nationally for services for the elderly.  The range of community services available include general practitioner and public health nurse care, home help services, meals-on-wheels and day care facilities. Assessment and rehabilitation services are available in the acute hospitals and in day hospitals as appropriate. These services are augmented by respite and intermittent care on a planned basis in a variety of settings.  These services continue to be developed in line with the recommendations of the working party report on services for the elderly &mdash; The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a patient, including a patient suffering from dementia, can no longer be managed in the community, in-patient services are provided by the Eastern Health Board following assessment.  This service is provided in the health board's <Col N="1382" /> own institutions and in private nursing homes either by subvention or by contracted beds.  There is a continuous demand for long-stay placement of patients in the board's area.  Admissions are made on the basis of priority need which is determined at all times by medical/social assessment.  The board's complement of long stay beds does not relate specifically to any particular community care area but is allocated in a flexible manner in accordance with the priority needs of the patients seeking admission.  Those under the age of 65 years who require long term care are placed in units for the young chronic sick or in subvented beds in private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>The break-down of long stay beds in the Eastern Health Board area is set out as follows.  These figures include provision for those suffering from dementia.</P>

With regard to course levels the emphasis in the initial stages of the college's operations will be on courses leading to the award of a certificate.  The post of college principal has been advertised, and it is expected that the appointment will be effective before the end of the current academic year.</P>

      <P>The rate of <i>per capita</i> grant in secondary schools was £140 between 1987 and 1989 inclusive.  It was increased to £150 from January 1990.</P>
      <P>The funding of community-comprehensive schools is not on a pupil capitation basis but is based on estimated general running costs of each individual school.</P>
      <P>Community colleges operate under vocational education committees.  Provision for the funding of these schools is made available through the annual current cost grants allocated by my Department to the relevant VECs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, a very significant increase in the <i>per capita</i> grant is proposed in 1992 for secondary schools not benefiting from the current provisions of caretaking and clerical services.  Similar arrangements will be made in the case of community-comprehensive schools and VEC schools-community colleges.  The rate of the <i>per capita</i> grant for secondary schools and the level of funding for other post-primary schools will be reviewed in the light of an examination currently <Col N="1389" /> being undertaken of unit costs at post-primary level.</P>
