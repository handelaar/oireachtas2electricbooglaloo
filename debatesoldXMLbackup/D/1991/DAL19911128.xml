      <P>It is proposed to take No. 10.  It is also proposed that the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.  It is further proposed that notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the following arrangements shall apply in the case of No. 10: (1) the speech of the main spokesperson for each of the groups, as defined in Standing Order 89, shall not exceed 45 minutes; (2) the speech of each other Member called on, shall not exceed 20 minutes; (3) the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be called on not later than 3.30 p.m. tomorrow to conclude the debate and the proceedings shall be brought to a conclusion at 4 p.m. and any divisions demanded on No. 10 shall be postponed until 6.45 p.m. on Wednesday next.</P>

      <P>We are prepared to agree because an inadequate debate on this subject is better than no debate at all?  A debate which is so time limited that <Col N="1374" /> there are only eight speaking opportunities for a party of 55 Deputies is inadequate and I hope that opportunities will be made for all our Deputies who wish to contribute to do so on an early occasion.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, convinced that the welfare and prosperity of the Irish people can best be advanced through Ireland's membership of the European Community, satisfied that full and balanced integration of the Community will lead to greater economic growth, social progress and increased employment, believing that the Community should have an enhanced voice in international affairs, to which Ireland can contribute, persuaded of the need for the work of the Intergovernmental Conferences on Political and Economic and Monetary Union to be brought to a successful conclusion at the European Council in Maastricht in December, fully supports the Government in their determined and constructive efforts to ensure that the new union is firmly grounded in economic and social cohesion and solidarity between the member states and that all will share fully in the fruits of its economic and social development. </P>
      <P>Ten days from now, at Maastricht in the Netherlands, a meeting takes place, which will be of vital importance for the European Community and for Ireland. What is decided there will determine the future of the Community and give shape and structure to the concept of European union.  For Ireland it will determine how well within that structure the concerns of our people are met and their interests advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues at stake are clearly crucial for us and for our partners.  Other European countries too, await our decisions; and many are eager to join the Union to which we will now give shape.  So the outcome of our meeting will have an impact well beyond the Community <Col N="1375" /> itself, and it may well have important consequences for the future of the European Continent as a whole.</P>
    <P>The negotiations leading to the meeting take place against a background of extraordinary change in the world about us.  The Community is continuing to integrate through the internal market programme and the ever-intensifying practice of co-operation on political issues.  Convergence between the Community and its EFTA neighbours is an established fact.  Germany has been unified; and the changes in the USSR and Eastern Europe have brought the Cold War to an end.  The planned economies have collapsed, and there is general acceptance everywhere now of the efficiacy of the social market economy. Global financial markets have evolved, in practice outside the control of even the most powerful national governments: and there is before us the growing challenge of crisis management on a truly unprecedented scale in particular areas of the world, when international law breaks down or is called in question.</P>
    <P>The meeting at Maastricht comes as the culmination of a process of intensive negotiation within the Community, against the background I have outlined. That process began in earnest when two intergovernmental conferences &mdash; on political union and on economic and monetary union respectively &mdash; opened in Rome one year ago.  But preparatory work had already been under way even before then.  The groundwork for the conference on political union was laid, and some of the preparatory work for the conference on economic and monetary union was done, during Ireland's EC Presidency in 1990.</P>
    <P>From time to time over this past year, I myself and other members of the Government have reported to the Dáil on these negotiations: in statements after each European Council; in replies to parliamentary questions; and in a full-scale debate in this House in July.  Outside this House, I addressed the important questions most recently, when I spoke to <Col N="1376" /> the Irish Council of the European Movement on 6 November.</P>
    <P>In any negotiation, however, it takes time for the central issues to emerge in a way which shows clearly where fundamental choices have to be made.  This is now happening in the current negotiation. We now know the shape of the draft Treaty which will be submitted for decision to the European Council at Maastricht, and I have placed copies of this draft as it stands in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>But there is still some work to be done on this draft text; and the Foreign Ministers of the Community must meet again in conclave in Brussels on Monday next to consider what exactly will go before the Heads of State and Government for decision one week from that date.</P>
    <P>Now that the fundamental issues have become clearer but the assent of Governments to the texts emerging from the negotiations has not yet been given, I want to report to the House on the choices which Ireland faces, on the policy of the Government in relation to those choices, and on the thinking which underlies that policy.</P>
    <P>After Maastricht I will, of course, return to this House to report on the outcome.  I have done this after each European Council I have attended, but I will want to do so particularly on this occasion in order to ensure the widest possible understanding, by this House and by the Irish public, of what we have agreed.  Over the next year it will be necessary for the Parliament of each member state to ratify the agreement we reach, if it is to come into effect, as we hope, on 1 January 1993.  In Ireland, because of the probable implications for our Constitution of the changes now proposed, it will be necessary to go further and seek the approval of the electorate in a referendum some time next year.</P>
    <P>I should like to begin my statement on the issues by recalling the fundamental principles on which our policy rests.  When I spoke in this House on 9 July I pointed out that Ireland's commitment to European integration goes back now for more than 30 years, to 1961.  We first applied <Col N="1377" /> for membership of the Community in that year, when the European Economic Community as such was only four years old.  It is true that it took another 12 years before we joined, but that initial policy decision set us on the path to membership, and it pointed a direction for Irish policy, which has been followed by every Irish Government elected here for over 30 years.</P>
    <P>Already in the decades after the State was established, successive Irish Governments had worked with other countries in the League of Nations, to establish collective security and to create a world order built on justice and the rule of law.</P>
    <P>In deciding to apply for membership of the new European Economic Community the then Irish Government were responding to the very different circumstances of that time.  The war had ended and countries of Western Europe which had been in conflict had come together to create a new structure of co-operation which had no precedent in international life.  We wanted to be part of what they were seeking to do.</P>
    <P>The immediate means of those who founded the Community were economic; their deepest aims were profoundly political. They wanted &mdash; as the United Nations Charter puts it &mdash;&ldquo;to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war&rdquo;.  The vision &mdash; the word is not too strong &mdash; which underlay their practical efforts at economic co-operation is nowhere better expressed than in the Preamble to the very first of the Treaties &mdash; that which established the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951. There they spoke of their resolve in the following terms:</P>
    <P>To substitute for age-old rivalries the merging of their essential interests; to create, by establishing an economic community, the basis for a broader and deeper community among peoples long divided by bloody conflicts; and to lay the foundations for institutions which will give direction to a destiny henceforward shared. </P>
    <P>Of course, in applying in 1961 for membership of what was then the four year <Col N="1378" /> old European Economic Community, the Irish Government based their decision in the first instance on what they saw as Ireland's economic interest.  The Treaties, which spoke of the creation of real solidarity, a common basis for economic development, and of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, gave promise that this was already more than an intergovernmental structure, and that it would grow and develop into a real community.  We could open new markets for our produce, and our agriculture would benefit.  It was also evident by then that this new, developing Community in Western Europe would affect us in many ways; it was better that we be a member, and that our voice should be heard from inside, as of right, in the making of decisions which were in any case going to affect our interests deeply.</P>
    <P>However, it is well to recall now that there were also deeper reasons, which influenced the fundamental commitment made at that time by the Irish Government. We saw and understood what our future partners were about, and, even at that relatively early stage, we wanted to be a part of it.  They were building on common values and a shared culture. They had committed themselves to link their interests in a thousand practical ways to create so strong a common interest that war between them would be quite literally unthinkable.  We, too, sharing those values and that culture, and free, after centuries, to make our own choice as a people, wanted to be a part of that historic enterprise.</P>
    <P>I have chosen to recall these earlier periods in our history as a State, because I believe it is well at this point to see that there is an underlying continuity in our approach.  The Community, which we joined in 1973, has evolved further since then.  We have played our full part in that evolution, and shared in its benefits. What is proposed is that at Maastricht, ten days from now, we agree together to take a further series of important steps to deepen the integration of the Community and to strengthen its institutions.</P>
    <P>This amounts to setting in place the framework, and beginning to build the <Col N="1379" /> institutions, of a European Union.  On the solid foundation of the Community and of the Single Market, which is now well on the way to being established, it is proposed that we take further steps to build an economic and monetary union; and complement this by a political union to be deepened and strengthened by successive stages.  Ireland, I firmly believe, will want to be a part of that process &mdash; the more so, because it takes place in a changed international situation, where many other countries of Europe look with hope and expectation to what we now propose to do.</P>
    <P>Thirty years ago, when we first applied for membership of the Community and 18 years ago when we joined, the wider European continent was deeply divided. East and West confronted each other across a line scored through its centre by the tides of war.  The past two years, however, have been a time of fundamental change in the political and security landscape in Europe.  The fall of the Berlin Wall did more than mark the end of a divided Germany.  It also heralded an end to the dangerous division that split the continent of Europe and separated Europe's peoples.</P>
    <P>Today all the countries of Europe are trying to come to terms with these changes &mdash; to work out new patterns of co-operation, new models, that will enhance their welfare and protect their security.  No State can stand aside from this process.  Our economic development, our future prosperity and our security are all fundamentally involved. European organisations too, some founded on the basis of an ideological and military divide that no longer exists, are themselves having to adjust.</P>
    <P>NATO, the Atlantic alliance, for example, have reviewed their policies and strategy, and adopted a wider view of security, that encompasses political, economic, social and environmental aspects.  New thinking is evident too in the new institutional relationship of consultation and co-operation that is being established between NATO and their former adversaries in the Soviet Union, <Col N="1380" /> the Eastern European countries and the Baltic States.  This new relationship envisages regular meetings between NATO bodies and these countries on security and defence matters.</P>
    <P>The CSCE also has a vital role to play in promoting stability and democracy. All European states, east and west, are members, as are the USA and Canada. The end of the era of confrontational division in Europe will permit its member countries to work together on a new basis of respect and co-operation.  Deputies will recall the contribution to this objective made by the Paris Conference of the CSCE, which I attended with the Minister for Foreign Affairs last November.</P>
    <P>In this period of change and transition the European Community is at the centre of the debate about the future organisation of relations on our Continent.  All European countries look to it as an anchor of stability in the new Europe.  It has encouraged and assisted the countries of Eastern Europe in their pursuit of political and economic reform.  It will help consolidate this through the new association agreements.  It has concluded an agreement with the countries of EFTA to establish a European economic area which will now comprise 19 countries.</P>
    <P>Many of these countries look to eventual membership as a way of securing their future, and several have applied, including two neutral EFTA countries, Austria and Sweden.  Debate on membership is under way in others, which see clearly the importance of the new steps in integration which the Community is now preparing to take, and the impact which a more coherent Community, evolving by successive stages into a full European union, will have on their interests.</P>
    <P>The outcome of our present negotiation within the Community is to be a further significant step towards European union.  When I reported to the House in July, the negotiations had not settled on the structure of a new union treaty.  It is now generally agreed that the Treaty will be based on what has been called a &ldquo;three-pillar&rdquo; approach.  This will involve, first, amendment of the existing <Col N="1381" /> Treaties to improve the efficacy of the institutions; to create new areas of Community Union; secondly, steps and procedures for the establishment of a Common Foreign and Security Policy; thirdly, provisions to strengthen co-operation between member states on issues such as immigration, which are dealt with by Ministers of Justice and of Home Affairs.  The first of these &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; will operate according to accepted Community procedures; the other two, though part of the new Treaty, will be intergovernmental in character at this stage.</P>
    <P>We accept this &ldquo;three-pillar&rdquo; approach.  It fits with the concept of an evolving union and, I believe, takes account of the present stage of development of the Community.  We would want, however, to see the way left open for the member states to go further in due course.  When the time is ripe it should be possible to bring all three &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; together in one integral Community operating according to accepted Community procedures, which have served the Community and Ireland so well.</P>
    <P>The draft Treaty, creating structures for a European union based on these three &ldquo;pillars&rdquo;, is available to Deputies in the Library.  I have explained that, while its structure and scope are clear, it is still a draft in two respects: it may be further amended at the conclave on Monday next, when the Foreign Ministers try to reduce points of disagreement to a minimum; and, even then, the text remains a set of propoals from the two intergovernmental conferences to be submitted for decision to the European Council of Heads of State and Government in Maastricht ten days from now.</P>
    <P>I have explained the broad policy approach which we bring to his new phase in Community integration; and I have described the framework for decision at Maastricht.  I should now like to focus on some of the main issues for decision in the draft Treaty which encompasses all three &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; in one single document.  I will deal first, with the proposals for a Common Foreign and Security Policy; secondly, with the role of the institutions; <Col N="1382" /> in particular, proposals to give increased powers to the European Parliament; thirdly, with proposals to confer on the Community new or extended competence and responsibilities in areas such as education, health, social policy, environment and research; fourthly, with Economic and Monetary Union; and fifthly, with provisions to promote greater economic and social cohesion, so that the benefits and the increased prosperity which the union will bring will be shared equitably between all member states.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal first with the question of a common foreign and security policy.  I spoke earlier about the remarkable transformation which has taken place in Europe over the last two years. It is clear that the Community needs to consider whether it has the means to conduct a coherent and effective external policy commensurate with these great changes.  Will it be able to meet the expectations placed in it and the challenges which lie ahead?</P>
    <P>What is now envisaged is that a series of provisions to allow it to do this will be set out in a separate chapter of the union treaty, which will replace Title III of the Single European Act dealing with political co-operation.  Under these new provisions, the union and its members states will commit themselves to define and implement a common foreign and security policy with five stated objectives: to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests and independence of the union; to strengthen the security of the union and its member states; to preserve peace and strengthen international security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter and the CSCE; to promote international co-operation; and to develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
    <P>Ireland can accept these objectives.  I list them here because they will guide and underpin the discussions in the union on foreign and security issues and the decisions taken.  They will be our essential points of reference.</P>
    <P>The draft treaty envisages that the objectives will be pursued in two ways: <Col N="1383" /> one of these will be by establishing more systematic co-operation between member states; the other by the gradual introduction of what is now to be described as &ldquo;joint action&rdquo; in the conduct of areas of foreign policy, where member states have essential interests in common.</P>
    <P>Under the first of these procedures &mdash; described as &ldquo;systematic co-operation&rdquo;&mdash; member states will inform and consult one another on foreign and security policy issues, and will define common positions in the Council; they will ensure that national policies conform to the common positions; and they will co-ordinate their action in international organisations and at international conferences. All decisions will be by consensus. The method is broadly similar to the present system under European political co-operation, and we have accepted it in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The second method of co-operation &mdash; joint action &mdash; would be new.  Its essential quality is that joint action would be binding on the member states in the positions they adopt and in the conduct of their activity.  It would be introduced initially in selected areas to be decided.  We have indicated our willingness to work on this concept, but several important questions remain to be settled, in particular, the scope of joint action and the decision-making mechanism.</P>
    <P>In so far as the scope is concerned, the negotiations are addressing the areas to which joint action should apply and how it might be gradually introduced.  One way of doing this would be to agree a list of areas and topics that could be considered for joint action, as soon as the treaty enters into force &mdash; for example, relations with the Soviet Union, policies in the CSCE, nuclear non-proliferation, arms control and confidence-building measures.  New areas could be added by unanimity after full consideration in the European Council and by Ministers for Foreign Affairs.  This is an approach that we favour and we hope it can be agreed.</P>
    <P>On decision-making we have taken the view that for joint action, which is being introduced into the treaty for the first <Col N="1384" /> time, all decisions on matters of policy should be by consensus.  Several of our partners would like to go further and provide for majority voting.  We have not ruled out the possibility of majority voting for limited implementing matters provided adequate safeguards can be built into the treaty.  The Presidency's draft envisages the use of qualified majority as a general rule for detailed implementing arrangements.  We have advocated a procedure whereby the Council would by unanimity define those implementing matters on which decisions are to be taken by majority.  A procedure such as this would admit the principle of majority voting in the area of foreign and security policy.  It would allow the practice to be introduced gradually for implementing measures, as we gain experience of the working of joint action. But it would provide an essential safeguard for member states in this new and important area.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference is also considering the question of security and defence.  These are among the most complex and difficult issues in the negotiations on political union.  Foreign Ministers will take them up again on Monday next, but it is possible that they will be among the matters that will come to Heads of State and Government in Maastricht for resolution.  Several proposals have been advanced, including proposals in recent weeks from France and Germany and from the UK and Italy.  I have pointed out that some of these proposals and ideas are appropriate to the negotiations on political union and the union treaty.  Some are more appropriate to the Western European Union and NATO, and indeed are under consideration in those organisations.  Some appear to be for bilateral action between the states concerned.</P>
    <P>We are following the wider debate on European security closely, both because of its relevance to the changed European security situation, and because of its implications for the IGC negotiations. In the Intergovernmental Conference a distinction has been drawn between the <Col N="1385" /> possible longer term role of the union in European security and the arrangements that should apply in the meantime.</P>
    <P>In so far as future security is concerned, the proposal is that member states would agree in the union treaty to the formulation of a common defence policy at a later date.  The issue would be taken up in new Intergovernmental Conference negotiations in five or six years time with a view to a new treaty or amendments to the existing treaty.  This is an arrangement that we might accept, provided of course the other aspects of the chapter are settled to our satisfaction. It would leave the nature and content of a common defence policy to a future negotiation and would be in accordance with our long-standing commitment to partners that, if the Community were to develop its own defence arrangement for its security, we would consider participating in these arrangements.  The outcome of any future Intergovernmental Conference on this issue would, like the present Intergovernmental Conference, require unanimous agreement among the member states.</P>
    <P>The question of what the security role of the union should be in the meantime has not yet been settled.  I can see merit in proceeding gradually in this area, perhaps by agreeing that security considerations in the widest sense could be taken into account in the discussions under the co-operation provisions of the Treaty.  This would permit the Twelve to assess the potential implications for their security arising, for example, from the Yugoslav crisis.  But it would not entail joint action by the union in the defence area, or the union's acquiring its own military capability.  That is not an issue in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference is considering whether a link with the Western European Union might provide a way of establishing a framework within which a defence role for the Community might be developed.  Some partners see the Western European Union as an integral part of European Union with organic links to the union.  Others would prefer it to stand in an autonomous relationship <Col N="1386" /> but taking guidance from the union. Some have concerns about the implications of all this for NATO.  The different approaches have not been reconciled to the point where we have a clear view of what might go into the union treaty. But we should not rule out a relationship between the political union and the Western European Union.  I am thinking, for example, of cases where the Western European Union could have a peacekeeping or humanitarian role, where, as was agreed in regard to humanitarian aid to the Kurds, Ireland and other non-Western European Union members could act separately, in parallel and in co-operation with those partners who are in Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The provisions I have just outlined would represent a substantial advance in the way in which the Community deals with foreign policy and security issues. However, I would point out to the House that the draft treaty under negotiation would not involve Ireland in a mutual defence commitment.  Nor would it oblige us to become a member of a military alliance.  Moreover, the draft on the table recognises our traditional position in regard to the military alliances, as agreed at the second Rome Summit last year.</P>
    <P>The new treaty will enable the Twelve to develop their co-operation on foreign and security issues, and permit the union to act in a more coherent and effective manner in international affairs.  From Ireland's point of view, we intend to bring to the discussions in the union those values based on our tradition and experience that we hold dear: our emphasis that security is broader than defence; our belief that real security requires many different kinds of approaches &mdash; preventive diplomacy, negotiations, procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes, peacekeeping, and our view that the causes of instability, such as the arms race and underdevelopment, must also be tackled.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Government at the conclave on Monday next and at the European Council at Maastricht will be to seek agreement to a common foreign <Col N="1387" /> and security policy along the lines I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I turn now as a second issue to the question of the role of the institutions and in particular the issue of increased powers for the European Parliament. The Government are conscious of the balance between the different institutions which was built into the structure of the Community; and we share the view of the Commission that that balance should be preserved.  The draft treaty proposes certain changes which affect the Parliament; the Commission; the Court of Justice and the Economic and Social Committee.  I will touch briefly on each of these in turn.</P>
    <P>We favour new powers for the Parliament. It is elected democratically by the citizens of the Community, and it is right that it should have a greater role in Community decisions.  At the same time, we do not wish to see the decision-making procedures of the Community become slower and more difficult, where the need is increasingly to make them more responsive and more effective.  The proposals now on the table for decision will meet these two requirements.</P>
    <P>These proposals envisage that the European Parliament will receive some significant new powers; it will acquire the formal right to set up committees of inquiry and to receive petitions from citizens of the Community; there will be wider use of the co-operation procedure for legislation established by the Single Act; and, for the first time, Parliament will be given a right to reject legislation in a number of areas.  The new procedure will mean greater involvement of the Parliament in Community decisions.  But there will also be a series of binding deadlines which will limit the scope for delay and ensure the processing of Community legislation as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to reinforce the links and improve the dialogue between the European Parliament and the national parliaments of member states, and some orientation may emerge on this.</P>
    <P>The members of the Commission will <Col N="1388" /> continue to be nominated as at present by member states, but the draft treaty contains a provision, under which the Commissioners-designate as a body will require a vote of confirmation by the Parliament, before they are formally appointed.  To this extent, the Commission will be more explicitly seen as accountable to Parliament than at present.</P>
    <P>There is also wide support among member states for the view that the Commission, which already has 17 members, would become unwieldy and less effective, if its numbers grow further, as new member states join the Community. There is likely to be agreement to streamline somewhat the existing structure of the Commission by limiting the number of Commissioners to one per member state.  Provision may also be made for a new category of Assistant Commissioners. These points will receive further consideration.</P>
    <P>The draft treaty also contains proposals to strengthen somewhat the position of the Court of Justice.  It will in future have power to penalise member states, which fail to comply with its ruling.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged also that the involvement of the interest groups of the Community in the processing of legislation would be reinforced by the steamlining of the operation of the Economic and Social Committee. In addition the setting up of a regional committee will, if it is agreed, provide scope for regional interests to make an input into the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>Taken together, this is an important series of improvements in the institutional structure, which would in several respects make the institutions more effective and help them to respond more fully to the concerns of the citizens of the Community.  At the same time, these changes do not disturb the balance between institutions which is appropriate at this stage.  They also of course represent the limit of what can be agreed by member states at this stage of the development of the Community.</P>
    <P>A third set of issues on which I wish to <Col N="1389" /> focus is a series of proposals that there should be a development of the existing role of the Community in certain areas of activity, and that certain new areas should be brought within the scope of the treaties for the first time.  These proposals are referred to collectively as proposals for the extension of Community competence.</P>
    <P>It is obviously right that where the member states can act more effectively together, and through Community structures, they should do so.  But equally, it is right that action and decision-making should not unnecessarily be forced upward to Community level in areas where it can be handled more effectively at national level.</P>
    <P>This, briefly stated, is the important concept of subsidiarity, which has now been generally accepted as a guiding principle in the negotiation of new areas of competence for the Community.  It is likely that the new Treaty will contain an explicit statement of this principle in some form.</P>
    <P>I believe we can accept this.  Indeed, we ourselves see the principle as one which has relevance in certain areas of social policy and on some environmental issues.  But we would also want to ensure that the wording of the provision on &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo; in the new Treaty is carefully drafted, so that it does not provide a kind of general &ldquo;escape clause&rdquo;, or block in unacceptable ways the further development and growth of the Community in areas where common action is clearly desirable and in the common interest.</P>
    <P>One area of importance where it is proposed that Community competence be extended and where we have specific concerns is that of social policy.  It is proposed to reinforce the existing social chapter of the Treaty.  We accept and support this, as we accepted the principle of a Social Charter in 1989.  At national level here, relations between employers and trade unions are based on dialogue; and at Community level we welcome the contribution made in discussion by the social partners.</P>
    <P>Our specific concerns in this area are <Col N="1390" /> twofold.  First, we believe that the formulation of social policy must also take account of the pressing need to promote employment.  For this reason we have wanted to see the promotion of employment accepted at Community level, as one of the objectives of social policy.  This has now been done; and our proposal that it be included in the draft Treaty has been accepted.</P>
    <P>Our second concern is that we feel that the principle of &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo; can appropriately be applied to certain aspects of social policy, which can more appropriately be dealt with at national or local level or through the collective bargaining process.  It is our view that on such issues, each member state should be allowed to tailor its approach to its own particular circumstances, so that the overall effect of the policy will be genuinely to the benefit of those groups to whom it is directed.  For this reason, we would wish to see Community voting on some specific areas of social policy continue to be subject to a requirement of unanimity.</P>
    <P>A part of my preparations for Maastricht, I recently had a useful meeting, primarily on employment and social issues, with a delegation from the ETUC, which was led by its President, Mr. Norman Willis.  I indicated our support to the joint ETUC/UNICE proposals, which had been submitted to the Intergovernmental Conference on the role of the social partners on EC social policy measures.  These are important proposals, which are likely to be incorporated in the new Treaty, and as such will represent an important step in advancing and putting into effect EC social policy measures.</P>
    <P>An important issue in these discussions on the extension of Community competence has been the proposal that decisions in the Council on areas such as environment, research and development and what have come to be called &ldquo;trans-European networks&rdquo; should be taken by majority vote.  We for our part support the wider use of majority voting.  We think it will make Community decision-making more effective.  Our final position <Col N="1391" /> on specific areas to which it is now proposed to extend majority voting will depend on how far exactly the Community is given competence in each area; and, in relation to the environment and trans-European networks, on the Community's commitment to provide funding for activities in these areas.</P>
    <P>There are, in addition, to those I have mentioned, a number of other areas, where the extension and/or the reinforcement of the competence of the Community is under discussion.  Negotiations on some of these issues are still in progress, and it is not yet clear how far the new steps proposed will be agreed.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the important and ambitious project of economic and monetary union which the Community has set itself to achieve by defined stages.  This project has been under negotiation in a second Intergovernmental Conference in parallel with that on political union over the past year and a series of steps towards an economic and monetary union will be proposed for decision at Maastricht. These in a sense complement the steps we will now take towards political union, and some member states lay particular emphasis on this link.  Taken together, the proposals in both areas which will be in the draft Treaty justify us in saying that it will set in place for the future a general framework for European union.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is desirable now to move from the present situation to negotiate a carefully structured and balanced economic and monetary union, achieved by stages, and with adequate built-in safeguards.  Success in this project will be of great importance for the Community and for Ireland as a member state which has been a full participant in the European monetary system now for over a decade.</P>
    <P>A full economic and monetary union is to be put in place in three stages.  The Community has already embarked on stage 1 of this process &mdash; since 1 July 1990. The draft Treaty which will be before us at Maastricht is likely to provide for a series of further steps.</P>
    <P>It is widely known that one member <Col N="1392" /> state, the UK, so far maintains a general reserve on the project. Subject to this, a broad agreement seems to be emerging about the further steps which are now to be proposed for decision.  These would envisage a transition to Stage II on 1 January 1994 with the establishment of a new monetary institution &mdash; the European Monetary Institute, and a strong co-ordination of economic policies with special provisions against monetary financing and excessive budget deficits.</P>
    <P>No date would be specified at this stage for the further transition to Stage III which would put a full Economic and Monetary Union in place.  However, before 31 December 1996 there will be a review of progress, and a decision will be taken by the European Council on the timing of transition to Stage III.  The transition to this final stage would be subject to strict economic criteria and would take place only when a substantial majority of states are in a position to meet those criteria.  There would be derogations for those countries which were not yet in a position to meet the criteria; and there may perhaps be a more general deferral arrangement to meet the particular case of the UK.</P>
    <P>The main features of the proposed economic and monetary union, when it is finally in place, will be the close co-ordination of economic policies, and the establishment of a single currency and monetary policy, which will be administered by the European system of central banks.  Some of the more detailed issues are still under discussion; and many aspects of the arrangements for a full-scale economic and monetary union will be decided only at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Economic policy co-ordination in European Monetary Union will be subject to what is called a &ldquo;multilateral surveillance procedure&rdquo;.  This means that there will be regular monitoring of economic developments in each member state, and there will be an effort to combine economic policies in such a way as to ensure maximum growth and cohesion throughout the Community.  There will be a special focus on budget deficits to ensure that monetary stability in the <Col N="1393" /> Community is not jeopardised by excessive budget deficits in some countries. Though tight criteria are being set for the excessive budget deficit procedure, they are no tighter than the present policies being pursued here by the Government. In order to take account of special features such as cyclical developments which can affect the deficit from year to year, the procedure proposed will build in a wide margin of flexibility by providing for an overall assessment of the position of a member state, if the criteria laid down are exceeded.</P>
    <P>In the monetary area, Ireland has always voiced strong support for an independent Central Bank, committed to the goal of price stability and, subject to that, committed to supporting the economic policies of the Community.</P>
    <P>Because we attach such value to the credibility of the European Central Bank, we accept that it cannot reasonably be established until such time as it can take on full and unquestioned responsibility for monetary policy within the Community.  The Presidency proposal for a European Monetary Institute in Stage II has won widespread support, and we would endorse it as a sensible compromise in creating a forerunner to the European Central Bank which is to be established in due course.</P>
    <P>A major interest for many member states centres on the arrangements which will govern the transition to Stage III. Since economic and monetary convergence is a key to successful participation in the final stage of European Monetary Union, it is important that there be objective indicators to guide the assessment as to which member states can move ahead to that stage.  There is general agreement that the assessment must involve consideration of inflation rates, of budgetary performance and of exchange rate stability.  Interest rates may also feature.  It is important however in our view that this assessment should take place in a non-mechanistic way and should allow for a necessary element of judgment.  While the procedures for the transition to Stage II have still to be <Col N="1394" /> decided, we believe that they should provide that the decision to make the transition will be made by consensus, and that it should come only when a substantial majority of member states are prepared and able to move to Stage III.</P>
    <P>There is a general belief that European Monetary Union will bring benefits to the Community as a whole in growth and in employment; and this will add to the beneficial effects expected to flow from the completion of the single market.  The additional benefits in European Monetary Union will come from the removal of the remaining barriers to the free flow of goods and services within the Community and the elimination of the cost of business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that before we move to Stage III of economic and monetary union a substantial number of member states should both have the capacity and the desire to move to that stage.  I said also that there is a general belief that European Monetary Union will bring benefits to the Community as a whole in growth and in employment and that this will add to the beneficial effects expected to flow from the completion of the single market.  The additional benefits in European Monetary Union will come from the removal <Col N="1395" /> of the remaining barriers to the free flow of goods and services within the Community and the elimination of the cost of business and of personal currency transactions within the Community through the creation of a single currency.</P>
      <P>How these benefits are eventually distributed throughout the Community is of course one of our main concerns.  I will deal with that issue in a moment when I come to speak of economic and social cohesion.  I would say however that if we are to be in a position to avail of these benefits, we must ensure that our domestic arrangements are such as to enable us to meet the challenges which European Monetary Union will bring; and we must be in a position to compete successfully with our Community partners by creating the climate necessary for growth and investment.</P>
      <P>We have already been working in this direction over the past four years.  I have no doubt that, by maintaining the progress we have made on reducing the budget deficit and building up investment in the economy, we need not fear the necessary and salutary disciplines which European Monetary Union will bring.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the fifth and final issue which I singled out for discussion here, that of economic and social cohesion. The creation of a new union will involve a substantial advance in political, economic and monetary integration.  Ireland wishes to participate fully in all aspects of that process.  To enable us to do so it is essential that the union should provide for substantial measures to give effect to the principle of economic and social cohesion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;cohesion&rdquo; expresses in summary form the concept that the building of a genuine community requires solidarity between its constituent members &mdash; a solidarity strong enough to ensure that the benefits which undoubtedly flow from integration will be equitably shared and that the less developed regions, which seek to catch up with areas of greater development, will be encouraged and helped to do so.  Cohesion in this sense has been a prominent issue in the <Col N="1396" /> negotiations in both intergovernmental conferences.  I believe that it should be a concern not only for the less developed regions but for all states concerned to make an enduring success of the union.</P>
    <P>This fundamental concept, long accepted in principle by the Community, acquires added importance with the establishment of a single market and the provisions now being made for an economic and monetary union.  Each of these steps will bring clear and substantial benefit to the Community as a whole, but they may also add to the existing tendency towards concentration of investment and resources at the centre.  There is a particular need, for this reason, to put strong countervailing provisions in place.  The cohesion principle, now well established, needs to be further strengthened so as to ensure that the benefits are not concentrated in the richer, more central regions but extend equitably to all parts of the Community.  President Delors shares my views on this point and it was clear when we met in Brussels last week that we shared a common approach.  His address to the European Parliament on last Wednesday week sets out his view in detail and his appreciation that cohesion based on solidarity is one of the pillars on which the Community is constructed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Presidency's approach, which I discussed with Prime Minister Lubbers during the visit to Dublin on Friday, has accepted a number of important aspects of the Irish proposals for a revised cohesion chapter in the EC Treaty.  These include: agreement that economic and social cohesion should form part of the objectives and tasks of the Community; a provision that cohesion will be taken into account in the formulation of Community policies.  This is an essential reinforcement of the existing provisions; a requirement that the Commission should report every three years on how far cohesion is being achieved and, if necessary, make proposals to ensure that progress is made. The inclusion of this language in the draft Treaty is an important achievement by Ireland in the negotiations and we will be <Col N="1397" /> determined to ensure that there is no dilution of this language in the final stages of the conference.</P>
    <P>Of course, as well as Treaty texts, we need additional commitments to ensure that the Treaty provisions are translated into reality.  For example, the Structural Funds in the next five-year period to end-1998 are a central concern.  No one can doubt the beneficial effect of the funds in Ireland &mdash; there is practical, demonstrable evidence of this throughout the country.  This in turn is an important element in our case for a considerable reinforcement of the work of the funds in the years to come, especially in the context of Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>We will be aiming in the period leading up to Maastricht to get as clear a commitment as possible on a number of practical issues, which I strongly pressed in my recent meetings with the Presidents of the European Council and of the Commission. The endowment of the Structural Funds should be significantly increased; and their operation should be made more effective &mdash; for instance, the level of Community intervention in the financing of particular activities should be increased and the scope of the funds should be widened; there should be a commitment to the increased progressivity of the Community's own resources system to take account of the relative prosperity of the member states; and the provision of the Environment Fund that has been mooted should take special account of the needs of all of the peripheral member states, as should the provisions for the trans-European networks.</P>
    <P>These elements &mdash; a more flexible system of operation of the funds, new financial instruments or arrangements which take account of the interests of the poorer member states and a more progressive system of own resources &mdash; will be necessary to underpin the commitment of the Community to its less developed regions, as we embark on the process of Economic and Monetary Union.  Our view on these issues, I may say, is shared by the member states which <Col N="1398" /> have a similar interest to that of Ireland in the area of cohesion and we have cooperated closely with them during the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to the development of the European Community and to the goal of European Union has always been clear.  We accepted, when we joined the Community, that the Treaties were a stage in the process of European integration and that we would be engaged with our partners in further efforts towards the ideal of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe.  We have consistently supported this goal and worked with our partners to achieve it.</P>
    <P>We have participated fully in the European Monetary System since its establishment in 1979.  We supported the decision to convene the Intergovernmental Conference which led to the negotiation of the Single European Act.  During our Presidency last year, the decisions were made to convene two Intergovernmental Conferences on Economic and Monetary Union and Political Union.</P>
    <P>When the Government embarked on the current negotiations one year ago we did so with a coherent and constructive approach, which drew on our experience of the Community over the past 18 years. We wanted to play our part in building a Community, which would reflect a growing solidarity between its member states and its peoples.  The agenda we face in terms of further enlargement and the reinforcement of our ties with the rest of Europe is pressing and it must be tackled next year by a Community which has been strengthened &mdash; by a Community which is embarking on an Economic and Monetary Union and which has made a substantial new step towards Political Union.</P>
    <P>Not all that everyone could hope for will be achieved at this stage, but I believe that the proposals from the two Intergovernmental Conferences which are likely to come before the European Council in Maastricht for decision will, taken as a whole, constitute a real advance towards European Union and that they will strengthen the Community. <Col N="1399" /> I believe that these proposals will also be in Ireland's interest.  For these reasons I warmly commend the present motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;development&rdquo; to add to the motion the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;conscious of the positive contribution the creation of a Europe without internal barriers can make to the creation of additional employment, calls on the Government to adopt the following negotiating position at the summit in Maastricht:&mdash;</P>
      <P> 1.  to fully support moves towards a single European currency in conjunction with support for the Spanish insistence that a new Treaty contain a legally enforceable guarantee of adequate continuing financial support for poorer regions and states along the lines that already apply within the Federal German Constitution;</P>
      <P>2.  to support the democratisation of the European Community by giving extra powers to the European Parliament including the appointment of the President and membership of the Commission, and the introduction of a directly elected Upper House of that Parliament with equal representation of all Community states along the lines of the United States Senate;</P>
      <P>3.  to support proposals for the extension of majority voting in the Council of Ministers in order to speed up the Community decision-making;</P>
      <P>4.  to simplify the proposals for co-decision making between Parliament and Council, which are so complicated in their present form as to constitute a potential barrier to progress;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.  to insist on a commitment by Heads of Government at Maastricht to revise the current proposals to reform the Common Agricultural Policy so as to guarantee continued support for <Col N="1400" /> those forms of agriculture which, by using locally produced raw materials, guarantee the security of European food supplies in all contingencies;</P>
    <P>6.  to support the development of a security and defence competence within the Community Treaty, so as to ensure that all states in Europe have a say in matters affecting their future and the preservation from external threat of the political union that is to be created;</P>
    <P>7.  to support the vigorous development of the Council of Europe as a means of allowing all European states, including those not yet ready for full Community membership, to participate in the building of a `Common European Home';</P>
    <P>8.  to demand that the European Treaty contain a commitment to the goal of full employment and a commitment to provide the means of achieving it; and</P>
    <P>9.  to support devolution and regionalisation within member states of the Community, including Ireland with involvement of elected representatives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Fine Gael want the conference in Maastricht to be a success, a success for Ireland, and a success for Europe.  We want the Taoiseach to have a clear negotiating mandate from this House.  That will strengthen his hand.  The Government motion is so vague that it will not strengthen his hand.  The Fine Gael addendum, with specific negotiating targets will, if accepted, create a much better basis for a success at Maastricht.</P>
    <P>That Fine Gael addendum sets specific negotiating targets on: guaranteed treaty-based increases in funds for poor regions, like Ireland; a revision of the MacSharry Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals to maintain long term European self sufficiency in food, thereby helping our economy, something to which the Taoiseach did not advert; a European commitment to the creation of <Col N="1401" /> full employment and support for devolution and regionalisation so that the benefits of European development will spread through the whole country, not confined to the east coast.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael proposal will give the Government a mandate to support a more democratic Europe, with more powers for the European Parliament and the creation of an elected European Senate in which Ireland would have an equal voice with the big States, and which is not provided for in the present proposals.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael want to develop the Council of Europe so that the new East European democracies will not be treated as second class Europeans just because they are not yet rich enough to join the European Community.  Nothing is being done about this matter at Maastricht.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael wants European defence to be controlled by the European Community. We do not accept that decision on defence motions which will affect the lives of Irish people, whether we wish them or not, should be taken by outside bodies of which Ireland is not a member, and over which the European Community has no control.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael enthusiastically support the idea of a single European currency.  We want speedy decision making within the European Community by means of majority voting in the Council of Ministers. We want this to happen for the practical benefits they will bring to Irish people.</P>
    <P>Indeed it is only when you look at practical examples that you see why this Summit is so important.  Look how much it costs us not having a single European currency.  If you go on a European trip with £100 in your wallet, visit all EC states, change your money into the local currency and than back again into the currency of the next country you visit, and suppose that by some amazing good fortune you never spend any of the money, by the time you get home your £100 would have been reduced to £26 &mdash; £74 would have been wasted in the costs of simply changing your money from one currency to another and handing over the <Col N="1402" /> profits to the banks.  That waste will end if the Summit in Maastricht is a success. That example shows in a practical way what is at stake in Maastricht in a way our people can understand and appreciate.</P>
    <P>Take another example.  Irish workers frequently find that their Irish qualifications are not accepted in other European countries.  As a result they are forced to work in menial positions.  If the EC can introduce mutual recognition of qualifications by use of majority voting, overriding national vetoes, many more work opportunities will open up overseas for Irish people and work opportunities here for people from other countries. That is something that can be brought about at Maastricht.</P>
    <P>These are just a few practical examples.  It is this Government's fault that we have not had an adequate opportunity of thoroughly discussing these opportunities in good time.  All this should have been debated here six months ago.  The Irish Government should have set out their own vision for the creation of the new Europe.  In that way we would have achieved much more than we will ever achieve by the present Government's negotiating strategy of saying as little as possible and hiding quietly behind other countries, particularly behind Britain.</P>
    <P>Already there are signs that things are slipping backwards although not chiefly because of the omissions of the Government but because of the timidity of others.  Let me refer to some of the specifics.  Up to now the European Community Council of Ministers has acted on the basis of unanimous voting in most areas &mdash; in other words an explicit national veto &mdash; except those concerned with the creation of a Single European Market.  This slowed European decision making down to a snails pace, and this is bad for Ireland because Ireland stands to gain from most of the new European policies being blocked by the use of national vetoes by big countries.</P>
    <P>It was originally intended in the Luxembourg draft that the Maastricht Summit would extend qualified majority <Col N="1403" /> voting to energy, trans-European networks, competitiveness of industry, tourism, consumer protection, health protection, civil protection and culture and development co-operation.  It now seems that five areas &mdash; industrial policy, consumer protection, civil protection, culture and development &mdash; have been quietly dropped from this list.  If this is true, it is a major step backwards.  It will mean that the EC will have to deal with these five important matters for Ireland without explicit Treaty authority and on the basis of unanimous voting.  This is bad for Ireland from a number of points of view.  Rich countries will now continue to be able to veto new Community policies in these five areas.  As a small country, it is in Ireland's interest that matters like this be dealt with by the Community as a group and not by big states acting individually.  The Irish Government should &mdash; and I hope will &mdash; be insisting at Maastricht that the majority voting be brought back for these five for which it has been dropped.</P>
    <P>There is another problem for Ireland. While majority voting is still being proposed in some areas, unanimous voting is to be kept in regard to the setting up of new Structural Funds.  This is wrong. One member state &mdash; probably a net contributor &mdash; should not be able to veto a new means of finance for poorer regions while getting the benefits of majority voting in other areas.  I understand that Ireland itself has even opposed the introduction of majority voting on indirect taxation, direct or corporate taxation and social security.</P>
    <P>This is a mistake even though it had been the traditional Irish position.  These taxes should be used to provide new sources of finance to enable the EC to help poorer states and poorer EC citizens. As long as there has to be unanimity on these tax matters, one rich state will be able to block extra funds for Europe from any of those sources.  That problem will not be solved at Maastricht, at least on the basis of present proposals, and that is a mistake.  It is crazy to expect to finance a genuine federal union of <Col N="1404" /> Europe on what one gets from 1.5 per cent VAT across the Community.  In the United States, the federal Government collect 12-13 per cent of national income to redistribute through common services, with particular emphasis on helping poorer states and poorer citizens.  Even at that, US federal services are considered inadequate by many observers.  How on earth can Europe hope to create a genuine federal union while relying on only 1.5 per cent VAT, and the proceeds of diminishing import duties?  It just does not make sense.  It is foolish to talk of creating a Europe with a federal goal unless the issue of Community financing is directly and decisively faced.  The Irish Government may be &mdash; I hope they are not &mdash; wasting their time looking for promises of more Structural Funds unless the issue of how those are to be paid for is also faced in Maastricht.</P>
    <P>By supporting the maintenance of unanimity on tax matters the Irish Government are therefore, acting against Irish long term interests.  Let me underline this point.  In the United States the federal tax and support system is so strong, that if the income of the people in an individual state falls by $100 million the resultant cuts in federal taxes paid, and the resultant increase in federal transfers received through various aid schemes will absorb $40 million of the $100 million loss.  That is as it should be in an economic and monetary union such as the USA.</P>
    <P>In contrast, if the proposed European Community budgetary system, to underlie the economic and monetary union that we want to create on this side of the Atlantic, is to go ahead in its present form, the Community will only absorb $1 million of a $100 million loss as against a $40 million absorption rate in the United States.  That is not a genuine economic and monetary union.  The Irish Government should have insisted that budgetary and tax matters be an integral part of the intergovernmental conferences from the very beginning.  Failure to do so was a major strategic error, an error also made by other poorer countries in Europe. Having failed to do that they should now be vigorously supporting the Spanish <Col N="1405" /> Government's demands for realistic budgetary guarantees in the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Spanish point out that a Community financed by value-added tax, the main source of finance in the Community at present, is inherently biased in favour of the rich against the poor.  Poorer countries, like poorer citizens, have a tendency to spend a higher proportion of their income.  Therefore they tend to pay proportionately more VAT on a given amount of income.  In contast, progressive income tax and corporation tax tend to fall more heavily on richer countries and richer citizens.  As a poorer country within Europe, with more poorer citizens in European terms, Ireland should have insisted that the Community would be financed not solely by a purchase tax which falls more heavily on the poor but also by other forms of taxation. The President of the European Community, Jacques Delors, who believes in social justice &mdash; I believe he is a socialist &mdash; should have insisted on the same thing in the interests of social justice.  Why should we have a regressive tax funding the European Community if that Community has the goal of the creation of a social Europe of which President Delors so often speaks?  The Irish Government's narrowly-based intended campaign of looking for more Structural Funds to promote cohesion may lead us down a <i>cul de sac</i> unless we address the financing issue as well.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from an independent comment on the Irish Government's strategy on this matter by Professor Brigid Laffan of the Institute of European Affairs in a recent publication. She said that the prospects of the Government's campaign to achieve cohesion through extra Structural Funds were: &ldquo;limited because the policy instruments on cohesion depend on the willingness and capacity of the more prosperous parts of the community to transfer resources.&rdquo;  In other words, the whole thing remains discretionary, depending on the goodwill of other countries.  In a genuine federal union transfers should be automatic rather than depending on goodwill.  That is the position in the <Col N="1406" /> United States and within the federal union of Germany.  The transfers are automatic and not discretionary, depending on how well you get on with President Delors or Chancellor Kohl.  That is the way it should have been in the proposed Maastricht Treaty but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>Professor Laffan went on to say: &ldquo;It is far easier to assert that the Community has a responsibility in promoting cohesion, than it is to establish what kind of instruments are likely to bring it about&rdquo;.  That is the problem.  We do not know for sure whether all the EC funding on roads, FÁS courses and headage grants will actually achieve the desired results in terms of cohesion.  Let us look back at history in this regard.  It is almost 100 years since the first explicit regional policy was introduced in Ireland.  The words &ldquo;regional policy&rdquo; may not have been used but that is what it was.  It is 100 years since Arthur Balfour introduced the congested districts board in Ireland.  Those districts, most of them in the west, were to receive extra money. Indeed those districts and the money backing them have continued in one form or other up to the present day.  The IDA designated areas in IDA legislation are an exact replica and follow statutorily the areas laid down by Arthur Balfour in the 1890s.  People may not realise that, but it is something I discovered when drafting IDA legislation.  After 100 years of regional policy can anyone convincingly say that this system has brought incomes in the west in line with those in the east? After 100 years of regional policy the gap has not been closed.  Therefore how can we be sure that a similar policy will work in Europe when it did not work there for the last 100 years?</P>
    <P>As Professor Laffan points out: &ldquo;Paradoxically the politics of grantsmanship&rdquo;&mdash; a good word &mdash;&ldquo;that characterise the EC Structural Funds may, in fact, lead to expenditure at national level that is simply wasteful.&rdquo;  This expresses very succinctly my concern about the present Government's policies for Europe.  We may get a lot of European money that shows up as receipts in the accounts of the Department of Finance, but will it <Col N="1407" /> achieve self-sustaining development? This is not proven.  I contend that a serious objective study needs to be carried out to see whether the money we get from Europe is being spent to the best effect.  I cannot produce the answer to that question.  A study needs to be carried out to come up with a better answer than simply spending more money on roads because engineers happen to be ready to draw up the plans.</P>
    <P>Since 1979, the Irish pound has been linked to the Deutsche Mark.  Some economists say that as a result our pound has been consistently over-valued since then, and this has been responsible in part for our very high level of unemployment because it drove up nominal wages at the expense of jobs.  At this stage that is an academic, historic argument.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that we have already fully paid the price for having a low German-style rate of inflation, which is a major achievement.  Since 1987, in particular the Irish pound has shadowed the Deutsche Mark so closely that the two currencies have behaved as if they were one and the same.  Yet Irish interest rates are still at least one percentage point higher than German rates.  Every time there is a threat of an EMS re-alignment, as there is at present, Irish interest rates are driven even higher by short term speculative pressures.  In other words, Ireland is already paying the full monetary price for being part of a European single currency area, without getting the full monetary benefits.</P>
    <P>Why should Ireland be asked in the proposed Maastricht Treaty to wait until 1997 to have our currency irrevocably linked to the Deutsche Mark?  They are asking us to do this in order to keep the British happy.  Why should we go on for the next five years paying higher interest rates than we need to, and enjoying less overseas investment because of an artificial devaluation risk?  The risk of devaluation is artificial because it is quite clear that the Irish monetary authorities intend to maintain the link with the Deutsche Mark, and to their credit they have done so rigorously since 1986.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> I contend that we would be better off fixing a ratio between the Irish pound and the Deutsche Mark straight away, similar to the fixed ratio we had with sterling up until 1979.  We would then, at least, get the benefit of lower interest rates in addition to the advantage of extra German investment in our economy. There is no need to go on paying the price without getting the benefits and this is probably the only way we could get the benefits.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that Britain remains so reluctant to join the single European currency.  The freedom to run their own monetary policy &mdash; which some MPs are so keen to defend &mdash; has given Britain a higher rate of inflation, and higher interest rates than any of its neighbours, including Ireland.  It would be a pity if Britain stayed out of the single currency area, because if Britain stays out of the single European currency area &mdash; and Members should reflect on this &mdash; it will mean that the only land frontier in the entire Community where people would have to change money after 1997 would be at the Border on this island.  We should do everything in our power to persuade Britain to avoid that thoroughly ridiculous outcome.</P>
    <P>There is a defect in the proposals for economic and monetary union.  They do not create any coherent economic policy-making authority for Europe.  In a nation state, economic policy is initiated in the Department of Finance &mdash; it depends on how much influence the Minister has. However, no one is responsible for economic policy in the Maastricht Treaty proposals. In the proposed Maastricht Treaty, economic policy-making authority in Europe will be defused between the Commission, the Council of Finance Ministers &mdash; ECOFIN &mdash; the proposed European System of Central Banks &mdash; ESCB &mdash; and the European Parliament. All will have a finger in the pie but nobody will be fully in charge and nobody will be fully accountable to the electorate of Europe.  This is no mere academic quibble.  Choices will have to be made about economic policy.  There may be a choice at any given time between <Col N="1409" /> deflationary policies to maintain the external value of the ECU and stimulatory policies to reduce unemployment. Someone has to strike that balance, and make a choice.  In a democracy, in the final analysis a choice of that kind is made by an elected politician.  He or she is accountable if the wrong decision is made.  In the new European Economic and Monetary Union as proposed in the Maastricht Treaty, it is not clear who will be politically accountable for European economic policy.  What is everybody's business will be nobody's business and that is wrong.</P>
    <P>I suggest we give the primary responsibility for economic policy-making in Europe to the President of the European Commission.  In order to ensure that he or she has genuine public accountability I suggest we should provide also that the President be directly elected by all the people of Europe.  The election can take place on the same day as the election of Members to the European Parliament. There would then be genuine accountability for the execution of European economic policy.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht proposals on European Economic and Monetary Union set out five criteria which must be met if a country is to enter into the single currency system.  Ireland has no difficulty fulfilling four of these five criteria.  Only one will give us a problem, that is the requirement to get our debt-GDP ratio down to 60 per cent.  At the moment our debt-GDP ratio, although reducing, is 110 per cent. I do not understand why it is necessary to require a 60 per cent debt-GDP ratio as well as an ongoing limit on annual borrowing as a requirement for entry into the single currency system.  I do not understand the rationale of that proposal. I will go further and say that the need to reduce this debt-GDP ratio to 60 per cent by 1996 may require Ireland to have a more restrictive fiscal policy in the next few years than would be justified by any objective concern about inflation, interest rates or unemployment.  The Taoiseach should raise this issue at Maastricht. There are adequate controls in the other criteria to ensure that countries <Col N="1410" /> who have irresponsible fiscal policies are not admitted to the single currency system without meeting the additional requirement of the debt-GDP ratio.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment about the abolition of exchange controls, which is part of Stage I of the process.  This will mean that Irish residents will be able to bank overseas and to transfer money freely in and out of the country.  This will make it much more difficult for the Irish Central Bank to ensure that banks with their headquarters in Ireland are prudently run.  We all know what can happen if a financial institution collapses.  We all saw, and I more than any other Member of this House saw, what happened when the London operations of ICI nearly brought Allied Irish Banks to the brink. We have all seen the worldwide ramifications of the collapse of BCCI, a Luxembourg bank operating chiefly in other countries and not in Luxembourg. I am very worried that the proposed Maastricht Treaty does not contain sufficiently tough European rules to ensure the sound financial management of banks which have headquarters in one EC country but do business in other EC countries. All depositors should be properly protected, but somebody has to accept responsibility for finding the money to protect them should the bank collapse. This is not being adequately dealt with in the Maastricht Treaty.  We will have to face this problem more and more and BCCI only serves to highlight it.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the 1992 project, the so-called Single Market.  The whole project of a single European currency will not work unless we first have established a Single European Market for goods and services.  This is what is known as the &ldquo;1992 project&rdquo;, and 1992 begins in 30 days time.  For the Single Market to exist, a total of 282 new EC laws must be agreed and converted into law at national level.  At this point, 68 of these 282 laws have not yet even been agreed at European level.  There is much work still to be done to complete that agenda, before going on to the new one.  More serious still, a great many laws already agreed at European level have <Col N="1411" /> not been put into effect in member states. Unless they have been enacted in member states they are of no use to the citizen.  Ireland has a particularly bad record in this regard.  Only Italy, which has a poor reputation in these matters, and Luxembourg, which has a tiny public administration, have been slower than us in translating EC directives into national law.  This delay could in fact cost the Irish taxpayer millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>A recent decision by the European Court says that if a government fail to implement EC rules properly, people can sue for damages and be paid.  Our taxpayers may then have to pay dearly for the Irish Government's negligence in enacting EC regulations in Irish law, if somebody from anywhere in Europe could prove that he had suffered as a result of that.  If we are to have a Single Market with a single currency, it is important that the market be fair as well as being free.  The Maastricht proposals do not guarantee a fair market.  This is because there is no proposal to put a rigid limit on the help, whether in the form of social security relief, tax reliefs or grants, that rich EC states can give to their farmers and their businesses.  Ireland can never compete with them in doling out national taxpayer's money to local businesses and local farmers.  Quite simply, our tax base is too small.  Yet there is a huge danger that in the so-called fair and free market the European Community will continue to allow Germany, the Netherlands and France to go on giving unfair advantages in the form of extra tax reliefs, extra social security reliefs and extra grants to their firms and to their farmers, thereby enabling them to do our firms and our farmers out of business. The Irish Government should seek at Maastricht to put a stop to that.  They should seek to have a much stronger provision included in the Treaty in regard to State aid, whether it be by way of tax relief, social security relief or grant payments.</P>
    <P>If the Single Market is to be fair the Community should also give money to <Col N="1412" /> help finance schools in member states.  In that I include all schools &mdash; national, secondary and third level.  At the moment the EC says it cannot help schools or education; it can help only what it calls &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  Therefore, we have the ridiculous position of the EC Social Fund being used to subsidise trainee accountants while EC funds are being refused for the provision of remedial teachers in primary and secondary schools.  Only a minority of our third level colleges or third level students qualify for EC help. That position is ridiculous and also unfair when one bears in mind that the graduates of Irish schools and colleges often have to emigrate.  The employers of those people then in Britain, Germany or other EC countries receive a free gift of their education from the Irish taxpayer.  They do not have to pay any taxes towards the education of those employees, as they do towards their locally recruited employees.  In fact, that is a subsidisation of a rich country by a poor one.  I want an EC education fund to be established to help finance education in all parts of the European Community where there is net outward migration.  That would redress the imbalance to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the political, as distinct from the economic, aspects of the Maastricht Conference. The first issue is that of defence and security.  I favour the European Community itself developing a defence identity. Clearly, if we are to create a political entity that political entity must be able to defend itself.  We in Ireland should be prepared to participate fully in discussions about that.  It is only by participating in discussions that we will be able to influence what happens.  The provisions in regard to European defence should ultimately be within the Treaty of Rome itself and not in any other treaty to which other countries adhere.  I do not believe that there should be separate arrangements involving only some member states to defend something that is created by all member states.  It would not be fair, for example, to ask 20 of the 26 counties of this State to accept <Col N="1413" /> responsibility to defend and police all 26 counties.  However, that is exactly what one is doing if one asks the Western European Union or NATO to defend the entire EC political union.  It is Community business and the Community should do its own business, if and when it succeeds in creating a full political union, as I believe it will.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that if more powers are to be given to the Council of Ministers to act by majority voting &mdash; and I have referred to that already &mdash; there must be extra power given to the European Parliament to go along with that. Majority voting in the Council of Ministers means that individual Ministers will no longer be democratically accountable to their home parliament for the decisions taken in the Council of Ministes. If a Minister disagreed with a decision taken by majority, he would not consider that there was any need for him to justify that decision to his home parliament; he would not be democratically accountable for it, he would simply blame his colleagues.  If we lose accountability to the home parliament as a result of the extension of majority decision, that loss of accountability must be replaced by democratic accountability at another level.  That is why there must be an extension of the powers of the European Parliament to go alongside the extension of majority voting, the two are inseparable. I am glad that the Taoiseach recognises that.</P>
    <P>I agree that the European Parliament should be involved in selecting EC Commissioners. I would not, however, favour parliamentary dismissal of individual Commissioners, as some propose.  That might lead to individuals being scapegoated on national or party grounds.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the principle, I am not happy with the form of co-decision between the Council of Ministers and the Parliament as it is on the table at Maastricht.  It is extremely complicated, long and drawn out.  In practice, it might more accurately be described as a double veto rather than co-decision.  Both Parliament and the Council would be able to veto one another.  The danger in the <Col N="1414" /> proposal is that almost all Community legislation would become a trial of strength between the Council of Ministers and the Parliament.  The issue in the legislation could become of secondary importance to be an institutional power battle between the two.  That would be a disaster.  Therefore, I contend that the form of the proposal for co-decision should be re-examined.</P>
    <P>In the longer run, as I have said already, it is essential that we have a genuine federal parliament for Europe. The most effective model of a federal parliament in the world is that of the Congress of the United States which consists of two houses.  In the upper house there is equal representation between each state.  For example, New Hampshire has as many senators as has Texas.  On the other hand, the lower house, which has budgetary overall power, gives representation to the states in proportion to the size of their population.  If we want a truly democratic Europe on a federal basis it seems to me inescapable that we should have a bicameral directly elected European Parliament.  I do not agree, as many contend in Europe, that the Council of Ministers, in the European federal structure can ever become some kind of equivalent of the United States Senate. Ministers sitting in secret session in the Council of Ministers are not directly accountable to their electorate, and that is particularly so if they operate on the basis of majority voting.  There is no access to their voting record in the way that members of the public have access to the voting record of US senators.  Indeed, Ministers are not elected to the Council of Ministers; they are elected as members of their local parliament, then elected as members of the government and then, by accident, they happen to be members of the Council of Ministers.  There is no direct relationship between them and their electorate in their capacity as members of the Council of Ministers.  In that sense, therefore, there is no direct accountability.  That is why I contend that if small states are to be protected we should have the acceptance of the principle at Maastricht &mdash; although perhaps <Col N="1415" /> not the achievement of it &mdash; of the creation of a bicameral directly elected European senate in which Ireland would have the same number of members as Germany, Italy or Britain.</P>
    <P>I now turn to another topic, the question of how best to accommodate the democracies of Eastern Europe, who are not yet rich enough to join the European Community.  Those countries are entitled, in my view, to be full partners in European politics straight away.  They should not have to spend time in any waiting room before taking their place as fully fledged partners in European development.  But how is that to be done? It would not make sense to bring those countries into the European Community at this stage because they would not be able to meet the economic criteria for membership.  Individual association agreements between individual East European democracies and the European Community are not the answer. Association agreements do not create an open, common political institution that jointly represents the common aspirations of all European states seeking to build a common European home.  I believe that the Council of Europe, established in 1949 &mdash; nine years before the Community itself was created &mdash; is the answer to that problem.  It should be used as the main instrument for overall European political co-operation.</P>
    <P>To date the Council of Europe has been unable to do this job because it can take decisions only on the basis of complete unanimity.  There are, I think, 26 member states in the Council of Europe.  Thus if, for example, the Government of Malta object to a proposal that proposal is stopped even though all other 25 members in the Council of Europe and the Committee of Ministers want it to go ahead.  That should be changed.  If it were changed I contend that the Council of Europe could become a truly dynamic body democratically representing the aspirations of all Europeans within which the European Community would be the most advanced element but <Col N="1416" /> in which all would be involved in a recognised way.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I must express concern about the way in which the European Community goes about the business of drafting new Treaty changes, such as those which are to be considered at Maastricht. The discussions leading up to the Summit in Maastricht have been going on behind closed doors for the past ten months.  Only a very small number of people actually understand what is going on.  So much paperwork has been generated &mdash; non-papers, drafts, re-drafts and so on &mdash; that I doubt if there is anyone, with the possible exception of President Delors and perhaps one member of present company, who actually understands the entire theoretic basis of the whole project.  Most of the material, in all these drafts, has been couched in jargon &mdash; jargon like &ldquo;convergence&rdquo;, &ldquo;cohesion&rdquo; and so forth.  It is jargon chosen almost as if the authors did not want ordinary people to understand what it was all about &mdash; elitist jargon somewhat like the language used by lawyers to ensure that others do not understand the advice they are being offered.</P>
    <P>Very frequently the way in which Europe is built is on the basis of &ldquo;jargonised&rdquo; decisions which people are not actually allowed or encouraged to understand. Yet it is their business that is being transacted.  Yet we in this House will have to ask the entire electorate to vote whether or not they want to agree to these proposals some time next year.  The fact that we find ourselves in that position is not just the fault of the present Government &mdash; although I do blame them for not having a European affairs committee that is allowed to discuss the future as well as the past and for not having a foreign affairs committee.  Neither do I blame them for not having more debates in this House about European matters but all this is not entirely the fault of this or any other national Government.  The fault lies in the fact that we have an inadequate structure for discussing, in Europe as a whole, the basis on which new Treaty amendments are to be drafted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> I suggest that before the next Intergovernmental Conference to revise EC Treaties is established, there should be, first, a general political debate on the proposed direction of that Intergovernmental Conference in each national parliament.  There should be a new clause in the EC Treaty agreed at Maastricht to that effect.  I do not suggest that individual national parliaments should have the right to block an Intergovernmental Conference but all of them should be required to debate the issues at stake in the conference before it begins. Such initial debate would inform public opinion, in good time, about the underlying issues in the way that European opinion has not been informed about the issues involved at Maastricht.  This would help us to move towards a more democratic, less elitist Europe; in a word, a Europe of the people.</P>

    <P>Within the past week the Taoiseach met the President of the European Commission to plead with him privately for some commitment about Structural Funds in advance of the Maastricht Summit.  No doubt he assured the President of the Commission that Ireland would be supportive in every possible way of the things the President was seeking &mdash; all we wanted in return were a few more &ldquo;bob&rdquo; to be able to splash around <Col N="1419" /> some marginal constituencies.  The Taoiseach came back from Brussels with his tail between his legs.  He was rebuffed; in effect, he was told that there are and could be no guarantees, no sweeteners from Europe, that those days are now over.  It could hardly have been otherwise. A few days prior to the Taoiseach's meeting with President Delors Ireland had shown its concern for European priorities by being the only member state that had failed to have ministerial representation at a crucial ECOFIN meeting because the Taoiseach had just sacked his Minister for Finance and had failed to re-allocate the portfolio prior to that meeting.</P>
    <P>This debate takes place against the background of one salient fact.  Unfortunately, this debate had to be dragged from a Government over a number of months, a Government unwilling to place their position in regard to all of these complex and challenging issues of economic, monetary and political union on the record.  Unfortunately also that reluctance has continued right up to today. There now exists &mdash; as a result of the conclusion on Tuesday of this week of negotiations by the permanent representatives to the Intergovernmental Conferences &mdash; an updated, definitive, text of the draft European Monetary Union Treaty heads.  The Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Foreign Affairs and the Central Bank, I believe, have copies of this updated Treaty but this House, as we debate this issue here today, does not have an updated copy of the Treaty.  The Opposition leaders were not given copies of this latest draft, even in confidence, if that were considered necessary.  I understand that this latest document contains further concessions to the British Government position on European Monetary Union which are of considerable importance to the Irish position. Yet we are not in a position to discuss them here today.  Unfortunately the Houses of the Oireachtas are to be starved of the most up-to-date information, presumably, in case anything we say here today might be listened to by <Col N="1420" /> the Government.  Government and Oppositions in Denmark, The Netherlands, Belgium and France, to mention just some, have the latest full official text of the draft Treaty.  They are examining that text in the Foreign Affairs Committees of their parliaments on a line-by-line basis.  In a number of these member states the Government are receiving sanction on a line-by-line basis of their negotiating position at Maastricht.  But in Ireland &mdash; one of only two member states where a referendum will be required &mdash; the people have been kept in the dark for many months.</P>
    <P>I have to say that I have seldom come across any issue or topic where there is so little awareness, so little concern, among the people at large than there is on this particular topic at present.  In many ways that in itself is an indictment of the Government.  Indeed, it is the true story of the failure of Government to prepare this country for the challenges posed by Maastricht and what will follow thereafter.  If there is no awareness, and less concern, obviously there can be no preparation by the public at large.  The reason that gives rise to so much concern is because the Intergovernmental Conference at Maastricht will have momentous implications for the wellbeing of the Irish people not only in the immediate future but for the next 20 or 30 years and well beyond.</P>
    <P>Compared with the immediate problems the Government have been forced to grapple with in the area of public finances &mdash; which can be solved through our actions and prudent management &mdash; the outcome of the Maastricht negotiations and the draft Treaty which will emerge therefrom will require political changes which will be decided outside this country.</P>
    <P>I would support every effort of the Government to secure the necessary political commitments on economic and social cohesion at Maastricht.  These commitments could address the deepseated unemployment crisis, the general problem of under-investment and the inadequate level of economic activity which condemns Ireland to the prospect <Col N="1421" /> of mass unemployment and emigration for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, apart from offering general support for the position of the Spanish Government on the creation of an additional special fund to assist the peripheral economic regions, the Irish Government's position has mainly focused on an increase in Structural Funds expenditures for Ireland.  In addition, the credibility of our commitment to economic and social cohesion has been greatly weakened by the humiliating spectacle of the Taoiseach seeking to have the rules relating to the Irish Government's matching funds obligations to be &ldquo;waived&rdquo; or &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; so that the immediate problem of the 1992 budget deficit might be alleviated.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;begging bowl&rdquo; strategy or, more accurately, mentality of this Government towards European Monetary Union has greatly damaged the credibility of Ireland's justifiable case along with other regions of the Community who are less fortunate than those in the centre of Europe.  The tactics which are being deployed to squeeze a few extra crumbs from the European Community's coffers will not and cannot succeed in addressing the fundamental issue, that the increase in Community wealth arising from European Monetary Union requires new instruments to ensure a fair share for all the regions and not simply those at the centre.  In the context of Maastricht the fundamental requirement for Ireland and for the other less developed regions is an explicit commitment to an expansion of the Community's budget sufficient to give effect to the principle of economic and social cohesion enshrined in the Single European Act of 1986.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Maurice Doyle, in a wide-ranging speech on the prospects of the Irish economy, focused on the crucial issue of the need for measures to ensure the convergence of economic performance between the central and peripheral regions of the Community.  In that speech he said:</P>
    <P>In the economic and monetary <Col N="1422" /> unions with which we are familiar &mdash; the USA, Canada, Germany, Australia &mdash; the financial transfers from central government to the regions are of the order of 10-20 per cent of GNP; the total EC Budget, by contrast, it is only about 1 per cent of Community GNP. </P>
    <P>In relation to what was required to ensure movement towards economic and social cohesion, the Governor of the Central Bank specifically emphasised that &ldquo;money alone will not solve the problems: a full range of appropriate policies at the European level will be required&rdquo;. The ESRI in their recent medium-term economic review have estimated that in order to prevent the debt/GNP ratio rising as a result of the negative effects of the MacSharry Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals, personal taxes, or alternative expenditure reductions, of £700 million will be required by 1995. This estimate takes no account of further Common Agricultural Policy concessions to the US, which it is now probable will be made in the current GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>At no stage have the Government flagged their intention to treat the MacSharry proposals for what they are &mdash; a fundamental altering of Ireland's terms of accession to the European Community in 1973 and a major revision of the provisions in the Treaty of Rome relating to farm incomes and the special role of small family farms.  I am not suggesting that Ireland can set its face against mutually agreed reductions in farm subsidies in terms of price support between the EC and the US.  What I am saying is that the Government have an obligation to insist that a fundamental change in farm policy which has implications for over 300,000 people currently employed in farming/ agribusiness must be matched by a similar development in increased funding for the Regional and Social Funds.</P>
    <P>The ESRI have indicated that on the basis of unchanged policies and a 3 per cent growth rate the unemployment level in Ireland will continue to rise for the next five years due to the relative weakness of the US and UK economies.  In practical <Col N="1423" /> terms, this means that the Irish public finances will be under strong pressure from additional expenditure on social welfare, which will be required to assist those condemned to join the 265,000 people already on the dole queues.  Economists have forecast that unemployment will exceed 300,000 people some time next year.  If we do not succeed in securing a commitment for an expansion in the EC's own budget to fund economic and social cohesion measures for the poorer regions, any Irish Government for the next decade will be faced with recurring crises in our public finances.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a future in Europe, but whether this will meet our aspirations will be determined by the depth of our commitment to a new political order and the breadth of our own vision for the people of Ireland in the new Europe.  The present Government will be condemned to repeat the current exercise in self-flagellation with regard to the public finances unless we are prepared to insist that the Draft Treaty which emerges from Maastricht either contains the commitments I have outlined or, alternatively, that at the Maastricht InterGovernmental Conference the Irish Government will veto the Draft Treaty if it does not.</P>
    <P>On the domestic policy front, the Government must ensure that the improvement in the public finances which has taken place over the past eight years must not be jeopardised.  The focus on the size of the current budget deficit in any one year is inappropriate and onesided. What is required is that the domestic financial community and international investors can see Government budgetary policy over the next three years maintaining progress on a steady reduction in the debt-GNP ratio. Already, our exposure in terms of foreign indebtedness has consistently fallen over the past seven years, so reducing the risks to the Government finances and economy, which were very real in the early eighties.</P>
    <P>I want specifically to address some of the immediate problems which the <Col N="1424" /> Government must confront and, indeed, the other social partners in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> must do likewise.  The most dangerous and potentially lethal threat to the economy lies in the new Programme for Government recently concluded between the partners in Government.  The proposition that personal taxation levels can be painlessly reduced by simply ending tax incentives to the corporate sector is not grounded in the real world of business or economics. The reality which we must never forget is that the incentives in stronger EC countries for job creation are greater in terms of ECUs per job than in Ireland, in some cases much greater.  I have called on a number occasions for a complete refocusing and reorientation of our incentives for industry and for the introduction of an EC Common Industrial Policy financed by the EC to replace the system of national incentives which operates to the detriment of Ireland and other EC member states.  The CII have researched the level of national incentives in each member state and have demonstrated that these incentives in Germany are approximately 50 per cent higher than in Ireland.  When one adds the inherent disadvantages of geographic peripherality and small domestic market, we simply cannot afford to reduce the level of national incentives for investment, irrespective of how these might be packaged or targeted.</P>
    <P>The second dangerous fallacy inherent in the revised Programme for Government is the proposition that personal reductions in taxation will lead to more jobs being created.  This is the sort of &ldquo;voodoo&rdquo; economics which has brought the US to a state of economic chaos.  In relation to public service pay, I want to put it on the record that the commitments which the Government have entered into must be honoured in the interests of the whole economy and stable industrial relations.  However, it would not be unprecedented for the Government to seek adjustments by negotiation and agreement with the ICTU in relation to <Col N="1425" /> the payment dates of commitments arising from national agreements or arbitration awards in the public sector.  The public service unions have rightly highlighted the scandal of tax evasion and the moral requirement that the Government secure outstanding monies owed and taxes rightfully due next year before they can seek any adjustments or sacrifices from public sector workers.  A second consideration which, as Leader of the Labour Party, it is my duty to point out is that any adjustments in pay arrangements in the public sector must be structured to avoid hitting the lower paid worker, of which there are over sixty thousand employed in the public service.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Labour Party will oppose with all the resources which we can mobilise in the country further cuts in health, education and the social services as the means by which the public finances can be rectified.  It would be obscene if such measures were accompanied by reductions in personal taxation which can only be enjoyed by those fortunate enough to be in continuous employment while 300,000 of our people are condemned to the dole queues and up to one million people live at best a marginalised life on subsistence incomes.</P>
    <P>The relevance of democratic institutions in Ireland will be increasingly undermined unless they see that the Government's efforts both in Europe and at home are focused on doing all that is in their power to reduce unemployment which is now threatening the viability of our society.  The debt problem, which once seemed insurmountable, was tackled by the last three Governments with determination and vigour.  I believe that we can and must tackle the unemployment crisis with the same determination. Quite simply, it is not acceptable, nor can it ever be justified, that 265,000 people are condemned to languish on the dole queues.</P>
    <P>I have referred a number of times in the past to the issue of industrial policy in Europe.  I regard it as crucial because, without it, increasing numbers of people are going to be asking what is the point of European Monetary Union.  Without <Col N="1426" /> an effective approach to industrial policy, wealth creation is carried on for its own sake and not for the sake of the good of the whole community.  In the past, because Europe was a fragmented market, served mainly by local industry, a European industrial policy was neither practical nor ever considered.  Where policy was developed, it was usually as a fire brigade response to an industry in crisis.  This is why we have a European policy on steel and coal, but do not yet have one in relation to electronics or high technology in general despite the fact that more and more of these industries are lagging behind in the European context.</P>
    <P>To take electronics as a practical example, it is generally reckoned that the world's electronics industry will grow at double the rate of world GNP during the coming decade.  This will mean, on the basis of present trends, that the electronics industry will be the largest single industrial sector by the year 2000.  What is happening in that sector?  In the most recent year for which information is readily available, 1988, Europe imported 52 per cent of its electronics requirements as against the US which imported 20 per cent or Japan which imported 10 per cent. Europe exported 22 per cent of what it produced in electronics, whereas the US exported 37 per cent and Japan 28 per cent of what they produced.  Clearly, the European market for electronics is producing at least as many jobs in the rest of the world as it is producing in Europe, even though it is in Europe that the jobs are badly needed.  If one were to use other examples, I am sure the message would still be the same.</P>
    <P>I should like it to be understood that when I talk about European industrial policy I am not talking about the sort of discredited mandatory planning regime that passed for industrial policy in some parts of the world in the recent past. Neither am I talking about the kind of policy which is dedicated entirely to keeping white elephants alive.  I am talking instead about a partnership between the State and industry, where both sides recognise and understand the role of the other.  The role of industry in the model <Col N="1427" /> I have in mind is to take advantage of an environment which encourages growth and investment, to develop its competitiveness, to lead the world in research and development and to produce and deliver goods and services of the highest quality using production methods which preserve rather than threaten the environment.</P>
    <P>The role of the State in this model is to ensure that the requirements of society are met by encouraging the development of an industrial base which will promote and sustain employment, maintain the social system and enhance the quality of life of all citizens.  Citizens living on the periphery have no less right to sustaining and sustainable work on account of their geographical location.</P>
    <P>The model of industrial policy that would flow from these general principles would be one based on consensus.  It would have to take account of a number of ingredients: the development of a base of knowledge and education, together with high standards of research and development; an infrastructural framework to ensure that no part of the region covered by the policy was at a disadvantage; a regulatory framework to ensure both efficiency and proper accountability; a taxation framework to assist in providing incentives and in ensuring the wise distribution of wealth created; and the basic legislative framework to ensure that State aids and trade policy were fair and equitable throughout the region.  Above all, it would have to recognise that there is disadvantage in some parts of the Community and it would have to promote special measures to combat that disadvantage in the in terests of equality throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>If we in Ireland were to demand that the Europe which is developing everyday should start addressing the issue of a European industrial policy, in addition to the other items on its agenda, we would be doing a service for all Europeans.</P>
    <P>The same argument holds good in relation to the whole issue of social <Col N="1428" /> policy.  Many European countries have higher standards in areas such as health care, child care, education, housing provision and the rights of women than we enjoy here.  Many European countries are prepared to devote more to the nurturing of children and the cherishing of the elderly than we do.  In these and a great many similar areas we share an interest, if only in terms of the ground we have to make up on our European partners.</P>
    <P>More immediately, the European Social Charter is a document which must serve to bind the interests of all workers and citizens throughout Europe together. The headings of the Social Charter and the accompanying action programme developed by the European Commission will serve to illustrate its importance for working people throughout Europe. These headings, which are listed as fundamental social rights, include the following: the right to employment and remuneration with implied commitments to the development of minimum wage legislation and a fair deal for part time and casual workers; the right to improvements in living and working conditions, with all that means for shift workers and people in dangerous working environments; the right to social protection, which includes adequate levels of support while ill and pension and social security provision; the right to freedom of association, often under threat in times of economic retrenchment; the right to vocational training, of critical importance in a time of high unemployment; the right to freedom of movement, which has implications for our half a million emigrants and their families; the right of workers to information, consultation and participation, so important in an era when the multinational company is so dominant; the right to health, protection and safety at the workplace; and the rights of children and elderly persons to protection from exploitation and abandonment.</P>
    <P>Every bit as important as the subject matter of the Charter is its history. Unfortunately, the Charter has already been significantly diluted from its original <Col N="1429" /> publication, and there are forces throughout Europe that would be happy to see it remain on the backburner indefinitely.  It is my conviction that the Social Charter must become one of the battlegrounds of the new Europe, particularly if Europe is to fulfil the destiny that most Europeans not only want but need.  In any battle it is the united and cohesive army that wins.  However, we must ask what has happened to Irish interests in the Social Charter in recent months?  Unfortunately, the reality is that the Irish Government have become too ashamed of their position in Europe even to mention the Charter.  It is no longer on the backburner.  Thanks to the capitulation of this Government, among others, it has been taken off the cooker altogether. This is a tragedy for this country and the workers of Europe.</P>
    <P>I have to come back again to the immediate question facing us &mdash; the possible costs and benefits of Economic Union, now, for all practical purposes, a reality that is just around the corner.  In view of our economy's capacity to deal with increased competition, the most clear-cut risks of substantial costs from European Monetary Union lie on the side of Economic rather than Monetary Union.  If these costs occur it has to be said now that some of them will be self-inflicted in so far as Irish preparations for Economic Union have been practically non-existent, thanks almost entirely to a lack of leadership from the Government.</P>
    <P>Looking back over the negotiations of the past year, one thing which stands out is that Ireland has made no substantive input to the talks and negotiations.  We submitted a single document, which, if I remember correctly, ran to about ten pages of double spaced type.  That document was submitted only after questions were raised in this Chamber on what input we had to the negotiations.  That document was ostensibly about cohesion: in fact, it was only about subsidies.  This unbelievable silence in the Council of Europe has, as I have already said, been matched by the silence at home.  There has been no public debate about European Monetary Union, even though the <Col N="1430" /> key documents are available and have been analysed carefully in many segments of the international and Irish press.</P>
    <P>The danger we face now derives from the fact that the general strategy which the Government have followed at the European Monetary Union talks has been seriously flawed.  I have dealt with some of the reasons for that already, but another reason for the Government's low profile has been the very modest aim they have set themselves for this country.  This has largely been confined to getting a suitable paragraph into the revised Treaty, which could later be used as a legal foundation on which to increase the Structural Funds.  That is all the Irish Government have tried to do and at present it is not clear if even that little bit will be achieved at the end of the negotiations.  Economic and monetary union has effectively been ignored by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>There are two reasons such a subsidy approach to European Monetary Union is entirely inadequate.  Firstly, no community spends more than a small part of its resources on subsidies.  Therefore, a policy which is based on such transfers to the exclusion of other aspects of the European Monetary Union is focusing on about 5 per cent of the resources of the future union and effectively ignoring the other 95 per cent.  Nobody could describe this approach by the Government as very smart.  Secondly, the very logic of European Monetary Union makes subsidy hunting an inappropriate strategy for the medium term.  After all, when 1992 &mdash; the Economic Union part of European Monetary Union &mdash; was devised the whole idea was to increase the degree of competition in European economies.  Put very bluntly, this meant leaving companies to fight it out among themselves, with only the fittest being guaranteed survival. A company or a country which regards itself as entirely dependent on subsidies has all the wrong attitudes when it comes to survival at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The real issues for economies like Ireland in the nineties are all &ldquo;catching up&rdquo; issues.  That is to say, we have to aim at closing the income gap between <Col N="1431" /> Ireland's and the Community's average income.  Twenty years ago the average Irish income was two-thirds of the average European income.  After 20 years of European subsidies and other incentives, average Irish incomes are still two-thirds of average European incomes.  It is for that reason that the primary aim of our economic policy now in the context of Europe must be to close that gap, a catching-up strategy.  With such a clear aim there would be a focus for both economic policy in general and for specific Government Departments in particular.</P>
    <P>It would be quite different to look for funds which would fit into a coherent catching-up policy than simply to look for subsidies for no particular reason other than to announce spending projects in certain constituencies of a highly dubious economic value.  Of course, such an explicit policy would have a disadvantage for the Government, namely, the results could be measured year by year.</P>
    <P>Such a policy could not possibly rely on subsidies alone.  The objective would have to be to make a success of economic union itself.  Subsidies would probably have a role to play, but their role would be to assist in adapting successfully to European Monetary Union.  Right now, the Government's policy is to try to accumulate the crumbs instead of making sure that by our own skill and economic activity we generate an adequate slice of the cake.</P>
    <P>The question to be asked is, how, even at this late stage, can the Government be persuaded that we need to prepare on a totally different level to the level in which we have been preparing up to now?  If we are to succeed in the era of new competition the European Monetary Union entails our industry has to be far more competitive, far more efficient, and far more reliable than it is at the moment. We need economics of scale, we need research and development, we need a capacity to deliver on time, we need new products, new processes and new methods of production.  We will never be the biggest in Europe, but there is no <Col N="1432" /> reason why we should not be the best in Europe at what we are about.</P>
    <P>The one thing that is absolutely certain is that our industrial policy to date has not delivered that sense of being the best. Some time ago, an OECD survey ranked Ireland in the top two or three in terms of grants and incentives to industry, but at the bottom of the league in terms of the performance of industry when it came to quality, reliability and efficiency.</P>
    <P>It is clear from everything I have said that there is a role in all this to be played by Irish industrial policy and by European industrial policy.  If there was one message, one lesson to be learned from this debate, and if that lesson was that it is up to us to make the most of European Monetary Union, then that would be a lesson well learnt.</P>
    <P>Unless we learn it, our unemployment will grow rather than shrink in the Europe of the nineties.  Unless we learn that lesson, the gap will grow wider between ourselves and our European partners rather than narrower.  It is very late in the day for us to address the problem of our own competitiveness, but it is not to late.  What is required and required now is the kind of leadership we have not been getting since this whole debate started from the Government.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I wish to say a word about the issue of political union and foreign and security policy.  In his speech this morning, the Taoiseach spelled out for the first time some form of coherent approach on his issue.</P>
    <P>The chapter of the union treaty which is proposed to deal with political co-operation, and to define and implement common foreign and security policy, sets itself very limited objectives.  For example, it is completely silent on the whole issue of solidarity with the Third World.  It has nothing to say about nuclear disarmament.  It is very ambiguous when it talks about common values and fundamental interests.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us this morning that Ireland will accept these objectives, unchanged, and will allow them to guide and underpin discussions in the union. This is inadequate and short-sighted <Col N="1433" /> approach from the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government.  The Irish Government effectively have allowed others to dictate the principle of foreign and security policy and are prepared to accept them as a <i>fait accompli</i> as things stand.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on in his speech to talk about the new element of security policy &mdash; joint action &mdash; as an area where he would not rule out the possibility of majority voting.  This too is intensely dangerous, and represents a potential capitulation by Ireland to those elements in Europe that are still wedded to power bloc politics.</P>
    <P>I want very briefly to spell out our position on his matter.  There is an unanswerable case for a security policy in Europe that sets out to defend all the citizens of Europe from crime, terrorism and drug trafficking.  There well may be a case from time to time for Europe as a whole to become involved in peacekeeping efforts, on the same basis as the United Nations.  There is not now, and will not be in the future, any case for a European army, or for any form of permanent European military capacity.</P>
    <P>I will not support any structures that permit the development of a permanent European army, and I will not support any provisions of the union treaty which allow such a development in however potential a way.  I will support a much greater degree of co-ordination of foreign and security policy within Europe in the areas I have already mentioned.  I can envisage a situation in the future where Irish troops can be deployed on a Community-sponsored peace initiative, just as they have been in the past on the United Nations sponsored peace missions.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his speech explicitly failed to rule out a permanent alliance between the new political union and the Western European Union as it stands. The Western European Union is a military alliance which is firmly based on a belief in the nuclear deterrent and which has always seen itself as having an offensive as well as a defensive capacity.</P>
    <P>Any alliance between the political union and the Western European Union <Col N="1434" /> would be a fundamentally dangerous and wrong-headed approach for the future, and I urge the Taoiseach strongly to resist it in Maastricht, just as I have urged him to explore ways of expanding the areas of principle which will underpin the common security and foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are anxious and determined to be as supportive as possible in helping Ireland to prepare for, and to play, a full role in the new Europe. Aware of challenges and of risks, we are also aware of the potentially huge benefits in closer European integration. We want to see two things: The leadership at home&mdash;which has been sadly lacking&mdash;to help us to prepare for all the economic challenges that are coming, and a commitment in Europe to a model where every citizen will be able to benefit equally from the extra prosperity that integration will bring.</P>
    <P>Even though we are at the eleventh hour, we are still a long way from meeting those twin objectives.  Part of the work that needs to be done can be done in Maastricht, and part of the work that needs to be done must be done by a determined and united Government at home.  For those reasons, I urge the Taoiseach and the Government to consider carefully everything that will be said in the course of this debate.  I urge him to accept the criticisms that may be made as constructive and as representing the national interest.  On behalf of all Members I wish him well in the serious negotiations that must take place in Maastricht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to speak for 20 minutes and Deputy De Rossa will speak tomorrow.  Amendment No. 3 tabled by the Members of The Workers' Party reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> Noting,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the vital importance for the people of this country and of Europe of the negotiations at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference in Maastricht, which will seek to set the framework for the development of the EC,</P>
    <P>&mdash;that Ireland as a peripheral region of the Community, continues to experience higher levels of unemployment and lower living standards than the Community average,</P>
    <P>&mdash;that Ireland is the only member state of the Community not a member of a military bloc and that the new world order requires dismantling of such military blocs and the development of global security based on disarmament, confidence building and the elimination of poverty,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the lack of opportunity afforded the Dáil, Seanad and the people to debate the implications for Ireland of political, economic and monetary union;  </P>
    <P>Resolves that the Irish Government should seek inclusion in the new Treaty of the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a common industrial policy which would actively seek to develop the industrial capacity of peripheral regions like Ireland so as to achieve economic and social parity which would include the creation of sustainable employment and the elimination of poverty;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the expansion of the terms of the &ldquo;Social Charter&rdquo; to protect the rights of young people, disabled, senior citizens and other vulnerable sectors of society in the context of the Single Market and making its provisions binding on member states, rather than aspirational and that decisions in this area be made by majority rather than unanimous vote in Council of Ministers;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" />&mdash;an absolute commitment to the development of a non-militarist foreign security policy for the Community which would operate under the umbrella of the CSCE and United Nations and not the Western European Union or NATO and the elimination of nuclear weapons in the EC;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that a common foreign and security policy on this basis can only be reached if the institutions are democratically accountable;</P>
    <P>Agrees,</P>
    <P>&mdash;that conclusions reached at Maastricht should be referred, before final decision, to the Dáil for debate and approval or amendment and that the debate should only take place subsequent to their being debated by the European Parliament as outlined in the Final Declaration of the Conference of the Parliaments of the European Community (Assizes) in 1990; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the final proposals for amendment of the Treaty be put to a referendum of the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government have finally bowed to pressure from the Opposition parties for a debate on the work of the intergovernmental conferences, even if this debate has been conceded, just one week before the Maastricht Summit.  It allows little opportunity for comments and proposals from the Dáil to be transmitted to the powers that be in Brussels and other European capitals.  The fact that we are having a first real debate on European union rather than the usual reading of statements of party positions, illustrates the vacuum which the Government have allowed to develop on this issue.  We are within one week of one of the most vital meetings regarding the future development of the European Community with very major implications for the Irish economy and jobs, the development of democratic institutions in the EC and the future course of neutrality and security. <Col N="1437" /> Yet, the majority of Irish people have been afforded virtually no opportunity to familiarise themselves with the issues either from debate in the Dáil or a clear coherent statement of where the Irish Government stand on these issues.</P>
    <P>This debate is too late to seriously influence the events at Maastricht one week from now; it is too late to generate public debate on this issue and it is too late to enable the House to evolve a coherent policy on European union, much less to seek to have it implemented.</P>
    <P>This debate is based on a motion which is unique and aspirational.  It is a motion that might have had some use before the intergovernmental conference began but on the eve of Maastricht it either betrays the Government's lack of policy on Europe or it is a shameful attempt to prevent the Dáil from addressing the core policy issues.</P>
    <P>Maastricht is no ordinary Summit; it is a milestone in the most far reaching political process since independence and certainly since we joined the EC almost two decades ago.  It is an event that will shape how our economy is to develop, by whom and how decisions will be made which will affect our lives and to what extent we are committing ourselves to a shared European sovereignty which will inevitably erode our independence as a State.</P>
    <P>This motion avoids all the hard questions. It gives no indication as to what effect European union will have on our economy or on our living standards.  Will there be jobs for our children or must they emigrate to the European heartland to make a living?  When or how will we catch up with European living standards and working conditions?  Who will make the decisions in this new Europe?  Will its institutions be democratic or must we continue with the existing unaccountable bodies discussing our business in secret and marking decisions behind closed doors, just like the intergovernmental conferences have been conducting their business for the past 12 months?</P>
    <P>What do we mean by a common foreign and security policy?  The motion presented to the House by the Fianna <Col N="1438" /> Fáil and Progressive Democrats Coalition Government illustrates the woolly approach which has characterised the negotiations by the Government in the lead up to Maastricht.  In the motion there is no reference to seeking a minimum level of structural funding to assist Ireland in the new Single Market of the nineties.  There is no reference to the need for an active jobs policy to assist peripheral regions like Ireland to achieve parity with the wealthier central regions of the Community; no reference to the development of Irish neutrality or to a non-militarist, non-nuclear security for the Community.  In short, the Government, by means of this motion, are putting it on the record that Ireland, one week before Maastricht, has no specific demands to make on anything.</P>
    <P>Let us take the basis issue of democracy and the proposals for increased powers for the European Parliament. Speaking at a conference organised by the Irish Council for the European Movement on November 6 last, the Taoiseach said that Ireland was in favour of increasing the role of the European Parliament in the institutional process of the Community. That is all very well, but by how much in power to be increased?  Will it be sufficient to give it a meaningful role <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other Community institutions, as would be ensured by co-decision? Simply stating that there is significant support for this proposal is a totally inadequate response.  The Government have not provided any answers to these questions.</P>
    <P>What will the relationship be between the European Parliament and national parliaments?  The assizes held in Rome from November 27 to November 30 last year spelled out specific proposals in this regard.  These included proposals for regular meetings of specialised committees and exchange of information, organising conferences of the parliament, in particular, in relation to intergovernmental conferences and that the European Parliament should give its assent to any treaty amendments before ratification by national parliaments.  On the anniversary of this meeting, our Government have <Col N="1439" /> still not responded to these proposals. A further vital question is whether, in talking about more powers for the Parliament the Taoiseach envisages empowering the citizens of the Community to make an input into Community legislation and policy.  There must be a genuine decentralisation of power and decision-making to local communities. There is no sign of this happening here, and increasingly domestic legislation is centralising power and depriving local communities of a say over their lives.  So much for the principle of subsidiary.</P>
    <P>When and how will these powers be introduced?  This week in an interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, Fianna Fáil MEP, Mr. Paddy Lane, indicated broad support for increasing the powers of the European Parliament but added that he would not favour increasing powers substantially over the next five years.  Is this the real Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat view?  Are we to have European economic union from the end of 1992 and European democracy some time in the next century.  In the meantime we would continue to be subjected to secret decision making on matters as sensitive as the development of security policy, at Council of Ministers' or at heads of government meetings.</P>
    <P>The question of security is one of he most contentious issues in these negotiations, one on which Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have behaved most shamefacedly and secretively. The only vague reference to this area in the motion before us is to the Community having an enhanced voice in international affairs.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could clarify whether this means espousing a non-militarist policy in the wake of the ending of the Cold War, or imposing the will of the developed world on the three-quarters of the world's population who live in poverty and hunger.  The Government's position is also vague that they would allow European security policy to develop in either direction.  The problem is that it is only the militarist proposal which is being actively espoused and promoted in the IGC negotiations to date. <Col N="1440" /> Ireland is the only member state of the EC which is not a member of a military bloc.  In the past few months, the French, the British, the Italians and the Dutch have pointedly refused to spell out where they stand on the specific issue of relations between the Community and NATO, the Western European Union, the CSCE and the United Nations.  In practice, through Ireland's attendance as an observer at meetings of the Western European Union, the Government are clearly determined to allow the future of issues related to neutrality and security to be dictated by the existing NATO and nuclear powers in the Community.  In short, the game plan is to shed the last vestiges of neutrality while pretending to espouse the wait and see policy.  Indeed, the hint of Government policy which we got from the Taoiseach in his contribution today, when he referred to not ruling out a relationship between political union and Western Union, is a very clear indication of where the Government stand&mdash;they intend to allow this country to slide into some kind of participation in the Western European Union.  I interpret what the Taoiseach said here this morning as a code for the contracting out of the defence arrangements of the Community of the Western European Union.  It is remarkable for a country which is neutral and non-nuclear to become involved in this way with a body, the Western European Union whose defence policy is based in nuclear deterrents.</P>
    <P>We have a valuable contribution to make to the debate on foreign and security policy.  Instead of being dragged along on the coat tails of the militarists we should be leading the drive for a security policy aimed at demilitarisation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts, and we should be forging a foreign policy aimed at bridging the North-South divide, based on the one world concept.</P>
    <P>As the debate on European union progresses and we near a referendum, the question which citizens will want to have answered is how it will affect their daily lives, employment, wages and social services. There is an explicit commitment to social and economic cohesion in Article <Col N="1441" /> 130A of the Treaty, yet our living standards, at 67 per cent of the Community average, are still the same as when we joined the EC almost two decades ago. The Dutch Presidency draft treaty text talks about a gradual process leading to a federal goal.  A characteristic of federal states, for example, Germany, is an institutionalised reallocation of resources between different states of the union. This should also be Ireland's demand. All the indications so far are that the peripheral regions like Ireland face a very tough time indeed in the economic front with the coming into place of the Single Market.  It is not just a case of staying where we are: Ireland faces the prospect of a worsening of employment and living standards in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Since we joined the European Community we have repeated the same mistakes based on the belief that the key to curing our economic underdevelopment lay in gouging the maximum amount of EC funds available from the Structural Funds and the Common Agricultural Policy.  The ranchers, the beef barons, smugglers and some hoteliers did quite well but the end result is that after almost two decades of EC membership and tens of thousands of millions of pounds later, we are still at the bottom of the European heap on living standards and employment. We have mass unemployment, consistent high emigration and an industrial base which will find it extremely difficult to survive, much less take advantage of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The failure of current policies was conceded clearly by, of all people, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, when he spoke to the Association of Irish Chartered Accountants in London on July 1 last when he stated:</P>
    <P>despite the aspirations expressed in the Treaty, redistribution within the Community is still on a very modest level and as long as it remains at this level there seems very litle propsect of narrowing the gap between richer and poorer, it should also be noted that adaptation of Community rules has demanded much greater adjustment by <Col N="1442" /> the less developed countries, who generally have had to fall in line with the preferences of more powerful members. </P>
    <P>Later he added:</P>
    <P>The greatest disappointment has been our inability to generate new job opportunities fast enough to absorb the consistent growth in the labour force. The consequence has been persistent high unemployment and emigration... it is relevant to ask whether the community should give a higher priority to unemployment and what new approaches it might adopt in pursuit of this.  The Community's philosophy has always been to get the economy right and the jobs will follow, but this approach must be questioned in the light of experience. </P>
    <P>These words came from the man who was responsible for economic and monetary policy in this State throughout most of the late 1980s.  Given this understanding of the failure of the policies and strategies of two decades, I am extremely surprised that the Government are simply asking for more money to be heaped on a policy that is clearly not working.  The Government are not even being specific in this begging bowl request, and are simply looking for the insertion of a clause in the Treaty expressing a commitment to cohesion.</P>
    <P>Certainly we need at least a doubling of Structural Funds, but on its own this is virtually useless.  The scale of the Irish unemployment crisis is such that we must have a major programme of industrial development.  The only feasible way to achieve this is through an EC industrial policy which can direct investment to the peripheral regions into industries based on local national resources.  It is time for realism rather than waffle and the only logical demand at Maastricht must be for an industrial policy to create jobs in peripheral regions, rather than simply another dollop of Euro dough.  In this regard I will cite a few of the diverse experts and bodies who have recently <Col N="1443" /> called for a radical change in policy.  On November 18, the Professor of Finance and Banking Services in the University of Ulster, Mr. Ray Kinsella stated:</P>
    <P>If there is to be any realistic prospect of the disadvantaged regions catching up, then the Treaties must contain specific and appropriate funded policies to promote adjustment from the outset. </P>
    <P>On 20 November, launching a new study on economic and monetary union, Mr. Rory O'Donnell of the ESRI stated that the EC needs to launch a much broader range of policies to promote regional development.  On the following day the Bank of Ireland's chief executive, Pat Molloy, argued for a redirection of EC funds towards job creation in peripheral regions.  The message is clear.  The Government must insist that such changes be included in any new treaty.</P>
    <P>The Government here have, apart from hiding under the umbrella of the British Conservative Party's blocking of many social charter provisions, attempted to argue that job creation is more important than social protection in the Community.  However it is important to realise that improvement in economic performance evident in Ireland during the last eighties did not result in a decrease in poverty.  It is, vital, therefore that the fight against social exclusion and poverty is explicitly stated as a Community objective.</P>
    <P>The British Government, we know, to preserve their veto, are opposed to majority voting in the social policy area. But what is the Irish Government's position? This will be a central plank of any realistic plan to tackle unemployment and poverty in this country.  In the past year, the Government have pushed the question of poverty even further into the background.  The European Commission has defined poverty as persons, families and groups of persons whose resources are so limited as to exclude them from the minimum acceptable way of life in the states in which they live.  The one million people in this country who are <Col N="1444" /> dependent on welfare clearly fall within that category.</P>
    <P>The new Single Market will not assist that one third of the Irish population. Those without language or training skills, with educational disability, without travel mobility, those with child care or dependant responsibilities are unlikely to benefit from the new freedom of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>In addition, many of the much vaunted new jobs may well turn out to be low paid, temporary, part time, insecure and otherwise unsupported by social protection. There is a need for a specific inclusion in any new treaty of the spirit which motivated the adoption of the social charter.</P>
    <P>This must be accompanied by inclusion of specific targets, for example, a reduction of regional disparities by 2 per cent a year over the next five years.  On that basis it would take 16 years for Ireland to reach the EC average living standard but, compared with a total lack of progress in this area during the past 18 years of Irish EC membership, it is a modest target that the Irish Government must insist on as a minimum.</P>
    <P>We must also have a look at the lack of progress over the past couple of years with regard to the implementation of the social action programme.  I would like to quote a brief section from a recent report of the Oireachtas joint committee which dealt with this matter.  It states:</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, while progress on completing the internal market has been very encouraging, the same cannot be said of the Social Action Programme.  As of now, of the 47 measures originally proposed in the Programme only 27 have been submitted by the Commission and only nine, (19%) have been agreed at Council or implemented by the Commission... By comparison, of the 282 proposals in the programme for the completion of the internal market, 213 (or 75%) have been adopted by the Council. </P>
    <P>This is clear evidence of a two level pace towards economic and monetary union. <Col N="1445" /> On the economic and monetary side fast progress is being made, on the social side much slower, in fact very little, progress.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred this morning to the need for the Dáil and the people to ratify the Treaty, the Dáil by way of debate and the people by way of referendum. He also spoke of his intention to bring back to this House for debate the matters which are agreed at Maastricht. He cannot assume that matters which are agreed at Maastricht will simply be nodded through if they fall short of what the wishes of this House would be or if they fall short of what the wishes of the citizens of this country would be.  The Taoiseach cannot assume that they will be nodded through by the Dáil or accepted by way of a referendum.</P>
    <P>The Government surely must have learned a lesson from the previous Single Europen Act in 1987 when the population of the country was suddenly presented with a choice in a referendum. The people have learned from that experience and it may well be the case that if the terms which are now being negotiated and which may be contained in the revised Treaty at Maastricht are not adequate it will be open to this House and to the people themselves to seek a renegotiation of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be stressed that economic and monetary union, political union and the proposed Treaty at Maastricht are part of an evolving process and that decisions at Maastricht will not be definitive in regard to the future shape of European union but will point the way in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Single Market will finally be achieved at the end of next year.  It is important that the process of economic and monetary union and political union be got under way.  All of this should ensure its own dynamics in regenerating the overall Community economy with very real benefit to Ireland as a trading nation within that European economy.  This point is further emphasised by the large market now assured by the recent arrangements made with the old EFTA countries and the very real <Col N="1446" /> possibility of similar more permanent arrangements with neighbouring countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, to name but three countries that were formerly in the Eastern Bloc.</P>
    <P>What is emerging is a wider market, the richest in the world, to which we will have untrammelled access with a single currency operating whenever the various stages are gone through in the evolutionary process.</P>
    <P>As far as Ireland is concerned it is clear that this is not enough.  We must have countervailing measures to ensure that peripheral countries, countries that are disadvantaged both in the social sense and in the regional sense do not suffer and are capable of development and expansion.  This is a priority for us.</P>
    <P>A priority is to ensure that cohesion is a meaningful policy and not just a reference in a text.  The first objective is to substantially strengthen the Structural Funds.  To do that the Treaty must be strengthened, and I regard the arrangements made between the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Lubbers during his recent visit to Dublin as very important in this respect.  He, as President, has agreed that economic and social cohesion should form part of the objectives and task of the Community and that there will be a provision that cohesion will be taken into account in the formulation of Community policies.</P>
    <P>That is important because it takes the principle of cohesion away from the mere allocation of Structural Funds.  It broadens the concept into the whole range of Community policies and is an essential reinforcement of existing provisions.  If that is incorporated in the text it will be there in the Treaty as an ongoing reference point for the application of the principle of cohesion over the whole range of Community policies.</P>
    <P>There is also the third requirement that the Commission should report every three years on how far cohesion has been achieved and, if necessary, make proposals to ensure that progress is made.  It is important that provisions of this kind are written into the text at Maastricht <Col N="1447" /> to ensure that cohesion does not merely involve the transfer of Structural Funds but rather form part of overall Community policy, be it in the areas of agriculture, training, education, or health.  It should be agreed that the objective of removing social and regional disparities should be taken into account in the formulation of Community policies in the future.</P>
    <P>In the new Treaty provision is made for tri-annual Commission reports on progress towards cohesion.  There is scope here for Ireland to take the political initiative to ensure that there is a considerable broadening of the cohesion concept in the immediate future to cover a wide range of policies dealing with matters in which we have a clear interest, such as the dimension of human resources.  More than any other country in the Community, we have a young, intelligent population.  There is enormous scope therefore for further investment in both training and education.  If we were to do this we would be broadening the concept of cohesion rather than narrowing it so that it involves infrastructural connotations only.  It should be broadened to cover both social and regional disparities and have human as well as infrastructural connotations.  That should be the thrust of our policy in the immediate period ahead once these changes have been made to the chapter on cohesion in the Treaty.</P>
    <P>At Maastricht, Ireland should ensure that there is a degree of flexibility with regard to the transfer and administration of Community funds which should take account of Irish budgetary constraints in relation to the rate of national contribution&mdash;this means, in effect, that the intervention rate should be raised by the Community if difficulties are encountered in this respect&mdash;and the need to have a wider range of private as well as public investment projects qualify for such funding.  There is little point in the Community laying emphasis on convergence of budgetary and financial policies which demands discipline in the management of national budgets if such <Col N="1448" /> discipline, desirable though it may be, restrains and prevents the Government from making the national contribution to Community Structural Fund transfers.  It is important that this factor, on which the Community lays emphasis in regard to a reduction in the size of debts and the elimination of budget deficits, should be taken into account in conjunction with our Structural Fund requirements.  Provision should be made, as I said, for flexibility in regard to the transfer and administration of Community funds, Structural, Social and Regional Fund moneys, so as to ensure that the Community can raise the intervention rate and that the Irish contribution can be diminished if difficulties are encountered in paying our national contribution due to budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>I strongly feel that we have not advanced far enough in moving towards economic and monetary union to allow the Spanish proposal, to which reference has been made in the Fine Gael amendment, to be adopted immediately.  Proposals along those lines however merit serious consideration in the post-Maastricht period as we move, I hope, towards fiscal union.  Decisions taken at Maastricht should envisage in the near future the possibility of introducing automatic financial equalisation for peripheral and less well off regions through budget and fiscal mechanisms at Community level. The Community has not yet reached a stage where it can do this but it is moving in that direction.  The way should be left open in the Treaty to ensure the adoption of automatic equalisation measures, when appropariate.  That is all I am saying for he present.  To that extent, I agree with that aspect of the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Gilmore has stated, our case rests on the fundamental fact that 19 per cent of our workforce is unemployed. That is unacceptable as an ongoing weakness in our society.  This factor must be addressed in our preparations for Maastricht, during the negotiations at Maastricht and in our post-Maastricht policies with the Community.</P>
    <P>Apart from cohesion, there is also the <Col N="1449" /> important separate matters of political union which embodies security and defence.  It is very important that we make a clear distinction&mdash;this has already been made by the Community &mdash; between security and defence.  They are two separate matters.  Since the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, we have been functioning actively within the CSCE process to which, I am glad to say, the Labour Party amendment makes reference.  It should be emphasised that defence will not be an issue at Maastricht.  There is no point clouding the issue by creating scares, which is what some commentators want to do.  Defence will not be an issue.</P>
    <P>What the Summit will discuss is the evolution of a common foreign and security policy.  We have always been supporters of a comprehensive co-operative approach towards security matters. Indeed, I do not think we lay enough emphasis on it.  Deputy Barry, as former Minister for Foreign Affairs, is aware of the input we have made during the years and, as I said, I do not think we lay enough emphasis on it.  Since the Helsinki Agreement of 1975 we have, within the CSCE, adopted a role of positive neutrality within the framework of security co-operation in Europe.  Thirty-six countries, including Albania and the North American countries, are members of the CSCE.</P>
    <P>The barrier between east and west Europe, between NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries, has now disappeared. Let us get that matter therefore off the agenda as it is no longer relevant.  Some people however still use the Cold War rhetoric of the forties and fifties.  We should take a laser beam and cut through it as it belongs to a time when NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries strangled Europe.  The CSCE process received a tremendous lift this time last year in Paris when the CSCE member countries agreed on a new charter in regard to a comprehensive security policy for the future.</P>
    <P>We need to strengthen security arrangements of this kind within the CSCE and put them in place from the Atlantic to the Urals.  We should make it <Col N="1450" /> quite clear that new security arrangements have been put in place not just by European Community countries but by all the countries of Europe, that these will be the arrangements that will apply in the future and that the old defence arrangements are patently superfluous, be they the defence arrangements of the Western European Union, NATO or any other body, provided we give weight to the developing CSCE security arrangements in the new Europe.</P>
    <P>A common foreign and security policy in the new Europe should embody the elements on which we have always laid great emphasis with CSCE and the United Nations in regard to peacekeeping operations, co-ordination of armaments policy, non-proliferation of weapons, particularly nuclear weapons and control and reduction of armaments on a phased basis with accompanying confidence building measures so that we know, through a proper system of inspection, the dangers which may exist in a particular region of Europe in regard to developing weapons and munitions. There should be a general tightening of security co-operation in Europe within the CSCE so that armaments policies are controlled and also a thorough monitoring of the armaments industry.  We should know exactly what weaponry exists within the Community so that we can control, monitor and assess it on an ongoing basis.  That is the sort of common European foreign and security policy to which Ireland can adhere and give full support.</P>
    <P>The European Community is a tremendously important element within the CSCE foreign and security area because it is the anchor point within Europe at the moment.  There will be enlargement in the years ahead to the old EFTA and COMECON countries which will emphasise that the real power within the CSCE will be the European Community, particularly as it represents a focus of stability, in every sense, on the European continent in economic, financial, political and security terms.  It has not been conspiciously successful so far but there was evidence of realisation of this recently <Col N="1451" /> when the CSCE group of countries gave a mandate to the European Community to take action in regard to the conflict in Yugoslavia.  The troika from the European Community, sponsored by the CSCE, intervened to try to restore peace in Yugoslavia and chose Lord Carrington as its envoy.  The dimensions of the Yugoslavian conflict show the enormity of the task facing Europe in future in regard to the possibility of similar conflicts.  The only possibly stable anchor point within Europe is the Community facing up to inter-racial, sectarian conflicts.</P>
    <P>The real problem in the security and foreign policy area facing Europe today is the co-ordination of a Community policy in regard to conflicts such as the one in Yugoslavia, on the doorstep of Europe.  We see what conflicts can arise in a federal state where people are seeking the right to self-determination.  It is quite clear that, unfortunately, there is scope for similar conflicts to break out in a number of other countries, such as the Balkans and southern areas of the old Soviet Union where the plethora of nationalities will be a problem.</P>
    <P>Europe can resolve these problems in the area of foreign policy and defence via the European Community, which represents solidarity and authority.  This is necessary because of the collapse of the Marxist system in central and eastern Europe.  The European Community needs to have a common foreign and security policy which is decisive and effective.  There is a necessity for co-operation between member states in regard to legal and judicial matters and access, visa and asylum arrangements and common citizenship with the Community. I should like to emphasise that whatever institutional changes will be posed in the Community it is essential to remember that Irelands's interests lie in having a strong and effective Commission. The Commission is the body within the European Community, in the institutional sense, which is of the greatest benefit to smaller countries.  It acts as a bulwark against the bigger powers in the Community.  That is true and cannot <Col N="1452" /> be forgotten.  Whatever changes may be made in regard to enlarging parliaments and powers by way of co-operation, the fundamental balance is to maintain the power of the European Commission to implement Community policies which will benefit small countries in particular. The Commission is the guardian as far as small countries are concerned and it acts as a counterbalance to the big powers.  It is of far greater interest to us than any 19th century British notions of national sovereignty or parliamentary supremacy.</P>
    <P>These aspects, which were stressed by the United Kingdom, particularly when Mrs. Thatcher was in office, are not relevant to our interests at present.  Our interest within the Community is to ensure that the Commission's strength as the guardian of the treaties of the Community implementing cohesion policies is maintained and supported.</P>

      <P>This debate should have been held over the last four years, since the signing of the Single European Act in 1987.  Over the last two years the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities have, within their rather narrow terms of reference, kept a watching brief on the major European Community issues affecting Ireland.  As chairman of that committee I have consistently tried to involve as many Members as possible of the Oireachtas in the debates as well as Members of the European Parliament in the work of the committee.  I have had a separate dialogue with them as well as joint meetings on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately we are hampered on all sides by lack of resources, lack of power and in general a lack of debate.  With the notable exception of the recent Dáil debate on 8 November on the Common Agricultural Policy and statements in the <Col N="1453" /> Seanad, there has not been a proper debate on our committee reports for several years.  It is a tragedy that the House has not had time to debate the reports. The committee's powers of reference are so narrow that they have not been able to debate the future of the Community; they are confined to dealing with the Community on a historical basis.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach today in his speech said that there is also a need to reinforce the links and improve the dialogue between the European Parliament and the national parliaments of member states and that some orientation may emerge as a result.  I am disappointed that the Taoiseach did not enlarge on that matter. I know that the Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats contains an undertaking, on which the Taoiseach enlarged in this House some weeks ago, to change the terms of reference and to expand the role of the European Affairs Committee to allow them to meet more regularly and to have a worthwhile role to play in debating matters of European interest.  The Taoiseach said he thought legislation would be necessary in this regard; but I note that the new Minister for Finance, speaking in the Dáil last week on a Labour Party Private Members' Motion, said he would disapprove of this, or any committee, being set up on a statutory basis because it would mean a decisive change in long established practice.  As things stand, no Oireachtas Committees, even the long standing Committee of Public Accouts, are statutorily based; they were established under Dáil Standing Orders.  If that is so, I hope that we will get a new role established very quickly for the committee which I chair.  The debate on Maastricht and the matters that will flow from that are very important.  With the introduction of the free market and the future political development of Europe thoughout this decade, the time of this House obviously will be taken up with legislation on other matters.  An expanded role for the committee which I chair would allow Members of the <Col N="1454" /> House, Members of the European Parliament and the public generally to take on an educative role in that matter.  As I have said, I was glad to hear that the Programme for Government provides for increased powers for that committee and a broadening of the scope of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In recent years that committee have been participating in the Conference on European Affairs and this has made us increasingly aware of the limits of our committee compared with those of the other members states.  I pay particular regard to Britain, who have two committees which are very active.  The British committees have broader powers, meet in public and are much more active than any of the other committees and this may account for the fact that the British have been much more effective in putting into legislation EC directives.  The matters are studied properly on Committee Stage and they do not take up the time of the House on the matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general point put forward by Fine Gael about more working committees, this is a particular instance where the European Affairs Committee should be given more teeth, power, money and resources because of the importance of Europe in the future of this country.  That committee could then have a more direct role and input on behalf of the Oireachtas, would be open to members of the European Parliament, with proper resources for research, covered by the media and open to the public. One initiative we have taken in that regard is to hold meetings in public, invite people to address these meetings and to take questions afterwards.  The Commissioner for Agriculture will be addressing our next meeting, which I hope will be held in public, so that MEPs and others who wish to attend can hear what he has to say.  We are only now beginning the process of national debate on complex and far-reaching changes in the Treaties that govern our participation in the European Community.  Time has been lost and we are unclear as to what our priorities and proposals are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> The Government's approach to preparing for Maastricht has been unco-ordinated, uninspiring and unconvincing.  It is hard to know whether they really understand what is happening at Maastricht or whether they believe that by saying very little they give away nothing. This secretive and disorganised approach to policy formulation is characteristic of this Government's approach to matters like the GATT talks and talks about reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  My view &mdash; I hope the Government will accept it &mdash; is that if they take a positive and co-ordinated approach they would be in a much better position to influence policy rather than hoping people will know their intentions but saying nothing lest they have to deny it afterwards.</P>
    <P>For example, I do not know what is our understanding of and our attitude to European Monetary Union.  Have the Government examined the impact that a single currency will have?  Deputy Bruton this morning gave a very apt example of the benefits of a single European currency and the detriment to our economy of having a variety of currencies in the European Community.  This was proved to me last week when I visited London for a day.  On leaving Dublin Airport I changed an Irish £20 note for sterling and when coming back through Heathrow that night I handed in the sterling I received that morning and received £16.75.  Therefore in two transactions I had lost 14 or 15 per cent of £20.</P>
    <P>The argument for a common currency is so clear that I cannot understand the reluctance in some areas to adopt it. What we need is a positive strategy to take account of the fact that a single currency will make trade easier.  This means that importing as well as exporting will be easier.  The result may be that some large companies at present located here will transfer their central operations to other countries.  We must be prepared for that and devise strategies to ensure that they are attracted here because we are more efficient, our costs are lower, our rate of inflation is under control and <Col N="1456" /> our communications and transport systems are such as to allow them to compete with central Europe while taking advantage of increased productivity in this country.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government did not produce a White Paper on Monetary Union means that industry will not be as well prepared as it should be.  If we contrast the Government's low key preparation for Maastricht with the mainly public relations exercise which they adopted to the EUROPEN campaign, we can identify the lack of energy and resources in the preparation for Maastricht. One of the proposals for the second stage of economic and monetary union is the setting up of a European monetary institute in 1994.  I have heard no comment by our Government on what structure this institute should take.  The German Government think that it should be a club of central bank governors and that their independence should be limited. I would like to know what is our Government's view.  The Institute is an important stage on the way towards monetary union.</P>
    <P>The Government are placing too high a dependence on the role of Structural Funds in the process towards cohesion. The point has been made this morning that Structural Funds represent only I per cent of GDP of the Community.  They are inadequate and some other method of transfer of resources must be found-Deputy Bruton gave some examples of that this morning.  Many federal states, such as the United States, Canada and Germany, have a federal fiscal policy that obligatorily transfers funds to the regions.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are part of the European People's Party and the central objective of this party is a federal Europe.  We are not well equipped for federalism because of the overcentralisation of governmental structures and the lack of integrated regional plans.  Our policy formulation and implementation of policy needs to be improved dramatically.  The way the Government went about preparing for the Summit does not augur well for our future planning.  The Government are <Col N="1457" /> unclear about their approach to a number of crucial issues facing the Community. Time and again they have dodged questions, such as where should the focus of power be in the Community and how do we fashion or expand the present institutions to take account of unification and expansion.  Do the Government support more power for the European Parliament? Indeed, we could learn from the present set up in that parliament and adapt some of their procedures and working methods for the Oireachtas.  What Deputy Lenihan said earlier about the Commission being of value to the smaller countries is absolutely true, but we should remember that at present there is no accountability on the part of the Community and something will have to be done about that.</P>
    <P>For instance, the Dáil has no power to amend our budget and the lack of a proper committee system is hampering debate at every level.  We need to be better informed in order to make a contribution to the process of monetary and political union.  One issue the Government seem unwilling to address is the question of a common foreign and security policy.  Such a policy will be inevitable as we move towards political union.  This has implications for our neutrality and we should face the challenge head on. This House must begin the debate and extend it to our whole community.  We should not go around with a blinkered approach thinking that this is the only country where changes that will affect the future of Europe will take place and that the debate in other countries will not flow in here.  We should not pretend that as we move towards political union there will not be implications for our neutrality and for defence.  We should face this fact, start the debate and put the points of view from either side firmly in the public's mind so that they can make a decision on the matter when a referendum is held.</P>
    <P>The task of Government is to lead. This Government have been playing a Mr. Micawber role in this regard &mdash; they are waiting for something to turn up.  This is totally unacceptable and is outrageous at a time when decisions that are being <Col N="1458" /> made will affect our future development and prosperity.  Whatever treaties are agreed in Maastricht we will be holding a referendum.  The tone and content of that debate will be determined by the Government's approach.  Of course, if the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs had been set up, as we had been advocating here, that committee could have begun the process of debate and discussion.  That committee would have a role to play in the future development of Europe.  People need to be informed and to understand the options available to us.  We also need to discuss our contribution as well as our participation in the community of European peoples.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, because of our geographical position as well as our historical background, we have not fully grasped the European ideal.  The European Community offers a framework through which former adversaries can identify common objectives and work towards political, social and economic progress.  It is time we had a national debate on our priorities and objectives as a member of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Government must take the lead and clarify their approach to the complex, and sometimes difficult issues facing us as a national community.  This debate must be the start of a wider discussion that equips all our people with the information and policy options available to them so that they can make their choice on the future of the EC.</P>

    <P>The push for greater economic, monetary and political union in the European Community itself poses enormous challenges and opportunites for this country. I hope this debate in the Dáil will encourage further discussion among the public at large and among the sectoral interests. Major changes have occurred in Europe since 1988, but unfortunately we have not <Col N="1459" /> kept pace with the changes.  The debate should centre on the further development of the social, economic and political well being of the Irish people in the European context.  It is important that we view this debate in its European context rather than in an insular manner.  We should focus on Ireland's responsibility for the future development of the Community of which we are a full member and on our responsibility to engage ourselves in the interests and concerns of our fellow Community members.  We should also discuss the responsibility of the European Community to the wider family of European states, as well as its global responsiblities. Both the Taoiseach and Deputy O'Malley have admitted that insufficient attention has been given to the forthcoming summit in Maastricht.  This is extremely unfortunate.  Although we are discussing this issue late in the day, we at least have the opportunity to put on record our views on the position that should be taken by the Government at Maastricht.  The people need to be alerted and made more aware of the importance of Europe to their future.  Traditionally we have had more in common with the US because of our history of emigration to that country. Indeed we identify more with the US than with Europe.  We talk about &ldquo;going to Europe&rdquo;.  We need to change our attitude so that we see ourselves as part of Europe.  This change will only be achieved when there is more public debate on our role in Europe.  Unfortunately, this Government had not seen fit to do that until they were forced by the Opposition to have a debate in the House.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland have still some difficulties with seeing ourselves as a full member of the European family of nations, although we have been a member of the EC for the past 18 years.  As a member of the Community we have responsibilities as well as rights.  We have a responsibility to engage in the interests and concerns of our partners in the Community and take on board the different historical experiences of other countries. We must realise that security and defence <Col N="1460" /> are of critical importance to other members of the Community, particularly in the light of recent developments &mdash; he destruction of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and in former states of the Soviet Union.  The European states bordering these countries are paticularly concerned about security and defence and we cannot afford to bury our heads in the sand in relation to the developments taking place on that front.  These include the future role of NATO; the relationship between the European Community and the Western European Union, which is the political wing of NATO; the possible collapse of the Soviet Union; the risk of instability in parts of Eastern Europe and the danger that the national and ethnic conflicts welling up in Yugoslavia may erupt in other areas of Eastern Europe; the control of the vast stockpile of nuclear weapons in some former states of the Soviet Union.  All these issues will be discussed at European level and will impact directly on the Community.  It is better that these issues are discussed at Community level, where we can participate fully, rather than in other fora where we have observer status only.  As a first step towards redefining our position we should declare our willingness to discuss the defence aspects of security under the auspices of the Community. Security and defence will remain a key concern throughout the nineties.  Rather than finding ourselves later in this decade manoeuvered into defence arrangements not to our liking, we should take high ground and declare our willingness to participate in mutually agreed defence arrangements without Community partners which would be under the control of the European Community.</P>

      <Col N="1461" /> Last July, and again today, the Taoiseach indicated that security and defence issues are in some way unsuitable to be dealt with in the context of the decision making structures set up under the Treaty of Rome.  He has given no good reason for this view.  It could be argued that it is far more important to have these issues discussed under the existing structures, because we would all like to see a reduction in nuclear and conventional armaments.  We would like to see the Community involved in an international peace keeping role and this can be achieved more effectively by a European Community policy on defence and security. I urge the Government to take the initiative and give the lead on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The decisions to be taken at Maastricht will have far reaching consequences for the welfare and prosperity of the Irish people.  Since we joined the EC, Ireland has been an active participant in every aspect of the Community's development.  We have gained considerably from our membership and our economy has developed and begun to realise its full potential.  The way forward now is for full economic and monetary union, for greater economic growth, social progress and increased employment, provided, of course, that the essential concern which we have as a peripheral region can be accommodated within the framework of the new Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that the other major issues in Europe are the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the ongoing GATT negotiations.  These negotiations are of critical importance to Ireland.  Agriculture is by far the most important sector in our economy. Directly and indirectly the sector accounts for 20 per cent of GDP and employment.  There are 155,000 people engaged in agriculture and 36,000 jobs in the food processing industry.  It also accounts for 40 per cent of net foreign earnings.  A greater proportion of our national wealth comes from foreign trade <Col N="1462" /> than in all but one other European country. Agricultural, food and drink products account for this very high proportion of net foreign earnings.</P>
    <P>Up to now, much of the value of our agriculture and food sector has depended on the Community support system. Changes to the system are critically important for the agriculture and food sector, the fabric of rural life and the national economy generally.</P>
    <P>The Government will use every means at their disposal to ensure that the new arrangements underpin the agriculture and food sector.  The overall development of the economy depends on this vital sector.  We will, where necessary, invoke the relevant provisions of the Treaty relating to the promotion of social and economic cohesion to support our case.  It is important that we secure amendments to the cohesion provisions of the Treaty along the lines being pursued by the Government to strengthen our position.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations on the Commission's proposals for the reform of Common Agricultural Policy, we have accepted that an unreformed Common Agricultural Policy is not a realistic option.  But it is clearly important that the changes we now make are based on the principles of the Treaty and underpin agriculture, especially in regions like ours which are particularly dependent on agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals for the cereals sector are central to the overall reform process.  This is so not just because of the basic importance of the sector but also because any changes in the cereals regime will impact directly on the livestock sector.  The Commission has proposed that the support price for cereals be substantially reduced over three years.  In the Commission's view, the consequential reduction in the price of feeding stuffs would justify significant reductions in the support prices for cereals-based livestock production.  The income losses resulting from the lower cereals prices would be compensated by direct payment arrangements provided that producers not classed as smaller and <Col N="1463" /> medium-scale producers set aside 15 per cent of their arable land.</P>
    <P>The Commission is also proposing price reductions for beef and milk.  Grass-based beef and milk producers would be compensated partially for the price reductions through new or revamped premium schemes provided they observed prescribed stocking rate criteria.  There would also be a further 3 per cent in national milk quotas and further restrictions on ewe premium eligibility.  The Commission has also proposed a series of accompanying measures to assist in the adaptation process.</P>
    <P>These proposals &mdash; affecting, in the main, products we produce &mdash; would create major difficulties for us if they were adopted in their present form. While I can accept some switch form market to direct income supports, the extent and pace of the price reductions is excessive.  The effects of the price cuts will impact unevenly on different regions and the different types of production. Within the livestock sector, the comparative positions of red and white meat producers would be disturbed.  And there is an imbalance in the treatment of the compensation issue as between the different sectors &mdash; livestock producers relying on less intensive grass-based production would be inadequately compensated by comparison with more intensive cereals-based production.  As I see it, there is a lack of balance in the Commission's proposals which will have to be redressed in the forthcoming negotiations.  The vital role of agriculture and indeed some sectors within agriculture in the overall economies of some member states must be recognised.  The new approach would to a large extent freeze production at lower levels.  This is of great concern to me.  The Commission's approach would be more costly in budgetary terms at least in the short term and it is as yet unclear how the compensatory arrangements will be treated in the GATT.</P>
    <P>Action has to be taken in the cereals sector both in the interests of producers and to help restore market balance.  But, in my view, the main focus of reform <Col N="1464" /> should be directed at securing better market balance through revamped set aside arrangements and to tackling the issue of competing products such as cereal substitutes.  If there are to be price cuts, they should be less severe and phased over a longer timescale than the Commission's proposals and there must be permanent compensation for income reductions.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the negotiations on cereals will to a large extent determine what changes will be necessary in the beef and milk sectors.  I can say at this stage that if there are price reductions, there must be full compensation geared towards those producers most severely affected.  There are, in effect, family farmers whose production is mainly grass based.  But the measures proposed by the Commission would not do this.  A more realistic adjustment of the premium system than is proposed could do what is needed.  Apart from the levels of the premia, we will also need to expand the scope of the measures and ensure that the headage limits and stocking rate criteria are in line with what is necessary to maintain the viability of our family farms. Family farms are the backbone of Irish society and their status must be permanently safeguarded for the future.</P>
    <P>I have a major difficulty with the proposed further compulsory milk quota cuts.  Such cuts would have a wholly disproportionate effect on Ireland.  I am not at all convinced that we need to reduce output at this time, and in any event we should not reduce output in the absence of a parallel international agreement involving reciprocal action by our trade partners.  In my view, if there has to be a reduction in output voluntary buy-out arrangements with Community financing would be far preferable to further quota cuts.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, made known our major difficulties with the Commission's proposals to our Community partners and the Commission.  Some of our partners share our concern but others have difficulties for different reasons.  But it is clear that the negotiations for reform will centre on the Commission's proposals. <Col N="1465" /> We will be returning to this issue at the next Council on 11-12 December and the Dutch Presidency may arrange a further Council for the following week.  Given the divergence of views that exist around the table, it is not possible at this stage to anticipate the type of package that might attract a political consensus.  I can, however, assure the House that the Government will go all out to secure the necessary amendments to the Commission's proposals to fully protect the interests of this vital sector.</P>
    <P>Even if we achieved all our objectives, the agricultural and food sector and rural areas generally will still face major challenges. The new approach will undoubtedly accentuate the changes that have been occurring in recent years.  The percentage of the total employment in farming has been declining and the proportion of family farm income from non-farming sources has doubled in recent years.  Currently, farming accounts for just over 50 per cent of the incomes of those engaged in full-time farming.  Full account must be taken of these trends in the approach we adopt to agriculture and rural areas generally.</P>
    <P>This will require more attention to be devoted to rural development in the broadest sense.  This has been recognised at Community level both by the fact that the Commission has proposed a series of accompanying measures with its Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals and the ongoing Community assisted measures aimed at promoting rural areas.</P>
    <P>Here in Ireland we are already pursuing rural development under three broad headings, namely, the operational programme for rural development, which provides a framework of aid for infrastructural development, training, alternative farm enterprises, services for farming, forestry, research and development in food processing and small and medium-sized community enterprises; a new national structure for rural development, which has been developed from a successful pilot area scheme which ended in 1990 &mdash; this programme encourages rural development from the bottom upwards <Col N="1466" /> and the structures will link into the small and medium-sized enterprise funds under the operational programme and into other aspects of that programme and the Leader initiative which is the Community pilot programme based on support for locally created business plans.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme is, of course, a very important new programme, and I am very pleased to announce to the House that 17 Irish rural development groups are to receive EC assistance under the Leader programme which could amount to £21 million.  The purpose of Leader is to encourage groups in local communities to organise themselves and to draw up plans for the development of their own area.  Proposals to the EC must embrace an overall plan for the area and they must be practical in relation to activities. Activities undertaken by communities include vocational training, assistance for employment, rural tourism, development of small firms and craft enterprises and the marketing of local produce.  I am particularly pleased that so many Irish groups have been successful with their proposals.  The total investment to be undertaken by the 17 groups is about £70 million in the next two years.  The EC will contribute about £21 million and up to £14 will come from the Exchequer.  I am greatly encouraged by the response of so many groups from all around the country to the Leader initiative.  We can build on the enthusiasm and willingness of successful groups and, indeed, all who submitted plans to the EC to exploit the potential within their localities for enterprise, the generation of wealth and the creation of jobs.  I will shortly be meeting the groups who did not succeed in getting funding under Leader to discuss how they should move forward with their plans.  I have some ideas to put to them.  These types of programmes are essential to the support of rural societies.</P>
    <P>The package of accompanying measures which has been proposed will of course, assist the adjustment process especially if, as we are proposing, they <Col N="1467" /> are fully funded by the Community.  But they will not redress the problems facing many rural areas.  We must retain a viable agriculture in the Community and put in place additional socio-structural measures to underpin rural regions.  The forthcoming European Council will be addressing the level of the Structural Funds from 1993 onwards.  Part of these increased funds can I hope, be devoted to additional rural areas initiatives.  Turning to the food sector and the major challenges facing that area even if we get the adjustments that we are seeking to the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals, the agriculture and food sector will still face major challenges in the years ahead.  In our main sectors, beef and milk, production patterns have been reinforced by the availability of Community price supports.</P>
    <P>The Government are pursuing a policy to strengthen the sector to meet the challenges posed by Common Agricultural Policy reform, the likely GATT outcome, and the advent of the Single European Market.  The Government and State agencies involved are working strenuously to maximise the industry's contribution to the economy.  This is being done by providing the support and encouragement, both financial and otherwise, which the industry needs to ensure it is in a position to supply food of the type and quality demanded by the consumer and to produce and sell that food competitively.</P>
    <P>The food industry, along with other sectors of the agricultural economy, will have to address the situation they will face under a reformed Common Agricultural Policy and a freer trade environment. For far too long, the food industry has relied on commodity trading and the protective shelter provided by market and price support systems.  The industry must make a decisive shift towards more market-led production. We must urgently develop a market driven approach for all our food products. The food industry, as with any other industry will depend on the quality of the strategic decisions it makes and the speed <Col N="1468" /> of its reaction to changes in the marketplace. In this new environment these decisions must be led by market considerations and must be taken at all stages along the food chain from farm gate to retailer.</P>
    <P>A programme of investment amounting to £113 million has brought about major development in the food processing industry and extensive modernisation of facilities.  This investment was channelled through the FEOGA guidance fund and substantial capital grants from the IDA.  In the three-year period since the reform of the Structural Funds was undertaken, over £44 million in FEOGA processing and marketing aid has been made available to the Irish food industry.  Another £20 million was also provided through national aid.  This investment has brought out substantial upgrading of plant, increased processing capacity and greatly enhanced food quality and hygiene controls.  The net result of this strategic investment is that Irish processing facilities for the major food sectors now compare favourably with those of our competitors.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is still tremendous scope for penetrating the markets on our doorstep.  The European market gives us access to almost 340 million consumers.  I urge those in the industry to move quickly to exploit the potential of this market and develop the industry.  If we do not quickly avail of the opportunities there is a risk that these markets will be taken over by producers from the emerging central and eastern European democracies.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the Uruguay Round will open up increasing opportunities for trade expansion and economic growth. We should approach this determinedly so that we can participate in this important growth area.  My objective is to ensure an improvement in and better co-ordination of the promotion of Irish agri-food exports.  I will be devoting my full attention to this in the weeks ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also know that in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government have agreed to develop a national <Col N="1469" /> development programme for the agri-food sector having regard to the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT negotiations and the report of the policy review committee.  Although we do not yet know the detail of the outcome of the negotiations, I have already told the farming organisations that preparatory work must commence immediately so that we will be prepared for the likely support and trade environment that will obtain up to the end of the century.  I intend to set about this task without delay.</P>
    <P>If we can get the approaches right, then we can take advantage of the developments in world trade.  Some switch away from intervention towards direct payments should underpin producer incomes while, at the same time, help to make policy more transparent and also allow the industry to counteract the tendencies that have reinforced our seasonality and other problems.  A system of aids related to extensification with realistic criteria and to an agriculture which is more environmentally friendly should be to Ireland's advantage.  Our agriculture is already extensive and mostly grass-based. Policies geared towards rural development will help to stabilise and revitalise rural areas threatened with economic decline.</P>
    <P>This will require a major Community effort.  It is in the interest of all in the Community that the effort is made and is successful.  Without it, environmental action will be pointless and an important element in our social fabric and family farm structure wil be lost forever.</P>
    <P>Achieving the balance will not be easy. In the short to medium term a policy based on lower prices, less market support and more direct payments could, if the payments are to give realistic compensation for the changes, be significantly more costly for the Community than the existing policy.</P>
    <P>However, there would be a benefit for the consumer and this would have to be taken into account in the national equation.  Increased budgetary expenditure on direct payments could be <Col N="1470" /> accommodated and balanced by consumer benefits.  Most certainly the guideline for agriculture expenditure in the Community will have to be renegotiated in the new situation.  If we are to agree on a revised policy for agriculture and food for the rest of this decade, then we should at the same time lay down the permanent Community budgetary framework in which this is to operate.  If that is done correctly and fairly, then we can get a better balanced agricultural policy for the future.  But if we do not approach the question of Community financing and of compensation in an equitable way then we will fail to achieve the type of agricultural policy that all of us wish to see in place, one which among other things protects the family farm.</P>
    <P>Finally, increased funds for socio-structural measures along the lines proposed by the Commission and further assistance from the increased Structural Funds from 1993 onwards can contribute significantly to maintaining the viability of rural regions.</P>
    <P>The months ahead are crucial to our development but I am confident that our concerns can be accommodated if the Community are realistic in their approach to the negotiations.  I am determined that our case will be fully stated, that we will, through our development plan for agriculture and a new marketdriven approach, achieve a settlement which will position us well to maximise the benefits to be derived from the new Europe and greater markets which will obtain post-1993.</P>
    <P>I urge the House to support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, time sharing is necessary because of the constraint put on the debate by the Government.  I really think it is unsatisfactory that a debate of this importance should be <Col N="1471" /> organised in such a way that, unless time were split, not more than six or seven Deputies from the principal Opposition party could speak whereas something like 25 want to speak.</P>
      <P>This is not a debate in which one can say all the needs to be said in ten minutes, but even splitting time only half of those who want to speak can contribute.  We proposed that the time be extended so that we would sit until 8.30 p.m.  This would not have interfered with Government business but it was not agreed. Either there were not enough Fianna Fáil Deputies who wanted to speak and they did not want to be shown up or, alternatively, they would not even keep a House.  That they should frustrate our having adequate time for debate is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is room for argument on the Government's tactics concerning cohesion and seeking additional funds. From my experience, one thing is clear, ultimately the willingness of the richer and more central countries to help a country like Ireland is heavily influenced by our performance in relation to other issues.  At my first one-to-one meeting with Helmut Schmidt when he was Chancellor and I was Foreign Minister the first question he put to me was, &ldquo;I know what the European Community does for Ireland but what does Ireland do for the European Community?&rdquo; A very blunt question and a not unreasonable one. I answered that question in positive terms by citing strong Irish support for the European Commission and for the integration of the Community, political and economic, support for the expansion of the role of the European Parliament, the rapid expansion of our aid programme at that time and, consequently, our willingness to contribute to the largest EC aid programme to which our partners would agree.  All that was important because in putting it to him I was able to convince him that we were a useful member of the Community.  The goodwill we have had from Germany, and other countries such as France, was helped by <Col N="1472" /> that and by our positive attitude generally.</P>
    <P>How have we sought in the past four years to earn such goodwill by showing a serious interest in the development of the Community?  What have our contributions been?  In his speech the only initiatives claimed by the Taoiseach related to specific Irish interests, the employment priority and cohesion.  He did not suggest that any ideas had been put forward in the past couple of years for the future development of the Community in a constructive way which would show our genuine concern for the future of Europe.</P>
    <P>Our Government have been notably negative on the European Parliament and are opposed to an increase in legislative power, despite the logic of the argument that the Parliament should have co-decision power where the Council votes by qualified majority, a point made earlier by Deputy Bruton.  The Government do not seem to have supported giving Parliament a key role in the appointment of the President of the Commission, although that was put forward by our Government as early as December 1975 at the Rome European Council.  The Government seem to see the appointment of members of the Commission as an extra bit of patronage to hang on to, ignoring the vital importance of ensuring a strong President, with a democratic mandate from the Parliament, leading a Commission, in the composition of which he himself has a voice and one which has the confidence of the European Parliament.  We seem to have gone a long way backwards since 1975 in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude to the European Parliament is apparently influenced by the lack of a serious role there for the Fianna Fáil Party.  They are linked to one other national and nationalist party in a small group without much influence in the European Parliament.  I believe that is why Fianna Fáil are negative in relation to powers for the Parliament. They see the Parliament in terms of national delegations, which is how the Gaullists see themselves there, rather <Col N="1473" /> than a Parliament with European parties. The view seems to be that Ireland, with only 15 seats, will be outnumbered, but of course everybody is outnumbered in the European Parliament, not just small countries.</P>
    <P>The Parliament works through a party structure.  The two major parties which between them dominate the Parliament and decide ultimately the decisions it takes &mdash; the Christian Democrats and the Socialists &mdash; are ones in which we are represented by Fine Gael and by the Labour Party.  Between us we ensure that the decisions which emanate from the Parliament, through those parties and their controlling position, are ones that do not contain anything unfavourable to Ireland.  The European Parliament is far more positive about cohesion than the Council of Ministers, in which Fianna Fáil place such confidence.  It is Fianna Fáil's own weakness in the Parliament which prevents them from seeking where the national interest lies.  In an issue of this kind party interests should not dominate the intersts of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>More broadly, this blindness has prevented the Government from even recognising, let alone proposing any action on, the filling of the democratic deficit that is an inevitable concomitant of the single currency.  A single currency requires an executive authority to determine and control the size of national budget deficits and it would be intolerable if such an executive, whether it be the Central Bank, ECOFIN or the Commission, were not to be a subject to full democratic control, which is possible only through the European Parliament where decisions are taken by majority.  A Minister cannot be responsible to his own Parliament for decisions on which he may be voted down; only the European Parliament can play that role.  The Government refuse to face this.  The Taoiseach's speech contains no reference to this aspect of the problem.  It is clear that they have totally failed to press the urgency of seeking a decision now on filling the democratic deficit that will be created by the establishment of a single currency. <Col N="1474" /> Had the Government pressed this issue, they might not have got immediate results but they would certainly have won respect for their principled stance and for the commitment to both integration and democracy.  This was an opportunity lost.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when he dealt with the criteria for participation in the single currency, significantly omitted any reference to the only criterion which could pose a problem for us, namely the 60 per cent debt GDP ratio.  His reticence may be understandable as a member, and later Leader, of a Government who trebled our national debt in five years and left the succeeding Government with a current annual borrowing level of 21.5 per cent of GNP on 1 July 1981.  It is unacceptable in this debate not to refer to this matter. The Dutch draft treaty of 28 October suggests in Article 104 (b) a modification of an earlier proposal on this matter and states that the ratio of Government debt to GDP may only exceed a reference value &mdash; 60 per cent is the figure proposed, apparently &mdash; if the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and steadily approaching the reference value.  That seems to be a softening of the earlier proposed criteria.  Is it one we can live with?  Has it been accepted?  We should be told this.  That the Taoiseach should tell us about other criteria and leave out any reference to the only criterion that matters is totally unacceptable.  We are entitled to be told where the negotiations stand on this point, which will determine whether we can or cannot join the single currency at the outset.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said the decision to make a transition to Stage III involving the single currency &ldquo;will be made by consensus&rdquo;. Does this mean that Britain is to retain a power to veto the move to a single currency?  I have not understood this from anything I have read in the press.  This point must be clarified in this debate.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said that the Government would wish to see Community voting on some specific areas of social policy continue to be subject to a requirement of unanimity, but he did not specify them.  What are these issues?  The <Col N="1475" /> Dáil is entitled to know.  This debate should be about specifics, but every specific is omitted from the Taoiseach's speech.  That is the kind of approach &mdash; no White Paper and the omission of the specifics &mdash; that makes nonsense of parliamentary democracy, about which the Taoiseach does not seem to care very much.  Here, as on other issues where the Government have a specific position, he has failed to tell the Dáil what that position is.</P>
    <P>On cohesion, there is a need to look at the system of matching funds, whereby the community requires us to match their funds in a 50:50 ratio or some other ratio. The effect of this has always tended to be damaging to us.  It means that if the Community comes up with a proposal which it is believed will be useful for Ireland, they inject some money and we are required to add to our spending, while at the same time the Community is rightly telling us that we should be reducing our spending overall.  It makes nonsense of the whole process.  What we need is a system under which the Community, where it decides there are useful things to be done in a country like Ireland, can provide the funds but not force public spending on the Government here, particularly as in some cases the pattern of spending that results may not be the optimum combination of spending.</P>
    <P>Large sums of money have been available for training but none for education, unless we can call education training, as we successfully did under the previous Government in terms of the vocational sector.  The pattern of spending between training and education is not that which we judge right, or even that which the Commission if they were asked for their view would judge right, but one distorted by a technical procedure in the manner in which Community funds are allocated. That must be changed in the interests of the Community and in the interests of Ireland.  I urge that action be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great privilege for me to contribute to this debate after <Col N="1476" /> such a significant European as Deputy Garrett FitzGerald, whom I believe will be recognised as one of the great Europeans of the second half of this century. Before he became a Member of the Oireachtas in 1965, Deputy FitzGerald was one of the great advocates of European unity.  He followed the dreams of people such as Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman and others.  I do not think even he could have anticipated how much would be achieved in that direction while he was a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Summit will mark another major step away from Irish independence. This is no bad thing.  We will exchange independence for interdependence. At the rate things are going, by the year 2021, the centenary of our independence, we will almost certainly be a member of a fully comprehensive united states of Europe.  It is important that interdependence is substituted for independence.  To me the word &ldquo;interdependence&rdquo; means opportunities, a diminution in international tensions and world peace.  In the context of that interdependence, I hope that the lowering of barriers and the diminution of tensions will have a significant effect on the Northern part of this island.</P>
      <P>The one thing we must not exchange our independence for is dependence.  In my view, society in this Republic has by political action already developed too great a dependency culture.  What worries me about the Government's approach to Europe is that there is too much of the begging bowl mentality.  It would be terrible if we were merely to transfer the negatives of our dependency culture at home to a dependency culture within Europe.  This would demoralise our country and kill its spirit instead of taking advantage of interdependence to open its spirit, seize the opportunities and rise to the occasion presented by the ever growing unity of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because our time in this debate is limited we cannot develop to any great degree the points we want to make. However, I want to say that I do not just want social cohesion or a better standard of living from European unity; I also want <Col N="1477" /> people to have a quality of life which is worth having.  I want the quality of the lives of Irish people to be improved in every respect.  This means first and foremost providing a future for all our children at home, something we have singularly failed to do since our independence. As each decade has passed our failure in this area has been all the greater.  Our first objective in the greater unification of Europe must be the provision not only of resources but also the mechanisms and structures which will enable the innate enterprise of our people to take off and not stifle it in the dependence culture which exists here at present.  I plead with the Government to minimise the begging bowl attitude and develop the enterprise and go-getting attitude which will lift the spirits of our people.</P>
    <P>I also want to see an improvement in the quality of the environment, an area for which I have responsibility on behalf of my party.  Very significant strides have been made in Europe in relation to the environment.  I hope the Government will give increasing priority not only to improving the environment here but to ensuring that the developing European Community gives a very high priority to environmental considerations so that we can say in a given number of years that Europe has as good an environment as it is possible for a developed society to have.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in this debate to matters such as agriculture, culture, the environment, transport, economics, currencies, etc.  However, no reference has been made to religion.  I do not suppose this subject should be imparted in any great depth into this debate.  However, Europe is the cradle of Christianity and of the three strands of Christianity &mdash; Orthodoxy, Catholicism and Protestantism.  We cannot separate religion from the quality of life.  I hope in the context of a developing Europe that the best tenets of Christianity can be developed.  One of the great differences I see between a prosperous European society and a prosperous American society is the social caring dimension, the <Col N="1478" /> social market philosophy of the Christian Democrats, of which Fine Gael form a part, which is the every person counts philosophy.  We cannot separate this from any ambitions we have regarding the quality of life in an ever growing Europe.</P>
    <P>As an island nation on the periphery of Europe, one of the major areas of concern for us has to be transport.  This area seems to have been neglected by the Government.  We have to somehow offset the disadvantage of peripherality for our industry.  We can only do this by having a very brisk and competitive regime for transport.  Yet our road transport industry is at an enormous disadvantage compared to the road transport industry in Northern Ireland and Britain where there are lower rates of VAT, excise, insurance, etc.  The last four budgets introduced by Fianna Fáil have not in any way improved the competitiveness of the road transport industry here, rather have they disimproved it in certain respects.  Moreover, our air transport and shipping costs are significantly higher than those of our competitors. We have no Irish distribution centre on the mainland of Europe which would facilitate small Irish industries in exporting to mainland Europe.  We need to have a major distribution centre on the mainland of Europe where Irish companies can base their advance products so that they will get to the market.</P>
    <P>Transport is an area which needs to be given much greater attention by this Government than other Government in Europe.  In a short number of years Britain will be linked to Europe via the Channel.  All the other countries on mainland Europe have a road link.  We are at enormous disadvantage in this respect.  We must not add to this disadvantage. We need to take steps urgently to remove the disadvantages and ensure that our transport industry can avail of the opportunities which will arise from greater liberalisation of European markets.  I believe that if we get our act together in relation to transport there will be job opportunities in Europe for Irish people in the areas of cabotage and road <Col N="1479" /> haulage.  However, we have significantly failed to address the issue of transport in recent years.</P>
    <P>When I had the honour of being a member of the Council of Transport Ministers &mdash; I was President of the Council for one period during 1984 &mdash; proposals were drawn up to eliminate the disadvantage in the transport industry over the following five years.  However, the Government changed in 1986 and that plan was not pursued; on the contrary, things were made worse.  Therefore, I appeal to the Government to immediately examine the position of our transport industry.  I am not just making a plea for the transport industry in which jobs can be created; I am making a plea for industry generally.  If we do not have effective, speedy, reliable and economic means of transporting our exports to the main markets in Europe we will suffer and will not be able to create anything like the number of jobs we need.</P>
    <P>Finally, we have heard much in relation to the quality of life and the social fabric in the country, and rightly so, but the social fabric of our cities in the outer suburbs and in the inner city is disintegrating in certain places.  I hope resources will be provided from Maastricht to rejuvenate our cities and to replace squalor and environmental obnoxiousness with quality.</P>

      <P>The number of beds in consultant staffed acute hospitals which are closed for the remainder of the year is 164.  This represents 1.35 per cent of the total number of acute beds available, which is approximately 12,000.</P>
      <P>The Government set the approved number of acute hospital beds at about 12,000 in 1990 and gave a commitment that, apart from the normal seasonal closures, this level of bed availability would be maintained during 1991.  This commitment continues to be honoured.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that health boards throughout the country are extending dramatically what she describes as normal seasonal closures? Is she aware that in the Mid-Western Health Board, in the second half of this year, 10,500 beds were closed?  That <Col N="1481" /> means that about 2,000 patients for elective surgery have been affected?  Would the Minister agree that to cut back on elective admission when we already have probably 30,000 on the waiting list will cause hardship?</P>

      <P>I put my answer in the context of the commitment given by my predecessor, Deputy O'Hanlon, that the bed availability throughout the year would be maintained at 12,000 and this continues to be the case.  The Deputy will be aware there are seasonal closures &mdash; a term which has been understood for many years, dating from times of staff unavailability, holiday periods and so on. I can assure the Deputy and the House that should there be any emergency or a need for a greater bed availability, as was the case during the term of office of my predecessor, the beds would be made available for such an emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos, 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medical Organisation is the approved negotiating body on behalf of general practitioners providing services in the general medical services scheme.</P>
      <P>In 1989, new three-year contracts were entered into by the health boards and individual doctors for the provision of services for medical card holders following negotiations at that time with the Irish Medical Organisation.  The new contracts provided for a change in the method of payment from a fee per visit to a capitation based system.  It also provided for a range of new and enhanced entitlements for doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The memorandum of agreement which formed the basis of these new contracts provided for a review of the first year's operation of the GMS scheme.  This was completed in February 1991 under the independent chairmanship of Mr. John Horgan and the recommendations of the <Col N="1483" /> review body in regard to certain pay issues will be paid in January 1992.  A further review of the contract is due to commence next March on completion of the three-year period.</P>
    <P>On the 30 September 1991 the Irish Medical Organisation formally lodged its &ldquo;Statement of Case&rdquo; with my Department for an increase in the level of all fees and other payments make to general practitioners under the present contract. This claim is being processed in accordance with agreed procedures and within the timeframe agreed with the organisation as an arbitration hearing will take place shortly.  While I am aware of the outcome of a recent meeting of general practitioners which was organised by the Irish Medical Organisation regarding their future participation in the GMS, I do not consider it would be appropriate for me to make any further comments on the issue at this time in the light of the earlier submission I made here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the Minister to her new portfolio and I hope we will have a proper relationship in this very important area of health. At least the Minister accepts &mdash; and my colleagues share the same concern &mdash; that there is a problem.  It is being dealt with by ongoing negotiations, but is the Minister aware of the consequences for medical card holders which arise from the statement made publicly by the representatives of IMO?  They said that if agreement was not reached with the Minister services would have to be paid for.  This is a dramatic statement for people who are in discussion with the Minister to make.  Is the Miniser aware of that statement and the consternation it has created?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everybody else in the land, I watch television.  I am aware of the outcome of that meeting.  It would be entirely incorrect for me, in the circumstances in which I have dealt with that answer, to make any comment while matters are being dealt with.  This <Col N="1484" /> evening I am having a courtesy visit from the IMO in my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate her on her promotion to the Department of Health.  Clearly, the Minister is aware of the terrible consequences for about 1,250,000 people &mdash; the medical card holders &mdash; who rely on the general medical service.  By virtue of the fact that they have medical cards, life is difficult enough.  Can the Minister assure those people and the House that she will abide by whatever decision is arrived at through arbitration?  Would she further agree &mdash; if the reports we are reading are correct &mdash; that if the IMO are seeking an increase in excess of 40 per cent this is a disproportionate demand to make on the State?</P>

      <P>I would like to thank both Deputy Ferris and Deputy Byrne for their good wishes.  My knowledge is gleaned from what I and any other person could gain from the media reports and the television reportage following that meeting.  I continue to say it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment one way or the other.  Certainly, I do not intend to gaze into a crystal ball and give a prognosis for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any contingency proposals to deal with a withdrawal of service in the event of this happening, because, as Deputy Byrne said, there would be in excess of 1,250,000 patients without service unless they have money in their pockets.  Does the Minister also accept that the terms of the 1989 contract were not honoured and that this is a major contribution to the <Col N="1485" /> militancy of the GPs in this case?  The practice grants were not honoured, the conciliation agreement in the 1991 agreement has not been produced and the drug budgeting proposals were ignored in the Minister's move to control drugs.</P>

With regard to contingency plans, I do not intend to enter into somewhat fevered anticipation with regard to what may or may not happen some months hence.  I am satisfied that I am correct in my assumption that it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this stage on this matter.

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that some doctors are earning in excess of £100,000 per annum from the scheme and that a 40 per cent increase is far too big a demand on the State?  Would the Minister agree that there seems to be incredible militancy within the IMO which nearly brought about a national rail and bus strike in the past month? Will the Minister guarantee that, because of the dispute because doctors were going to withdraw their services to CIE workers as well, she will accept as binding the findings of the arbitration board?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6, 70 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, provides for the payment by health boards of subventions towards the cost of maintenance of dependent people in private nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Before the Act can be commenced, regulations, covering a number of matters in the Act have to be completed. Work on these regulations is at an advanced stage, including the drafting of regulations to provide for the payment of subventions for eligible people placed in registered nursing homes.</P>
      <P>The new subventions will be paid by health boards subject to a means test and an assessment of the level of dependency or impairment of the person applying for a subvention.  The amount of the subvention paid in each case will vary depending on the means of the person and his or her level of dependency.</P>
      <P>Substantial expenditure on subventions to nursing homes under sections 26 and 54 of the Health Act, 1970, are made by the health boards at present.  An additional £0.5 million has been made available this year to health boards to assist with the implementation of the Act. The need for further additional funding to implement the Act is being kept under review.  It is my intention that the new Act should come into operation as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The development of new techniques, such as hip replacement surgery, has coincided with the growth of an elderly population and these, together with other advances in health care, have resulted in infinite demands being placed on finite resources.</P>
      <P>The waiting time for hip replacement surgery varies from centre to centre. While the longest waiting patients may experience delays of the order outlined by the Deputy, the majority of patients received surgery within a shorter period of time.  At St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh, for instance, the largest orthopaedic centre in the country, the average waiting period is four months.</P>
      <P>I should explain that the admission of a patient to hospital for hip replacement surgery is a clinical decision for the consultant in charge of the case.  Waiting lists are kept under review and priority is given to urgent cases.  If a patient's condition is causing concern it is open to his or her general practitioner to contact the consultant concerned in order to stress the urgency of the case.</P>

    <P>With regard to waiting times generally, the Deputy will be aware that the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group focused on the management and review of waiting lists and general strategies to improve waiting times for treatment.  The group recommended that: comprehensive, standardised, information be maintained and reviewed by each hospital concerning the numbers and types of patients awaiting admission; validation to establish meaningful waiting list data be adopted as a firm policy in each hospital; hospitals <Col N="1490" /> should carry out bulk postal reviews of waiting lists where patients have been on waiting lists for more than an agreed period of time; hospitals should target waiting lists by ensuring that explicit account is taken of waiting times in scheduling admissions including theatre list.</P>
    <P>The group have recently been reconvened and part of their new remit is to pursue the implementation of the recommendations in relation to waiting lists in the Dublin hospitals.  In addition, health boards and hospital authorities in the area outside of Dublin have been asked to consider the good practice recommendations contained in the report and to report back to the Department on their plans for implementation of the recommendations, including those in relation to waiting lists.</P>

I should like to put one policy proposal to the Minister.  In relation to delays of this kind for hip operations, is there not a case for an emergency approach which would involve hijacking &mdash; I deliberately use the word hijacking &mdash; the national lottery surplus for a limited period to clear these waiting lists?  Such a move would have the support of all sides of the House if the Minister agreed, and, indeed, it would have support throughout the country.</P>

There has been much talk over the last number of years but nobody has commented upon the increase from around 1,700 to over 2,000 in the greater throughput in those years.

Can the Minister reconcile the appointment exactly a year ago of a fourth orthopaedic surgeon backed up by an anaesthetist with the failure to provide the nursing staff to support them?  Would the Minister agree that in order to do something about waiting lists in the Mid-Western Health Board region to expedite operations it will be necessary to provide support nursing staff to specialist skills who are extremely difficult to get in the first place?

      <P>My predecessor gave agreement in October 1988 to the North-Eastern Health Board to dispose of 164 acres of land at Curraghbeg, Ardee, County Louth at a price of £225,000 to the company referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A condition of the sale was that a specific development must progress satisfactorily within a three year period, <Col N="1494" /> failing which the board would have the right to reacquire the property at the purchase price.</P>
    <P>Compliance with the condition will not become an issue for the health board until after 19 April 1992, the expiry date for the condition.  In the meantime, the Minister for Health has no function relating to the implementation of the agreed development on the site.</P>
    <P>The arrangements which were made for the sale of the property took particular account of the employment-creating purpose for which it was being acquired.  The number of jobs involved was to be approximately 200.  The specific provision under which the board may reacquire the land after 19 April 1992 at the original price, in the event of non-compliance with the specified condition, reflects the fact that this sale took account of all the circumstances surrounding the transaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

The Department took the advice of the health board and in turn decided to put in the proviso that in the event of non-compliance with the three year employment development plan they would have the option to buy it back. The expiry date is next April.  It is my information however that nothing has happened on the site in the interim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <P>I have no knowledge of what the political complexion of the health board was in 1988 but it is my information that the decision was based on local knowledge and that the understandable wish of the local community for job creation was taken into account. In turn, the Department of Health took the precaution of including the proviso that if the employment targets were not realised, which is the case at present, the land would revert back at the original price.</P>

(b) Pre-school and national school children in respect of defects noted at child health examinations. (c) Other persons adjudged by the chief executive officer of a health board to be unable to provide a particular service for themselves without experiencing hardship.  The Department have issued guidelines to the health boards concerning specialised orthodontic treatment, which I keep under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines were introduced to ensure that the resources for such services would be used to the best advantage and for those most severely affected or handicapped.  Orthodontic cases are categorised by the guidelines into the following priority groups in descending <Col N="1498" /> order of handicap: Category A.  The most severe cases, e.g. cleft lip and palate, somewhat less than 1 per cent of all children. Category B.  Cases with severe functional handicap, e.g. marked disproportion between the upper and lower jaws, and, therefore, teeth, about 6 per cent-8 per cent of children.  Category C. Non-handicapped cases but having a definite need for treatment, e.g. masticatory and/or speech impairment, about 12 per cent-16 per cent of children.  A further category, sometimes called D, caters for the simpler type of case which can often be treated at primary care level by a non-specialist having sufficient skill and experience.</P>
    <P>The position regarding orthodontic services in the Eastern Health Board area was outlined fully by my colleague, Deputy Chris Flood, Minister of State at the Department of Health, during the Adjournment Debate of 17 October 1991 at columns 919 to 922 of the Official Report.  I am satisfied that, with the investment of additional funding for the third year, significant improvement is being made in the delivery of the orthodontic services in the area.</P>
    <P>Primary dental care services are available to school children throughout the health boards.  In the Eastern Health Board area the method of delivery of these services varies between community care areas.  Some areas operate a demand based system under which care is provided to children whose parents seek it. A number of other areas are changing from a demand based system to a system based on need for care.  With this system children in selected classes in the schools are examined in the schools and any necessary care is provided at a designated clinic.</P>
    <P>Routine care is also being provided for adults in the health boards' clinics from the additional moneys provided by my Department for the purpose.  In the six months to 30 June 1991 the Eastern Health Board provided a total of 4,600 additional treatments for adults.  In addition, emergency care is available both to adults and children on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> My Department are at present reviewing the provision of both the dental and orthodontic services to ensure that the significant resources being committed to them are utilised in the most cost effective, prioritised and equitable way.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the Minister to the House to answer questions for the first time on health matters and wish her well in the future.  I should make the comment that she will after a time come to be as disappointed as are those of us who are members of health boards, with the jargon used in some of the replies given to questions.  May I ask her specifically if she is aware of the total number of people waiting for treatment in the Eastern Health Board area at present?  Is she further aware that, even though this is the third year in which extra funding has been made available, the waiting period is as long now as it was three years ago, if not longer, and that most parents have found it is cheaper in the long run &mdash; in some cases they have remortgaged their houses &mdash; to attend a private orthodontist to get the treatment which their private medical practititioner deems necessary?</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind comments.  In relation to the jargon used, this was one of the first things which struck me when I went to the Department; but, of necessity, I will have to learn some of it as it is medical in nature.  I have a wet towel around my head each night trying to learn all these terms, but I am managing.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of waiting lists, as the Deputy has said, this is the third year in which additional funding has been made available.  As the House will be aware, we had difficulty in recruiting qualified professional people.  I agree that the question of orthodontic treatment for children requires constant vigilance.  I hope we will continue to make progress and report a better rate of take-up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware that the dissemination of good information and education are of vital importance in controlling the spread of AIDS. Substantial funds are being invested by my Department in a major national media campaign with the specific objective of raising awareness about HIV and AIDS.  The campaign is by means of television and radio advertising.  The basic message is that HIV is continuing to spread, that there is no room for complacency and that knowledge and understanding minimises the risk of the spread of HIV.  This campaign is designed to heighten in intensity around World AIDS Day, 1 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the ongoing campaign about HIV, I intend to launch tomorrow a new video which has been produced by the health promotion unit of my Department. The video will deal with knowledge <Col N="1502" /> and information about AIDS and HIV; transmission of HIV and its prevention and acceptance, support and compassion for persons with HIV and AIDS.  The video uses a mixture of drama, graphics and narrative to illuminate many aspects of HIV and AIDS.  It will be suitable for educational purposes with community groups, adult education classes and health care staff.</P>
    <P>An additional element of the ongoing campaign has been a pilot programme involving convenience advertising.  The health promotion unit of my Department have been disseminating a series of messages about HIV and AIDS by means of a campaign in third level colleges during 1991.  These messages relate to what HIV and AIDS are, how HIV is spread and how risks of transmission can be reduced.</P>
    <P>Following positive evaluation of the pilot programme, I have decided to continue the campaign in third level colleges and to extend it into a number of women's health centres and entertainment facilities.</P>
    <P>The development and dissemination of comprehensive AIDS resource materials by my Department and the Department of Education for all second level schools represents a core element of a comprehensive information-education programme on HIV and AIDS.  In-service seminars for teachers have been conducted nationwide, involving the health promotion unit, the Department of Education and regional health board expertise. Feedback from this schools' programme is very positive and affirms the importance of resource materials for use in our schools.</P>
    <P>A revised information leaflet entitled <i>AIDS The Facts</i> has been prepared by the health promotion unit and is being disseminated nationally at present.  This leaflet provides comprehensive information on HIV and AIDS, how to avoid infection and high risk behaviour.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive education-information approaches I have outlined are an integral feature of the Government's AIDS strategy which was announced recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply.  I welcome the proliferation of leaflets and videos. However, will the Minister agree that the most effective media would be television and radio advertising?  The stop-go attitude which has emanated from the Department recently is inadequate in the light of the alarming escalation in the spread of the HIV virus.  While I appreciate the campaign on television leading to World AIDS Day, will the Minister confirm whether the campaign will continue on an ongoing basis, which would be the most effective means of tackling this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We plan to continue the ongoing campaign, although I do not know at what level.  Obviously, graphic videos, television and radio advertisements have a part to play.  Interestingly, research has shown that, while such advertising is effective and must be continued and emphasised, it does not often reach the most vulnerable people who need it.  Research pinpointed the need for the convenience type advertising, which I mentioned, which has been available in areas in third level colleges &mdash; enhanced leaflets and all the other activities which we will be continuing and extending.</P>

I have been amazed at the <Col N="1504" /> range of their activities and the professionalism which has developed between them and the relevant section in the Department of Education.  During my four and a half years in the Department of Education it was very interesting to note the strong links which we established with the Department of Health at ministerial and official levels.  I worked on various programmes, particularly the AIDS programme for second level schools, with great thoroughness with the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, and his officials.  We produced what is regarded in Europe as a good programme.  However, it needs to be evaluated and in January the Departments of Health and Education will do a very intensive survey of the schools on how the programme has progressed. There will be an enhanced in-service programme for teachers and, if necessary an evaluation and adaptation of the programme.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that given the nature of Irish society and the legal position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the availability of condoms, she is fighting the battle against AIDS with one hand tied behind her back, as it were?  Would she not agree that all the knowledge and information about the transmission of the HIV virus is not of much use if there is difficulty in obtaining condoms?  Finally would she agree that, as a person can buy a packet of Aspros across the counter to cure a headache, condoms should be equally accessible in order to save lives?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, as the new Minister for Health, to look at the latest advertising campaign by RTE on AIDS?  RTE manage to conduct this campaign without a single mention of condoms despite the fact that the effectiveness of condoms has been recognised by the World Health Organisation as well as by Dr. James Walsh, head of Ireland's national AIDS programme.  It is recognised that condoms play a part in fighting the battle against AIDS and the HIV virus.  Would the Minister agree to look at the advertising campaign to see if more direct reference can be made to the use of condoms?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>While the campaign is advertised on RTE it is a Department of Health campaign.  Dr. James Walsh, the AIDS co-ordinator, was very much involved in the production of that advertisement and I will be glad to pass the Deputy's comments to him.  The advertisment is graphic and dramatic and is very arresting in its message.  I intend to continue the tone I have set for this debate because it is an area in which one has to be sensitive but also entirely sensible and frank.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that many of her efforts to promote information are not getting through to groups where the instance and risk of HIV is greatest?  Low educational standards have been reached by many of these people and they are not accessible <Col N="1506" /> to television advertising.  Would the Minister not agree that outreach workers are needed to get through to those people?  Would she agree that a recent survey showed that half the people with the virus were engaging in unprotected sex and that that clearly illustrates a failure of the information campaign in a very important respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right, and that is the point I made to his colleague, Deputy Creed, when he asked if we were going to continue with the present media campaign through television and radio.  Research has shown that such campaigns very often do not reach the people for whom they are intended.  While the campaign is necessary in order to increase awareness and has graphic arresting qualities, it will not be successful if it does not reach the people for whom it is intended.  The video to which I referred will soon be available in outreach centres which are accessible to young people who have left school and joined programmes such as Youthreach and other community groups.  We will continue to advertise in a comprehensive and graphic way.  This is a very serious issue and I welcome the fact that there is consensus on it across the House.  I hope that the open and frank discussion which I continue to bring to bear on this problem will be of help to those who need it.</P>

The <Col N="1507" /> health services in Ireland are generally recognised as being of a high standard.

As I am not aware of the reference to the interview with my predecessor, Deputy O'Hanlon to which the Deputy referred, I will not comment on it.  With regard to the specific case alluded to by Deputy Allen, it refers to a comment made by Dr. Yvonne Doyle who is now working in the new UK health system.  She obviously has great admiration for the way the UK health system is progressing.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to informal carers, that is, relatives and families of dependent people.  It is not possible to estimate the number of carers needed to provide care for dependent people.  However, it is known that approximately 66,000 people are providing care to elderly people and a significant number are caring for people with physical and intellectual disabilities and the mentally ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> A Carers Charter prepared by the Soroptimists International of the Republic of Ireland was presented to my Department in April this year.  The charter has been circulated to the health boards for consideration in the preparation of their plans to develop services for the elderly, the mentally ill and people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Less than 5 per cent of the 66,000 people providing care qualify for the carer's allowance.  Does the Minister agree that this shows the extent of the State's commitment to the work that carer's are doing?  Would the Minister further agree that many families providing care for a relative, including the 900 families waiting for residential places for children with an intellectual disability, are stretched to breaking point and that circulating the health boards with the document, <i>Charter for Carers</i> is not urgent enough to tackle their needs?</P>

      <P>No instruction has been issued to general practitioners requiring them to reduce the availability of prescribed drugs to medical card holders.</P>
      <P>In the course of the 1990-91 review of the GMS contract, it was agreed between the Irish Medical Organisation and management that, as part of a co-ordinated drugs strategy, indicative prescribing budgets would be determined for all doctors in the GMS scheme.  It was further agreed that these budgets would be based on the best information available and that they would be refined and adjusted annually.  This process has now commenced and indicative figures were circulated to doctors for a six month period this year, prior to the circulation of the annual targets for 1992 which will be determined following discussion with the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
      <P>The cost of prescribing in the GMS has risen from £79.5 million in 1986 to an estimated £118 million in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the 1992 target figures for individual practices will take account of <Col N="1512" /> the total amount available for the GMS and standard costs having regard to panel size and demography.</P>

Would she further agree that it was totally hamfisted to issue a directive in August about drug reductions which showed the usage for May only, and not for June and July and to expect doctors to make massive cuts in prescribing levels?  Finally, would the Minister not agree that asking doctors to cut their prescribing rate for public patients by 30 per cent discriminates between public and private patients in their access to medical care?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 22 together.  The new contract between health boards and general practitioners for the provision of services to medical card holders which was introduced in 1989 changed the method of payment from a fee per visit to a capitation based system.  One of the principles behind the revised method of payment was to allow the doctor sufficient time to deal with individual patient problems in a comprehensive manner, thereby maximising the ability of general practice to meet the health needs of medical card patients.</P>
      <P>The new contract extended the range of special services in respect of which general practitioners are paid an additional fee and which otherwise would have to be provided in a hospital setting. Annual subsidies are paid in respect of the employment of practice nurses, which enable general practitioners to provide a broader range of care services.</P>
      <P>General practitioners are also entitled to fees for visits outside normal working hours.  Arrangements are being put in place to allow for the payment of fees for special services and out of hours visits which are provided by a doctor within a group/partnership or rota arrangement in respect of a patient of another doctor within the particular arrangement.  It is hoped that this will further encourage the development of group/partnerships and rota arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much aware of the important role of general practitioners in the provision of a comprehensive and cost-effective health service.  The measures which I have outlined were introduced to encourage a more comprehensive service at primary care level and the question of whether further initiatives are required in this area will be considered as part of the forthcoming review of the general <Col N="1515" /> medical services scheme, which is due to commence in March 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was not specific to medical card holders.  It was a more general question about the clogging up of the accident and emergency services and the provision of an alternative. Is the Minister aware of the Hynes report which showed that 20.5 per cent of those in attendance at accident and emergency units were considered to be inappropriate to the accident and emergency services? Would the Minister agree that one way to attract those people back to the part of the system in which they should be involved &mdash; the service provided by general practitioners &mdash; would be to encourage larger practices to open for longer hours and more flexible times so that if someone required one or two stitches then he or she would not have to join the queue at an accident and emergency unit but could go to a general practitioner? That is the message that I was trying to get across &mdash; an alternative system to ease the huge waiting lists and prevent the clogging up at accident and emergency units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a very sensible point.  The GMS contract provided for the payment of additional fees to general practitioners in relation to several other forms of service, which are all included in the list.  A review of the position will commence quite early in 1992.  I agree that what the Deputy has said is common sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the 1989 agreement provided for development grants for doctors surgeries so that doctors could do the kind of work that would keep people out of accident and emergency units and that her Department failed to honour the commitment given in that contract? Would she not further agree that there is enormous scope for general practitioners to handle cases that now end up in the hospitals, among them the cases of stable <Col N="1516" /> disabetics, angina cases and blood pressure-related complications?  Could the Minister make this an area that she will examine as a matter of urgency?</P>

      <Col N="1573" />  1.  to fully support moves towards a single European currency in conjunction with support for the Spanish insistence that a new Treaty contain a legally enforceable guarantee of adequate continuing financial support for poorer regions and states along the lines that already apply within the Federal German Constitution;</P>
    <P>2.  to support the democratisation of the European Community by giving extra powers to the European Parliament including the appointment of the President and membership of the Commission, and the introduction of a directly elected Upper House of that Parliament with equal representation of all Community states along the lines of the United States Senate;</P>
    <P>3.  to support proposals for the extension of majority voting in the Council of Ministers in order to speed up the Community decision-making;</P>
    <P>4.  to simplify the proposals for co-decision making between Parliament and Council, which are so complicated in their present form as to constitute a potential barrier to progress;</P>

    <P>6.  to support the development of a security and defence competence within the Community Treaty, so as to ensure that all states in Europe have a say in matters affecting their future and the preservation from external threat of the political union that is to be created;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are well aware that moving towards economic and monetary union is a long and difficult process. There was a great deal of planning and of negotiating and now it seems that we are due for a great number of decisions from Maastricht.</P>
      <P>I am not here today to grapple all the technicalities in relation to matters such as the formation of the European Central Bank, the proposed European Monetary Institute as an interim measure, or the composition of the ECU &mdash; whether it be hard, soft or otherwise.  What is important is that economic and monetary union is coming and that it will mean big changes for all of us.  I should like to take a ground level consideration of some of those changes.  There are many other changes that cannot be dealt with in the short time available; they are for another day.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, economic union will have four main effects: it will mean freedom of movement for people, goods, services and money &mdash; namely, the internal market; it will mean competition policy to protect free markets; we will have a common policy for structural and regional developments; there will be a shared set of rules governing national budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make that happen, the Delors <Col N="1575" /> report stated, economic and monetary union must go hand in hand.  Monetary union will mean, irrevocably, fixed exchange rates and ultimately, a single European currency.  It is a stagewise process, but already there is fairly free movement of capital and by the end of next year Ireland will really have said goodbye to its exchange controls.  So it is happening, and next month at Maastricht some more of the practicalities will probably be ironed out, moving us closer to the transitional second stage.</P>
    <P>As most people would understand it, Ireland stands to gain from further integration into Europe.  The general thrust of the Delors approach to union &mdash; more growth and more stability &mdash; is probably in everyone's interest.  The Delors report also proposes a kind of union that will promote balanced development and reduce regional disparities.  That is exactly what we are looking for.</P>
    <P>However, the reality of pre-Maastricht Europe in that there are still big regional disparities.  From the point of view of the smaller player, such as ourselves, Greece or Spain, it is still a matter of too much integration and not enough cohesion.  Let me spell out that distinction.  The larger member states are more concerned with monetary matters, achieving convergence of inflation and interest rates and of budget deficits.  The less well off countries want a policy that will help create real convergence or cohesion among all EC countries in terms of economic growth, employment and standards of living.  But the Commission always has shared the larger members' view that existing cohesion mechanisms are adequate.  In part that is an attempt to alleviate the fears of the larger member states about how much this process will cost them.  But it has led to a lack of real debate about what a united Europe could mean ultimately and has left us with a very restrictive model of European Monetary Union.  If the spirit of the Delors report is to remain intact, this split between monetary and economic policy, between the haves and have nots has to be addressed at Maastricht.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> A lot of studies on the possible impact of the proposed convergence criteria suggest that European Monetary Union will not contribute to the raising of relative living standards in the less developed regions like Ireland.  The debate has been dominated by the larger member states. Indeed there is a marked reluctance by them to enter into binding commitments on economic and social cohesion measures for the one obvious reason, that it will cost them more.  We must not be deterred from pursuing our objectives &mdash; there may be an ultimate cost on those best able to bear it &mdash; but how can the basics of European Monetary Union be achieved without commitment of support and resources to the less well off?</P>
    <P>Our objectives can be easily summarised. I see them as twofold: first, the commitment from the Council and Commission that they will act positively within the framework to develop cohesion mechanism to satisfy Community integration; second, a commitment to concrete measures to be taken now in favour of cohesion &mdash; for example, improvement of the Structural Fund, new Community programmes and a different attitude to the Community resource system.  There can be cause for legitimate concerns this time.  Maastricht is the place and time to address these concerns.</P>
    <P>President Delors is reported as saying that work will begin in January on the detail of enhanced Structural Funds, but Structural Funds are part only of the answer.  We are looking for increased cohesion.  They are a very small part of the Community budget, which budget itself accounts for 1 per cent only of Community GDP.  The reference in the Cecchini study to Structural Funds as compensation for victims of the single market does not sound much like a commitment to positive regional decelopment. Ireland, backed by several other member states, has already, proposed stronger provisions for social and economic cohesion for consideration at Maastricht.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed convergence criteria, as they stand, Ireland and other countries with high debt levels could be <Col N="1577" /> disadvantaged.  It is certainly the case that without a lot of hard talking about more concessions we cannot expect European Monetary Union to improve relative living standards in the less developed regions.  We must be actively involved in monetary union.  Opting out is not a choice for us and would not save us from a shift of industrial investment to the centre as the single market is completed.</P>
    <P>In the report of the Commission &ldquo;One Market, One Money&rdquo;, the costs and benefits of European Monetary Union could be partially estimated only.  EC simulations suggest that the global impact should be positive.  They indicate also that Ireland will benefit, but not as much as the EC as a whole.  One sector that should gain from European Monetary Union is that of manufacturing industry. A single currency would mean that companies would not have to hedge their bets on shifting their exchange rates or pay for foreign exchange transactions with the EC.  We must remember that 75 per cent of our exports and 67 per cent of our import trade is with other EC countries, which would entail large savings all round.</P>
    <P>Integration of financial markets would make life easier for investors and commercial borrowers as competition in the financial services sector increases.  Even with the ERM the possibility of devaluation will keep Irish interest rates at a premium.  Of course, all the other members states stand to benefit also. That is as it should be.  Greater access to the European market should be good for most of Irish industry, but we had better be ready as well for the increased competition it will bring.  It is also a hard fact that the manufacturers' gain could be the bankers' loss in that they would lose on foreign exchange.  They could also lose business to the Pan-European banking conglomerates, cashing in on economies of scale.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the present draft Treaty, conversion to a single currency could be a two-speed process.  If by the end of 1996 there are seven member states who are both willing and eligible in terms of their economic health, then <Col N="1578" /> the process of monetary union could move into a third and final stage.  It would be in our interests not to get left behind at that point.  That is one of the key provisions of the Dutch proposal.  If at a certain point in time, namely, 1996, there are seven countries willing and eligible, I have to say to the House that implies acceptance of the concept of the two-speed European Community.  I do not think that is desirable for us.  Certainly it is desirable that we be part of the fast track; to be anywhere else certainly would be to our disadvantage.  The concept of a two-speed Europe could be a very dangerous one for some member states, particularly for the less developed regions of the European Community.  For example, it could reduce the focus on economic convergence and lessen the resolve to increase the impetus for the less developed regions to catch up with the richer EC member states.  I would prefer that the figure were eight rather than seven.  With six well off member states, it should not be too difficult to attract one further state to come on side. But if circumstances prevailed in which more than one of the less well off states had to be brought on side to accept the whole package of stage three going ahead, that would be a better safeguard for states such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our rates of inflation should not be a problem, but our Exchequer borrowing might be against us.  The GDP/debt ratio is set to be at 60 per cent; ours does not look that good at 97 per cent at present. But then neither does Italy's at 93 per cent or Belgium's at 128 per cent.  What it boils down to again is that we must fight for concessions; I mean fight, not plead.  Ours is a debt accumulated during the late seventies and early eighties and has very little to do with our present economic capacity.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Maastritch Summit will set about ensuring that countries like ours, with a falling GDP/debt ratio, can qualify.  Under the present draft Treaty that is very much a matter for interpretation. Much depends on the interpretation of the proposed words: &ldquo;If the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and <Col N="1579" /> steadily approaching&rdquo; this value of 60 per cent.  If strictly required to get that ratio down to 60 per cent of GDP by 1997 Ireland would have to run a budget surplus of the order of 2 per cent of GNP over a period of years.  Obviously, that would be very onerous and fiscal policy would exert a contractionary influence that would offset all of the estimated benefits of European Monetary Union. Our current plans envisage a borrowing reduced to 1.5 per cent of GNP by 1993. That policy would see our GDP/debt ratio fall steadily.  At the pace envisaged we would still be over the target of 60 per cent, but I suggest that the target would be in sight.  We can take it that we would qualify, but can we be so sure that the borrowing pattern will be in accordance with our stated objectives?  Recent statements seem to undermine the possibility of achieving those stated objectives.</P>
    <P>The current proposed convergence terms could place Ireland and other high debt countries at a serious relative disadvantage.  The need to reduce high debt ratios would entail a restrictive fiscal stance.  The end result would be fewer benefits from European Monetary Union than for the EC as a whole.  We need to get flexibility agreed in that area to help us in our transition to the proposed GDP-debt ratio.  There is also some uncertainty with regard to the criterion of Government budget deficit, put at 3 per cent of GDP.  An unusual alliance of Britain and the Commission appears to have won the argument for looser sanctions on excessive budget deficits foreseen for EC states after European Monetary Union.  Sanctions, including fines, denial of access to EC funds to help the lesser developed regions catch up and bans on borrowing from the European Investment Bank, seem almost certain to be dropped.  We do not know.  It is the kind of important information that should be shared with us in this debate.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about one more thing. We are not asking for gratuitous handouts, and we are not expecting any.  Economic policies under European Monetary <Col N="1580" /> Union will remain largely decentralised, but in the interests of coherence two binding rules have already been agreed: there will be no monetary financing of public deficits, or privileges for public authorities in the placement of their debt; and member states with budget difficulties will not be bailed out automatically. What constitutes an excessive deficit and what sanctions should apply will need to be worked out at Maastricht.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about making our case at next month's Summit we have to be seen to take responsibility for ourselves. We have to accept that under European Monetary Union a better standard of living will not just happen.  We have to make it happen.  That means more productivity, stimulating more investment for more job creation.  We need to be making changes that create that kind of climate.  We need changes in our taxes, and we need to think hard about any increase in capital or corporation tax as the competition for new investment hots up.</P>
    <P>Under the present terms of the draft Treaty conversion to a single currency could be a two-speed process.  If by the end of 1996 there are seven states who are both willing and eligible, in terms of their economic health, then the process of monetary union could move into a third and final stage.  I still recommend to the Taoiseach that it should be eight rather than seven states.  It would be in our interest not to get left behind at that point.</P>
    <P>To enable the benefits of European Monetary Union to be distributed fairly it will be necessary to have the parameters of the distribution process clearly committed to the Treaty proper. The practical benefits promised by the union cannot be left to post-Treaty consideration or decisions to be taken at some future meeting.  I suggest that a declaration of support is not the way forward. A declaration is simply a political aspiration.  We need a protocol to the Treaty amendment because it would have legal standing.  I recommend that such a protocol be pursued by our delegation at <Col N="1581" /> Maastricht.  It should include the following points.  The financial resources allocated for economic and social cohesion objectives should be significantly increased.  Significant increase should also take place in real terms as regards Structural Funding.  Special funding should be provided for the environment and for trans-European networks programmes.  The eligibility of what attracts support in objective I countries should be widened.  There should be a concentration of more support for cohesion in less developed regions.  That means that there should be a greater percentage for the peripheral states.</P>
    <P>The intervention rates should be changed and there should be more flexibility. At the moment they run from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, but they should be gauged at 100 per cent and thereby relieve the need for the additionality demand on our Exchequer.  That additionality causes very great difficulty. It is contrary to the spirit of European Monetary Union to say that you can have half the price of the project while at the same time the provision of the other half from Exchequer resources causes considerable disruption to the budgetary system.  The system of own resources should be made more progressive, taking better account of the relative wealth in contributions to the Community budget. It is the same situation as the rates support, but in reverse.  In strict equity a relatively poor economy should not have to give the same percentage as the richer countries, who are giving from their surplus. I am not talking about the begging bowl mentality.  It is our entitlement in the context of cohesion and convergence.</P>
    <P>The protocol should provide that State aids to the productive sector should be monitored to achieve a balance in assistance. The richer countries in the Community are giving 60 per cent State aid. How can we expect the IDA to compete? State aids are an integral part of cohesion and competitiveness and should be provided for in the protocol attached to the Treaty to enable us to compete and thereby achieve better convergence and cohesion in all our interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The debates which are taking place around Europe in various countries have a number of features in common.  The Europe to which Maastricht turns has been irrevocably changed in recent times and there are social characteristics now which did not exist a few years ago.  It is a Europe of far more unemployed people, with dislocated rural regions, with millions of poor people, with migrant workers who as long ago as 1973, when Dr. Hillery was a Commissioner, could have looked forward to a draft charter of rights for migrants.  It is a Europe filling more and more with hate towards migrant workers. It is a Europe of people, something we should remember.</P>
      <P>I want to make a point that is very important to me.  It is reflected in a way in the first paragraph of the Labour Party amendment, which states that we deplore the fact that this Parliament has no Foreign Affairs Committee to discuss matters of international policy.  It has no fully fledged European Affairs Committee. It has a Committee on Secondary Legislation with limited terms of reference. There is a sense of impotence in what we say here.</P>
      <P>Anybody who travels in Europe is aware of a growing alienation of all Europeans from all parliaments, all politics, all civilised expression of opinion and difference.  I would argue that Maastricht will open without there being a consensus on the future of Europe but rather a moral acquiescence in something that might happen.  That raises a number of questions.  The greatest problem facing the European Community is this widening gap between language and reality. We have listened to so much of it.  Many writers have written about this.  Political scientists refer to it as banalities.  When a word means nothing, you can bring in lots more words and they need not mean anything either.  An example is the phrase &ldquo;firing snow at the wind.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this gap between language and reality, certain fundamental principles begin to slip away.  People might not be willing to accept from me a suggestion that there is a serious set of issues which <Col N="1583" /> flow from what I have described but it is in the works of Bridget Laffan, Rory O'Donnell and others where, for example, they raise questions about an old fundamental in economics &mdash; how can a free market deliver a regional policy?  It is no wonder the language has an abstract quality because this has never happened in human history, anywhere, in any political system during any period of history. I will come to this in a moment.</P>
    <P>If you want to understand this point it is very simple; you can have an integrated market and gain the benefits of economies of scale, location of industry, higher volumes of output and sales and concentrated costs of distribution &mdash; they are certainly there &mdash; but you do so through concentration.  After that you can say there are social costs associated with all of this and you propose to pay for them by distributing a kind of compensatory payment to the regions you have robbed of people, resources and infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that Maastricht will open with a broken promise.  Maastricht which is structured on a set of rhetorical pillars and which is very shaky as to what its precise agenda will be, will have immediately before it the broken word of the Single European Act debate which said that the integrated market would take place coterminously with a social Europe, the social action programme and the whole question of social policy.  It was explicitly asked of those who drafted it and argued in favour of it: are you saying that the social policy will come as a corrective or residum of economic benefit? They said no, it occurs at the same time and it is to correct the intergration of the market and benefits, at the risk of suggesting something that was unattainable. The public of Europe know that the social provisions of the Single European Act have slipped further and further into the distance.  Trust was broken in a contract made with the citizens of Europe.  A new offer is now being made to the citizens of Europe with a new set of terms and new pieces of language, cohesion.  The Taoiseach regards his <Col N="1584" /> experience at Maastricht as so important for survival into the political future that he has included some unusual things in his speech about what he aspires to on behalf of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Preparing for Maastricht in this country is a kind of rhetorical excursion, a ritualised presentation of spectacle and a manipulation of anxiety and reassurance. It draws on the kind of now well developed dramaturgy we have come to expect from the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey.  It is that you create a kind of anxiety in the country that we could do dreadfully badly at Maastricht unless we have our usual man going there.  Fianna Fáil put it to us that they saved not only themselves but all of us by saving the Taoiseach to go to Maastricht for us.  I am sure this relieved anxiety in every village in Ireland.  There was also the reassurance of the speech by the Taoiseach this morning which I have in front of me.  It is the same kind of speech we have come to expect for a long time.</P>
    <P>Why do I use this language?  I was not simply throwing this in for effect; it is not new.  I once attended and exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci's drawings in Florence in which it was very clear that when he was working for the Medicis the people who were in favour of the drawings and those who were not were in a different part of the ceremonial order. This is what is happening in regard to Maastricht.  We will be told it may all fall apart but then it will be saved and anxious heads of state going into the Summit will be replaced by a peaceable photograph afterwards of the heads of state jostling each other to make sure that no excessively tall person is alongside a person of the same stature as me.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to where I began. This exercise in dramaturgy and rhetoric purports to speak about the life chances of people in Europe, employment, investment and monetary, when the Taoiseach and the other people who speak here know that nothing they will <Col N="1585" /> do at Maastricht will contain investment or make people, guided by the marketplace, want instinctively to go for the sake of being &ldquo;communitare&rdquo; to the most remote regions of Europe.  For the millions of unemployed in Europe this will be a further exercise in alienation, a language with no consequences or moral action, which is simply guff.</P>
    <P>Maastricht will become, as we will see it unfold on television and as it will be handled by the media, a manipulation of symbols presented on the point of failure, rescued at the last moment for success, the return home &mdash; the last stage of the heroic journey &mdash; and statements in the House.  Will one job have been created? Will one principle of social policy have been advanced?  Will there be a single new principle of foreign policy towards aid, trade or debt?  Will women feel more equal to men?  Will people who did not have access to education suddenly be allowed to advance themselves?  Will there be a new advance in European culture? Will people on farms who do not know where their children will work know what their future will be in agriculture? The first delegations to Europe used to say we are a small but proud country.  Would they be proud to have a 19 per cent unemployment level travelling in front of them now?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party amendment is deliberately couched to cut through this kind of exercise in dishonesty, symbolic manipulation, abuse of language, vanity, alienation and action which has so driven the public to despise politics.  When I worked in America I used to wonder why black people in poor districts used to put up with it and not revolt.  Some of them burned their houses to the ground and left but many did not.</P>
    <P>Why do people put up with this?  They do so because they are beaten into a kind of acquiescence by this abusive language in which nothing can be described any more.  They keep hoping that if a person is good for himself he might be good for the country and is the kind of man we <Col N="1586" /> should be sending abroad.  Perhaps he is the right kind of man to send abroad.  It is pathetic, hopeless, alienated, divided and disorganised.  For example, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed have written an open letter to the Taoiseach, a copy of which I received this morning.  This asked the Taoiseach whether, if as expected, he signs a new European Treaty, the Irish Government will be asking for a commitment to full employment in that Treaty.  Did it occur to anyone to make such a demand?  We could define unemployment in terms of a certain percentage level.  I want to be practical as well.  I want to pay tribute to the Institute for European Affairs for its publications, for listing the issues and encouraging public debate in a way the Government did not.  The previous Government were not of much help in preparing for the Single European Act either.  Can the Taoiseach tell us what the Irish Government are seeking to compensate for the effects of the integrated market since they have acknowledged that the existing instruments &mdash; regional policy, social policy and the European Regional Development Fund &mdash; have failed to bring about any effective convergence in recent times between the rich regions and the poor regions?  It is rather silly to say that a doubling of the resources for instruments that do not work will achieve an even greater compensation and effect the greater integration being proposed.</P>
    <P>In relation to my point about the location of industry, if you want to have a balanced Europe, economically and socially, you need not only to provide incentives in the regions but, rather like what was done with RTE, you need to cap incentives in the centre so as to drive funding towards the regions.  There is no statement from the Irish Government that this will happen.  There is the usual good old Fianna Fáil flirtation that if there is money in it any principle can be up for auction, such as that in relation to the Western European Union which we <Col N="1587" /> slithered off in recent times without any accountability to this House.</P>
    <P>In his contribution this morning, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>Some partners see the Western European Union as an integral part of European Union with organic links to the Union.  Others would prefer it to stand in an autonomous relationship but taking guidance from the Union. Some have concerns about the implications of all this for NATO.  The different approaches have not been reconciled to the point where we have a clear view of what might go into the Union Treaty.  But I do not think that we should rule out a relationship between the Political Union and the Western European Union.  I am thinking, for example, of cases where the Western European Union could have a peacekeeping or humanitarian role, where, as was agreed in regard to humanitarian aid to the Kurds, Ireland and other non-Western European Union members could act separately, in parallel and in co-operation with those partners who are in Western European Union. </P>
    <P>That is a rather meaningless statement because I do not know whether he is talking about after or before enlargement of the Community.  But whatever way he means it, he should read the basic statute of the Western European Union which requires it to consult with NATO before it does anything.  The Western European Union, founded in 1954, is required by article 4 of its Treaty to consult NATO in all military operational matters.  Therefore, an organic link between the EC and the Western European Union could involve Ireland in an organic link to NATO.</P>
    <P>There is a continual vagueness and I want to speak about the irritating part of it.  I find it unconvincing when people speak about a Europe of the people.  We are able to read census data, we know <Col N="1588" /> how many people were in different countries before we talked about Treaties. But people are concerned with participation in Europe.  For example, people want to be involved in institutions and decision-making about their lives, job, farms, the quality of the environment, culture and so on.  However, domestic parliaments are alienating their publics from politics.  In this House we do not have a Foreign Affairs Committee or a European Affairs Committee.  When the Taoiseach stands up and speaks for 45 minutes we are given the impression tht he is thinking somewhere in the recesses of his brain that perhaps Western European Union might not be a bad thing.  The arrogance of it all, the lack of democracy.  After Maastricht what there should be is this.  Decent people who stand for values which assist the unemployed and the poor, who believe you can have economics and a social policy but that you must specify your social policy and make your budgetary economic union instruments the instruments of achieving that, should be able to make progress.  However, what is involved is a con job &mdash; the idea of suggesting that the broken contract of the SEA can be upgraded to a full grade bogus European suggestion and that with economic and monetary union you can almost, with a prayer and a wink, get the social benefits the people are seeking.</P>

      <P>The man who wrote the letter to the Taoiseach on behalf of the unemployed had something to say.  I know the association of the unemployed in this country of economic failure are not regarded as a social partner and they will not be invited to Government Buildings. They have their equivalents all over Europe.  If I were going to Maastricht I would be asking for a clear employment creation strategy; for new directives for <Col N="1589" /> instruments of regional policy; for an industrial policy that cost the rich countries something; for job creation initiatives built around ecologically responsible projects; and I would be advancing a foreign policy that used the concept of security, that took into account the changed nature of international politics and its shift from an east-west axis to a north-south one.  I would be responsible in relation to overseas development aid and I would have a different view on GATT and on trade.  Instead of that, we are dragging ourselves along to Maastricht and coming back imagining that we are a kind of a Napoleon limping home to the village, which would be as good as description I could think of for the Taoiseach's return.</P>

      <P>First of all, I was very interested in the contribution by Deputy M. Higgins who is an eminent lecturer in UCG.</P>
      <P>A successful conclusion to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union will, I am sure, have a beneficial effect on the business life of this country.  Specific new areas of competence are being proposed for inclusion in the new Treaty which will result in the development of Community policies in a number of areas of economic importance.</P>
      <P>In the new Treaty the Community will, <i>inter alia,</i> be committing itself to the harmonious and balanced development of economic activities, to the maximum convergence of economic performance and to the raising of the standard and equality of living.</P>
      <P>In the area of Community external trade policy new Treaty articles will have the effect of streamlining the operation of EC trade policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> third countries. Ireland has benefited greatly from its Community status in the world trading environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly important that we are being represented at this vital meeting <Col N="1590" /> by an experienced Taoiseach who has immense parliamentary and political knowledge acquired over a very long period in public life and who has a knowledge of the needs and requirements of the Irish people.  The needs of the people are very evident in the points put forward by Deputy Michael Higgins and I know of them also from my representation of a rural constituency in Roscommon.  In developing Europe special consideration must be given to the most peripheral part of Europe, the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As an integral part of an economic Community of more than 320 million people &mdash; significantly increased in a business sense recently by the establishment of the European Economic Area, which joins the peoples of the EC with the member countries of the European Free Trade Association in an economic grouping &mdash; Ireland is a member of the largest trading bloc in the world.  The opportunities for trade and for overall economic development which arise from such membership have been substantial and will greatly increase from the dynamism which will result from a more closely integrated economic Community.</P>
    <P>One particularly important new area of infrastructural development which will be covered in the new Treaty is the commitment to the establishment of Transeuropean networks.  The intention is for the Community to plan, foster and assist in the development of EC-wide infrastructures in the areas of telecommunications, transport and energy. Ireland has participated in the drafting of the Treaty articles in this regard with the particular aim of ensuring that the needs of the peripheral regions are to the forefront when projects are being developed in these sectors.  It is likely that the agreed text will indeed reflect this approach and that there will be a commitment to the provision of Community support for network projects.</P>
    <P>The draft Treaty also lays considerable emphasis on the need to strengthen the <Col N="1591" /> scientific and technological bases of Community industry to enable it to become more competitive at international level. The intensification of this kind of Community activity is something that Ireland welcomes very much.</P>
    <P>We have been to the forefront of research activity in many areas of scientific and technological activity and this expertise has been a significant plus factor in the development of indigenous industry and is an important element in attracting foreign investors to establish here.  I am particularly happy to see that the draft Treaty focuses on the encouragement of research and technological development activities in small and medium-sized undertakings, research centres and universities.  It is in these areas that Ireland can derive maximum benefit from Community support.  The Government's programme for science and technology development is now well established and well placed to complement Community activity.  These are just some examples of the impact which the results of the EPU negotiations will have on Irish business and the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Over the past months media attention has focused, naturally enough, on the major political developments which will shortly be coming to a head in Maastricht. One might be forgiven, therefore, for not remembering that 1992 is fast approaching.  However, I can assure the House that work has been continuing to ensure that none of those, whether politician, businessman or man in the street, within the Community or outside it, who view the internal market as an irreversible process, a reality, will be disappointed.</P>
    <P>For over 30 years the European Community has been striving to abolish the physical, technical and fiscal barriers that separate each member state from the others.  This process was substantially accelerated six years ago with the establishment of a legislative programme <Col N="1592" /> designed to eliminate specific obstacles to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people within the Community and complete the internal market by 31 December, 1992.  That deadline is now 13 months away and agreement has been reached on 75 per cent of the internal market programme of 282 measures. Areas where major progress has been made include technical harmonisation and standards, the opening up of public procurement and of air transport, merger control, insurance and the liaberalisation of capital movements.</P>
    <P>With just 399 days left to the 1992 deadline, the Community as a whole is increasingly aware that there is very little time left to adopt finally the remaining 78 White Paper measures and to implement them and the measures already in place. The Community clearly has a major task ahead of it if the remaining measures are to be agreed on time, but I am confident that the commitment and the political will are there.</P>
    <P>When the 6th Report of the Commission on the implementation of the internal market programme was published in June last, there was a total 89 measures awaiting adoption.  Of those measures, 11 have since been finally adopted, one has been partially adopted and common positions have been agreed on five.</P>
    <P>The measures finally adopted include: a Regulation setting up a permanent system for the collection of statistics on the trading of goods between member states to operate from 1 January 1993; a Directive on the control of the acquisition and possession of arms; a Directive eliminating barriers to trade in machinery, together with several Directives relating to animal, fish, and plant health.</P>
    <P>The progress in these last areas is particularly reassuring given that at the time of the June progress report they accounted for almost one third of the outstanding measures.  Furthermore, while there have been no new formal adoptions in the area of indirect taxation, <Col N="1593" /> work on those proposals is progressing apace.  I can assure the House that further significant achievements will be recorded before the end of the year, bringing to fruition the considerable efforts of all member states over the past 11 months.</P>
    <P>The huge patchwork quilt of regulations necessary to remove the barriers to the movement of people, goods and services is now almost complete.  Ireland has played its part in bringing about this transformation and I am glad to see that Irish industry has made considerable efforts to face the challenge of this new market place and to seek the potential benefits that will exist in it.</P>
    <P>Turning now to Economic and Monetary Union, the forthcoming European Summit in Maastricht will make a further significant milestone in the political and economic integration of Europe.  The decisions taken at Maastricht will bring to fruition a concept that has been in gestation for more than 20 years &mdash; since the six Heads of State and Government of the EEC, as it then was, decided that a plan be prepared to create, in stages, an Economic and Monetary Union.  The objective then was to underpin the achievement of full customs union and the establishment of the Common Agricultural Policy at that time.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the steps being put into place at present to move further along the road to Economic and Monetary Union derive their momentum in part from the evolution taking place in moving the Community from a Customs Union to a Single Market and from the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy now underway.  The first plan for Economic and Monetary Union was prepared and published in the Werner report of 1970.  Tentative steps in the early 1970s along the road set down in the Werner report included the establishment of the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; in 1972 to provide a framework within which the exchange rates of the currencies of member states could be managed with less uncertainty and the establishment <Col N="1594" /> of the European Monetary Co-operation Fund in 1973.</P>
    <P>The international oil shocks of the 1970s, however, to which Community countries reacted in a defensive, protectionist rather than in a more far-sighted co-operative manner, postponed further decisive action in creating a region of economic and monetary stability until the establishment of the European Monetary System together with the European Currency Unit in 1979.  By that stage Ireland was a full, participating member of the EC and was fully and enthusiastically involved in the establishment of the European Monetary System and in becoming full members of the system from the outset.  We decided then that it was in our full national interests to participate in developing a more economically integrated and cohesive Community.  The stance we took then has been vindicated by subsequent developments and we have a chance now to build on what has been achieved in considering the further steps to political and economic union.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already, the European Single Market programme, officially adopted in 1988, was another significant step on the road to economic integration.  The programme has as its objective the removal of all barriers to trade &mdash; both direct and indirect &mdash; within the Community, by the end of 1992.</P>
    <P>Up to the start of this year the progress made in implementing the programme had already given a major boost to investment and employment creation throughout the EC.</P>
    <P>Together with the very sound fiscal, income and structural policies adopted by the Government from 1987, it has contributed greatly to a rate of private sector employment growth in this country over the period to April 1990 which the Governor of the Central Bank recently referred to as &ldquo;one of the strongest ever recorded in the history of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The other major contribution to this <Col N="1595" /> performance was the exchange rate stability and associated low inflation rates which, combined with complementary economic policies under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> resulted from our membership of the European Monetary System.</P>
    <P>The contribution of these factors to Ireland's good economic performance in recent years are particularly significant in the context of the present debate on European Monetary Union.  Associated with the Single European Act, which laid the legislative basis for the achievement of the Single Market by 1992, were two other factors which are of major significance for Ireland in the context of the present debate in the House on the issues that will come forward for decision and discussion at Maastricht.</P>
    <P>The first of these was the fact that, under the Act, economic and social cohesion was established as a primary objective of the European Community. The Act defines the objectives of economic and social cohesion as the harmonious development of the Community, the reduction in disparities between the various regions and the backwardness of the less-favoured regions.  This is of vital importance for our region in the west which is the most peripheral in Ireland and in Europe.</P>
    <P>It incorporates the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund) into the EEC Treaty for the first time and defines the task of the fund as helping to redress regional imbalances.  Under the new draft Treaty these provisions will be significantly strengthened.</P>
    <P>The second significant factor associated with the Single European Act in the context of the present debate was the decision to double the level of Structural Funds to be made available to the least developed regions of the Community, including Ireland by 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> The decision to provide additional financial resources to help the less-developed countries of the Community provided concrete evidence that the more developed countries of the Community are prepared to provide significant resources to help the less developed regions of Europe to help themselves.</P>
    <P>It was, perhaps, also a recognition that the removal of the barriers to trade which the Single Market will bring about may contribute to the further centralisation of investment in the richer, central regions of the Community unless countervailing measures are taken.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall at the present time that, five to six years ago, the member states of the Community decided to adopt the Single European Act in advance of any commitments to the doubling of the Structural Funds. That significant increase in resources for regional development purposes came after the terms of the Act had been agreed by member states.</P>
    <P>Ireland, of course, has done exceptionally well from the additional EC resources provided for development purposes. We have done so because we took the attitude that the solutions to our social and economic problems lay in our own hands and that EC support, while important, was complementary to our own efforts.</P>
    <P>Our destiny remains in our hands.  This approach was spelt out in detail in our <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> which set out a comprehensive range of development measures which aimed, with the aid of Structural Funds support to help this country to close the gap in living standards with the richer Community countries.</P>
    <P>Arising from it, we agreed a Community support framework with the Commission &mdash; in essence a broad strategy for development &mdash; which together with additional developmental initiatives supported through the Structural Funds, provides for a total of some £9 billion of <Col N="1597" /> development expenditure over a five year period to the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>Over £3 billion of this investment will be provided through the Structural Funds.  Development programmes have been developed for each of seven regions in the country with full local participation and form an intrinsic element of the national programmes prepared.</P>
    <P>Ireland has done well from the increased level of EC transfers under the Structural Funds.  We account for some 5 per cent of the less developed regions of the Community but have been allocated some 10 per cent of Structural Funds' commitments over the period to the end of 1993.  This will amount to some 2 per cent of Ireland's GDP over that period.</P>
    <P>The transfer of EC resources at such a substantial level is a practical recognition and a reflection of the very serious unemployment problems faced by Ireland compared with other member states at present.  Further initiatives in this area can be expected.</P>
    <P>In the case of industrial development, a five year investment programme of some £1.5 billion, including related training and educational investment, was agreed with the Commission and is now well under way.  EC financial transfers will account for over 50 per cent of the total cost of the programme.</P>
    <P>The improvement of the marketing performance of Irish firms is receiving specialist attention under the programme. The scope for such improvement has long been recognised.  A major boost will be given to investment in marketing activity by firms by doubling the financial resources available annually for market development purposes through An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>Over £100 million of expenditure on supporting the marketing development plans of firms will be supported by the Structural Funds at the highest contribution rate over the period to 1993.</P>
    <P>This will represent the highest ever level of State support for the development of marketing in Irish firms.  The <Col N="1598" /> objective will be to achieve an 80 per cent increase in the exports of indigenous firms by the mid-nineties.</P>
    <P>Among the measures that have been developed are: a special development programme aimed at identifying new commercial opportunities for Irish firms in selected regions of the Community which are showing above average economic performance; a new programme to develop the marketing capability of a limited number of firms which demonstrate the potential to break into new markets &mdash; the programme, through the use of consultants, assists in devising appropriate marketing plans for firms and will provide substantial financial assistance towards their implementation; and an intensive marketing development programme for small Irish firms concentrating on the domestic market at present.  These firms will be helped on both a group, regional and sectoral basis to consolidate their positions on the domestic market and lay the foundations for moving them on to become exporting firms.</P>
    <P>A special effort is being made under all the Structural Funds-supported programmes in Ireland to help develop our own less-developed regions such as the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>These regions are faced with very severe difficulties in the context of a Europe moving towards greater economic integration.  They are at the very western periphery of a Europe in which economic political forces are increasingly directing investment towards the centre and further east.</P>
    <P>The rich tapestry of community life in these regions cannot simply be left to the unabridged vagaries of the market-place. The Government will not allow this to happen; adequate account will be taken of the external forces associated with development.</P>
    <P>At present, the various operational programmes in areas such as industry, <Col N="1599" /> tourism, transport and rural development are placing special emphasis on putting developmental investment into those regions.  More is required and we will need to ensure that the resources made available for regional development purposes after the Maastricht Summit continue to place emphasis on the development of our less-developed regions.</P>
    <P>On balance, Ireland welcomes the moves towards economic and monetary union now being put into place.  There are a number of reasons for this.  First, the completion of European Monetary Union will provide, in due course, exchange rate certainty within the Community. In the past, widely fluctuating rates of exchange have significantly damaged the growth prospects of Irish business and have contributed to a trading environment which has been hostile and uncertain.  This will change under European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is also likely that, as exchange rates become irrevocably fixed, interest rates will converge and reflect the influence of the stronger EC states.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity of wishing the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, every success in these vitally important discussions in Maastricht.  I have great confidence in the competence of the Taoiseach to ensure that we get the best possible deal in the best interests of the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>I genuinely believe that agriculture has been relegated to the out-patient department at the Maastricht conference next month.  The intellectual debate has gravitated towards the creation of economic and monetary <Col N="1600" /> union, political union, the internal market and so on.  The proposed reform of the common agricultural policy has been sidelined, and unless there is a very strong farming/rural flavour injected into the proceedings in Maastricht, nine million EC farmers, including our own, will have cause to remember this conference.</P>
      <P>I believe Ireland has a much better future inside an integrated Europe than outside it.  However, we must assess our strengths and weaknesses as a nation. Europe has utterly changed since we first joined the Community.  The jigsaw is larger and the component parts are smaller. Hence the great fear that many people have that Ireland and other poorer EC member states like Greece and Spain will be smothered in the expanded integrated Europe.</P>
      <P>In my short speech I wish to draw attention to the stated reluctance of the European Community to agree to the transfer of a specified amount of wealth from the rich countries to the poorer peripheral regions.  I should like also to retrace the steps back to the time the Treaty of Rome was signed when millions of words were spoken and tons of paper used to emphasise the commitment that peripheral regions would enjoy an increase in prosperity consistent with the expected rise in living standards on mainland Europe.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it perfectly clear that the first and most fundamental prerequisite for the development of the peripheral regions is that the so-called centre expands and grows because crumbling debt-ridden economies in, for instance, Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands would be the kiss of death for the poorer regions.  The Treaty of Rome contains an implicit commitment to reduce the disparities in living standards between the rich and poor regions, but I have to confess that did not happen.  This imbalance must be redressed at the Maastricht Summit and it will be a failure if this objective is not achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To simplify my argument on a day <Col N="1601" /> when there has been little simplicity, the European Community intended that membership of the Community would confer benefits and responsibilities on participating nations in more or less the same way as an ordinary group water scheme is constituted.  Once participants are accepted into such a scheme, irrespective of whether they live one metre from the main pipeline or one mile down a boreen, the capital costs are divided equally amoung all members.</P>
    <P>The European Community's regional policy must confer additional benefits on areas on the periphery of Europe.  This aid should be of prime influence on specific regions.  Onerous responsibilities should also be placed on local committees, communities, development groups and national governments to ensure that this aid is well spent consistent with the objective of maintaining an adequate population in remote areas.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as a free lunch. This does not mean that we should pay people to do nothing.  People, irrespective of where they live, are entitled to an opportunity to develop their God given talents in pursuit of an aspiration to live meaningful lives in a modern society.</P>
    <P>The dynamics of regionalisation are complex and quite difficult to understand. The United States of America is highlighted as a successful nation of states which can shift resources to its weaker states with some success.  This is done by means of an automatic trigger mechanism which ensures that financial resources are transferred to a particular region without an application having to be made or negotiations having to take place.  However, on the other side of the equation we have the Soviet Union which would appear to be going in the opposite direction to the current European Community proposals.</P>
    <P>Some Irish people believe that European integration will mean that Ireland will become the County Leitrim of Europe, with no disrespect to that county.  Many in the west believe that their region will become the Achill Island <Col N="1602" /> of Europe if specific guarantees are not given to transfer financial resources from the rich to poor regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should support the Spaniards on this issue of Maastricht.  The management of the new Europe must be one thousand times more efficient and effective than anything we have seen before.  There is a growing fear in less well off countries that even if the new regional policy is weak wealthier national governments will subsidise their own poorer regions.  This procedure, if allowed, would catapult Ireland back to the third division and we would soon have the status of a Third World country.  A Community policy on cohesion is vital for Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have made reference to bad EC management. EC management of the Common Agricultural Policy was nothing short of scandalous.  Intervention aid was given across the board.  For instance, a farmer near the port of Rotterdam could feed 4,000 head of cattle on cheap cereal substitutes from outside the European Community without the cattle ever having to eat a blade of grass.  This Dutch farmer received the same benefit per animal as my neighbour in County Galway who had only 20 cattle.  A sheep farmer in Norfolk in the United Kingdom with 10,000 ewes received the same ewe premium per animal up until very recently as a farmer in County Roscommon with 100 sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intervention stores were allowed to be filled with produce the consumer did not want and the taxpayers of Europe were reluctant to finance them.  However, the new Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals would penalise the guilty and the innocent.  For instance, it was not the production of the small farmers of Ireland which overburdened the intervention system.  The most repressive proposal of all is to limit compensation in <Col N="1603" /> the poorest areas of Ireland and apply a stocking rate level of 1.4 livestock units per hectare.  This would mean that for many small frmers with a stocking rate above this level the choice would be a stark one.  Either they would have to do without the compensatory payments or sell part of their herd so as to become eligible for grant-aid.</P>
    <P>For the Irish commercial farmer the future is very bleak.  It appears that there are no proposals to curb the importation of cheap cereal substitutes from outside the European Community.  Therefore, European Community farmers living within a short distance of huge intervention ports, such as Rotterdam, will have a decided advantage over Irish farmers.  We have decimated every conceivable research and advisory function for farmers that one could imagine despite the fact that we do not have the expertise to produce the food products required in Europe.</P>
    <P>I shall now turn to what I call the European Community waffle industry where the European bureaucrats go out of their way to ensure that no ordinary person understands what is happening. There has to be a better and more meaningful way of explaining what is happening to the people for whom this is intended.</P>
    <P>I issue a word of warning to all those who believe in European union that the referendum to ratify whatever is agreed at Maastricht will not be a cake walk. Even now, at a time when there are 260,000 people out of work, high income tax and interest rates and poor housing conditions, many ordinary people are asking what has Europe done for them. It is very important, therefore, that a new deal is concluded for Europe.</P>
    <P>I have said many times before that the Government have no clear-cut strategy for Maastricht.  That said, however, I wish the Taoiseach and the Government well.  This conference is as crucial as any of those in which we are likely to participate.</P>

      <P>This debate is not and should not be about the past.  Surely we can learn from the past and our past relationships with many of the countries in the European Community.  This debate is primarily about our present and future.  The question we should be asking today is how can we shake the tides of history rather than hold them back.  We can make two choices in our approach to the Maastricht conference which, when we get rid of all the Eurospeak and jargon to which Deputy Bruton made reference this morning, can be put quite simply: we can embrace fully the opportunities and challenges opening up for us as a small country in a positive, non-whingeing, begging bowl at the ready way, or we can pretend to ourselves that the European Community and membership of the European Community should be treated like a large cash and carry business out of which we take what cash we can get and for the rest of the time allow ourselves be carried along by our wealthy partners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. M. Barrett Mr. M. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most grateful that the Chair has afforded me the opportunity to raise this very serious matter regarding which there is wide concern.  This is in relation to illegal car park attendants, known as the cap men, who operate on the streets in Dublin each evening, at weekends and on days when there are sporting events in Dublin. These men direct motorists to park their cars illegally on double yellow lines and on footpaths, in fact in any part of the street where there is room to park a motor vehicle, irrespective of what traffic hazard it is causing.  These individuals have no authorisation from any Government Department, including the Department of Justice, Dublin Corporation or the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána are very much aware of this operation <Col N="1605" /> where these men direct motorists to park and take money from them, giving the impression that they are operating in a legal manner.</P>
      <P>I have raised this issue over the past ten years with all the Garda Commissioners but I got a very negative response.</P>
      <P>I have also raised it with the roads and traffic committee, Dublin Corporation, and I recall one superintendent in charge of the traffic division indicating that these men were part and parcel of the culture of Dublin.  However, I am very concerned at what I heard on the Marian Finucane programme, on Tuesday, 26 November. Several people contacted the programme to complain about the operation of these individuals who are intimidating motorists for money.  One women stated that when she came into Dublin to do her shopping, she parked her car and on returning later that evening one of these individuals prevented her from getting into her car.  She discovered that she had no money to give him.  She went to a shop to get change and gave him 40 pence but he still would not allow her into her car. She then had to go back to the shop again and ask the man whom she knew to escort her to the car in order to prevent this individual from intimidating her.  There were several complaints of this nature on the programme.</P>
      <P>On her way home she called to the local garda station, which covered the area where the individual was operating. She got a very negative response from the Garda who informed her that it would be almost a waste of their time trying to apprehend the individual in view of the fact that if he was summoned and taken to court he would be fined only £4 and would be operating the following day on the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most important that legislation is introduced to clear the streets of Dublin of this nuisance.  If a person goes on the public streets to collect money without an authorisation from the Garda, he or she will be prosecuted.  The same applies to any charitable organisation.  I cannot <Col N="1606" /> understand why the Garda will not prosecute these individuals for collecting money publicly on the streets in front of gardaí.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to take up this matter by introducing the necessary legislation and by instructing the Garda to deal with the question of the collection of money without any authorisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that, where breaches of the car parking regulations in Dublin come to notice, they are dealt with appropriately by the Garda and traffic wardens. As the House is aware, I made road traffic law a priority and the enforcement of parking regulations is a very important element.  For this reason, I have made available to the Garda traffic corps the necessary resources in personnel and equipment to remedy the situation.</P>
      <P>At present the Garda traffic corps in Dublin have six tow-away trucks at their disposal which have proved to be most effective.  A measure of their success is that there has been more than a four fold increase in the number of vehicles towed away because of illegal parking; it increased from 1,340 in 1988 to 6,187 in 1990.  To further improve the efficiency of the tow-away service and to accommodate the ever increasing number of vehicles a new compound on the north side of the city was opened recently and already its effectiveness is bearing fruit.</P>
      <P>The complement of traffic wardens now stands at 148, an increase of 75 over the past 18 months.  These wardens play a crucial role in the overall management of traffic control in the city.  The number of fines on the spot notices issued has increased from 390,000 in 1989 to 470,000 in 1990; the vast bulk of these are for parking violations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is still a problem in relation to illegal parking we have made a significant impact on it although we have some way to go.  As a result of the increase in parking law enforcement and better awareness of the <Col N="1607" /> problems caused in the daily life of the city by illegal parking, we can look forward to the day when the attitude of motorists will change in much the same way as attitudes have changed in regard to drink driving.  As the chances of getting caught rise so does voluntary compliance. As an aside, in relation to drunk driving offences, the House may be interested to note that approximately 25 people lose their driving licence every working day as a result of drink driving convictions.</P>
    <P>Turning back to parking law enforcement, I reiterate that the Garda and traffic wardens cannot be on every street in the city.  At the end of the day it is up to motorists to observe the law and make the city a better place to visit and in which to live and work.  In so far as the question of individuals directing motorists to parking spaces is concerned &mdash; I know that this practice may occur in certain city centre locations &mdash; it should be noted that the onus rests with the motorist to satisfy himself, or herself, that parking in such a space is not in breach of local parking regulations.  These car park attendants do not have any official standing and the motorist searching for a free space should always bear this in mind.</P>

      <P>I wish the new Minister of State at the Department of Finance good luck in his new portfolio.  I hope he has good news for the people of County Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am raising this issue because, in the last couple of weeks, a number of articles have been written about County Leitrim and the problems we have compared to other countries.  In <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last week a headline proclaimed that the young are leaving lovely Leitrim in droves.  The 1991 census showed that County Leitrim has a population of 25,297 people, a decrease of 6.4 per cent since the last census.  Another startling <Col N="1608" /> fact emerged, in the 15-24 age group there are only 1,387 females in the county, fewer than one in eight of the total female population of the country. This is 50 per cent lower than the national average.  There are 1,687 males in the comparable age group, which is also close to 50 per cent lower than the national average.  It identifies the major problem of trying to keep our population in the county and to keep our identity.</P>
    <P>The Government can play a particular and positive role because County Leitrim has not been given any special incentives by the IDA or indeed the Government to attract industry to the area.  The Government could rectify this through their decentralisation policy and transfer a departmental office to Carrick-on-Shannon. At present, four counties have not benefited from decentralisation, Carlow, Roscommon, Monaghan and Leitrim.  I have no doubt that our problems are more urgent and immediate than the other three countries although I know that other people can make a fair case for them also.  We are not looking for 200 or 300 jobs; 100 departmental jobs would be a tremendous boost to the town of Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
    <P>As a town, Carrick-on-Shannon has many attributes.  It has excellent education and recreational facilities.  It is centrally located, at close proximity to Galway and Dublin.  Over the last number of years, however, Carrick-on-Shannon has suffered from the lack of a significant service or white collar project. In recent years the town has witnessed the closure of the local CIE freight depot, closure of the local Shell oil depot and, most significantly, closure of the local telephone exchange.  None of these projects has been replaced to date and consequently 120 jobs have been lost.  In a town the size of Carrick-on-Shannon the loss of so many jobs has had a significant impact on the commercial and social fabric of the town and the relocation of a Government office or service to Carrick-on-Shannon would go a long way towards <Col N="1609" /> compensating for these losses.  I appeal to the Minister to accede to my request.</P>

      <P>At the outset I sincerely thank Deputy Reynolds for his good wishes.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to place on the record of this House the success to date of the Government's decentralisation programme.  As Deputy Gerry Reynolds and the House will know, this Government are fully committed to the concept of decentralisation. For too long, the concentration of human and material resources in the centre, at the expense of the peripheral areas &mdash; I assure Deputy Reynolds that I know all about peripheral areas &mdash; had effectively deprived the provincial regions of their development capacity, while placing an enormous burden on the Dublin area. The resulting migration from the provinces over the years has been extensive and it has had substantial effects on the population, as outlined by Deputy Reynolds.</P>
      <P>This Government believe that the more widespread location of public service employment is a desirable long term objective to help reduce regional imbalances and the pressures on the Dublin region.  It was for this reason that the decentralisation programme initiated in 1980, and subsequently cancelled by a previous Administration, was reintroduced in 1987 when the Fianna Fáil Government took office.  I am glad to say that the speed at which the programme is being implemented since then has surpassed all expectations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will know that the original programme covers 12 locations countrywide. Phase I, which has been successfully completed, involved the relocation of approximately 800 public servants at four locations; Cavan, Galway, Sligo and Ballina.  Part of phase II of the decentralisation programme has also been completed, with the new offices at Killarney, Letterkenny and Athlone <Col N="1610" /> completed and now occupied by a total of 475 staff from the Departments of Justice, Social Welfare and Education respectively.  The remaining centres under Phase II consist of Ennis, Nenagh, Limerick, Dundalk and Waterford.  Construction has been completed in Ennis and staff will be transferred there in early 1992.  Work is in progress in both Limerick and Nenagh and will be completed in 1992 also.</P>
    <P>The Government's confidence and continuing commitment to the overall concept of decentralisation was highlighted again this year with the announcement on 12 June 1991 of a further major extension to the decentralisation programme to six new provincial centres; Cork, Longford, Wexford, Portlaoise, Tullamore and Kilkenny.  This extension to the programme will involve the transfer of approximately 1,400 staff to the locations mentioned.  Planning, acquisition of suitable sites, preparation of staffing and accommodation briefs in respect of the expanded programme are now being prepared, and significant progress will be made in 1992.  The Government are very encouraged that the beneficial effects of the decentralisation projects completed to date are already being fully felt in the centres selected.</P>
    <P>I sympathise fully with the Deputy's anxiety to see his county town, Carrick-on-Shannon, a beautiful county, benefiting from the programme, but I hope he will understand and appreciate that the selection of centres to benefit from the decentralisation programme is not an easy choice with so many locations to be considered.  It is unfortunate that many communities and towns which were considered have been disappointed to date.</P>
    <P>I need not stress that the decentralisation programme is an ambitious one.  Completing the present programme will take considerable time.  Deputy Reynolds will also realise that there is also the need to proceed with the programme on an orderly and phased basis. <Col N="1611" /> However, it is the Government's intention that the present programme will be completed as speedily as possible so as to ensure its success, which will secure the economic and social benefits to the various local communities throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pat Rabbitte has been given permission to raise the matter of the implications of the recent findings of the Labour Relations Commission for the re-entry of women to the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Reynolds, I want to take this opportunity to wish Deputy John O'Donoghue well in his new position as Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  The issue I wish to raise is an important one, the watershed decision by the Labour Relations Commission, conferring as it does, an entitlement on married women, who were forced to resign from the Civil Service as a result of the marriage bar prior to the 1977 legislation, to reapply for employment in the Civil Service.  I am somewhat disturbed that almost three weeks after that decision there has been no indication whatever from the Government of their attitude to such an important decision of practical equality for women.  As I understand it, under the new Act the Government have 42 days to decide whether or not to appeal.  It is important that the Government take a positive attitude as speedily as possible to what most people consider to be a watershed decision in respect of women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, there has been much uninformed comment about this decision and the Government have let it go unchallenged.  I would invite the Minister to say whether my understanding of the decision and its implications is wrong and whether he agrees with some of that uninformed comment.  For example, it has <Col N="1612" /> been suggested that the cost to the Government of this decision is £150 million. I have no idea where the figure came from.  I have never seen it attributed to anyone but yet it has featured in all the statements made in the public media about the implications of this decision.  I believe it is a figure plucked out of the sky and has no basis.  I hope the Minister will concur.</P>
    <P>The impression has been given that all married women forced to resign from the Civil Service by the marriage bar can now automatically claim a job in the Civil Service, but of course that is not the case. First, a great many women would not wish to return to the Civil Service and, second, the entitlement to return is subject to a vacancy arising.  Therefore, the impression that it does anything other than confer the same entitlement on married women as the single or widowed women have to reapply for their post without having to do the conventional examination is incorrect.</P>
    <P>The wilder suggestions of back money due, to the tune of even a fraction of £150 million, if this decision is blessed by the Government, have no foundation.  There was a retrospective element in the particular case because of the circumstances there, but generally speaking all it would do is confer on married women the entitlement to reapply for their jobs. There is no justification on financial or equality grounds for disallowing that entitlement.  It is a relic of a bygone era.  You cannot support discrimination between single and widowed women on the one hand and married women on the other.  I invite the Minister to tell the House what the Government attitude is to this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my gratitude to Deputy Rabbitte for his expression of good wishes, which I very much appreciate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, a civil servant who <Col N="1613" /> resigns can, in general, only re-enter the Civil Service by way of an open competition conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.  However, in view of the fact that, until 1973, women were obliged to resign on marriage, an exception to the general rule was provided by statute to allow for the reinstatement of widows without having to undergo a competition. In 1973, this provision was extended, again by statute, to include women who resigned on marriage or for reasons arising out of their marriage, but who subsequently, although they remained married, were not being supported by their husbands.  This could be due to desertion, separation or the inability of their husbands to support them through illness or for other reasons.  This amendment extended to certain married women the reinstatement facility which had previously been available only to widows.</P>
    <P>A great many changes have taken place since 1973.  There have been major developments in the Civil Service to promote equal opportunities.  The Civil Service has been particularly innovative in the area of combining work and family responsibilities through the introduction of schemes for career breaks, job sharing, flexitime and special leave for domestic reasons.  There are currently 2,500 people on career break and 1,200 people who are job-sharing, the great majority of whom are women.  Given these developments, it is not surprising that the number of women who resign for reasons related to marriage has declined dramatically over the last decade.  Also of considerable relevance in this context is the raising of the upper age limit for most competitions for recruitment to the Civil Service to 50 years.  This change enables women who gave up their posts for domestic reasons to return to the service by way of the regular open recruitment competitions.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, while the traditional reinstatement provisions were only intended to provide a sort of safety net where things went wrong for a woman who had resigned for family reasons, <Col N="1614" /> more recently the aim has been to create the conditions whereby women can remain in the workforce and I am satisfied that no employer has done more than the Civil Service to achieve this.  The dramatic reduction in such resignations and the high take-up on the career break and job-sharing schemes suggest that the policy is working.</P>
    <P>The facility for reinstatement has, however, continued in operation but the operation of these provisions was challenged in autumn 1990 by the Employment Equality Agency.  The matter was referred to an equality officer who has now made her recommendation.  The equality officer has concluded that the reinstatement provisions are discriminatory under the terms of the 1977 Employment Equality Act.</P>
    <P>In considering the implications of the decision, it is important to point out that no one has an automatic entitlement to reinstatement.  A woman who qualifies for reinstatement is not actually reinstated until there is a fillable vacancy in her own grade in her own Department and the appointment must be approved by the head of her Department and the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the importance of this issue.  The implications of the recommendations by the equality officer, both practical and the legal, are being considered by the Department of Finance in consultation with the Attorney General's Office.  In the circumstances, I am sure the Deputy will understand my reluctance at this stage to comment in detail on the recommendations or to speculate on possible responses.</P>
    <P>However, I should point out that this Government, as part of their policy to bring order to the public finances, have significantly reduced the numbers employed in the Civil Service in recent years.  This has inevitably resulted in a reduction in the number of job opportunities arising in the Civil Service each <Col N="1615" /> year.  Any development which would further reduce or, perhaps, eliminate completely the remaining employment opportunities for school leavers and graduates in the Civil Service would obviously be a matter of great concern. Of course, I need hardly say that there can be no question of reversing the policy on public service numbers.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Employment Equality Act, 1977, for an appeal to the Labour Court against an equality officer's recommendation.  On present information it seems that there are grounds for an appeal to the Labour Court. However, a final decision on this matter will not be made until the Department's examination of the recommendation is complete.</P>

      <P>In Castlerea, County Roscommon, secondary education is delivered on two campuses, in the old vocational school and in the Convent of Mercy secondary school.  The buildings in both schools are in an appalling condition. In all, 13 buildings are involved, three of which have been deemed unsafe for any type of activity and unfit for habitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A campaign for a new community school started back in the eighties and agreement was reached between the various parties in 1986 that a community college would be established in the town. The then Minister for Education agreed in principle to this, however no action was taken on it until I tabled a question in 1989 which activated the Minister for Education, who later met with a deputation from the town.  In February 1990 the Minister wrote to the principal of the <Col N="1616" /> convent school informing her that the community college would proceed in 1990.  However, in May 1990 the Minister again wrote to the principal saying that plans for the school accommodation were being revised and in June of the same year, after much protest, a compromise was reached.  It was then expected that the Department would proceed with the plans.  But there was almost another year and a half of inactivity, and the Department were hardly in communication with the school until late 1991.  The Department informed the principal that they were proceeding with the school and that the plans would be submitted for tender. It emerged that the contractor who was chosen to carry out the works was inadequate for some reason and the Department would then have to examine the second lowest tender.  I understand that is taking place.</P>
    <P>Classes cannot function in this school for another year in present conditions. The roof is leaking, all the classrooms are damp and three of them have been condemned as unfit for any use.  We want funds to commence building of the new school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Davern) Noel Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>A community school has been approved for Castlerea, County Roscommon to replace the existing vocational school and the Convent of Mercy.  Following a site feasibility study it was decided that the new school should be developed by means of the provision of a new building comprising approximately 2,000m2, and it is also proposed to carry out upgrading work to the existing building.  The school has been planned to cater for 500 pupils in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tenders were invited for this project in July 1991 and these tenders are currently being examined by my Department's design team and a preliminary tender report is expected to be submitted shortly to the Department for examination.  Progress on submission of the preliminary tender report has not proceeded as <Col N="1617" /> quickly as might have been desired as difficulties arose in determining the capacity of the lowest tenderer for the main contract to undertake the project. As he was unable to comply with all conditions of the contract the lowest tenderer subsequently withdrew from the project.</P>
    <P>My Department have recently conveyed approval to the design team to proceed with the examination of the next lowest tender and as I have previously stated it is expected that the preliminary tender report will be submitted shortly. My Department have also reached agreement with the Sisters of Mercy in Castlerea regarding the purchase of the site and the legal formalities are now in the process of being finalised.</P>
    <P>I can therefore confirm to the Deputy that I fully recognise and accept the pressing need for the earliest possible commencement of construction of the new community school in Castlerea as soon as circumstances allow.</P>

      <P>The conditions in Laghey national school must be the most primitive in County Donegal, if not in Ireland.  The present school accommodation consists of four classrooms, three which are of a permanent nature and one second-hand pre-fabricated hut that was purchased and erected in the school yard in 1969, 22 years ago.  Though the pre-fabricated classroom has been reconstructed many times since then and has had a new roof, side walls and doors, it is today in a hopeless state of disrepair.  It is impossible to keep it adequately heated during the winter and is musty and suffocating during the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three permanent classrooms are small, cramped and completely unsuitable for present day curriculum purposes and pupil centred teaching methods.  The classrooms are heated by open turf and <Col N="1618" /> coal burning fires which often result in a smokey, smutty and dull atmosphere, not at all conducive to teaching or learning. There are no other essential facilities, such as an assembly area, a teachers' room, a medical room or a library and the sanitary facilities are hopelessly out of date.</P>
    <P>The management, teachers and parents of Laghey national school have shown remarkable patience and tolerance at the manner in which they have been treated these last 20 years. However, at this stage it is understandable that their patience is under severe strain.  They have been led up the garden path so often during that time, only to be met with disappointment and frustration.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the extension went to tender last spring but since then little or no progress has been achieved.  I am urging the Minister today to have the Laghey national school extension immediately approved and have the contractor appointed so that work can commence on this much-needed and long-awaited extension.</P>
    <P>Much progress has been achieved in the provision and improvement of primary school facilities in Donegal these last ten years.  However, that progress will remain besmirched if we are left with the scandalous neglect of Laghey, its school and its pupils.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The building project for the school consists of an extension of two classrooms and the conversion of the existing three classrooms to two classrooms.  The present position is that tenders for the <Col N="1619" /> project have been received and have been examined.  The question of the placing of a contract will arise for consideration in the context of the 1992 capital allocation for primary school buildings.  As the Deputy knows, we are at present deciding on those issues.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> It has been the policy of my Department for many years that persons with mental handicap should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals unless they cannot receive psychiatric care in any other way.  Where patients have been admitted to a psychiatric hospital, health boards have been encouraged to care for the mentally handicapped in separate accommodation and to develop programmes of activity suited to their needs. In some cases health boards, with my Department's agreement, have separated the care of the mentally handicapped entirely from the rest of the hospital and transferred responsibility for their care to the community care programme, which is responsible for mental handicap services generally in the areas concerned.  I am aware from the reports of the Inspector of Psychiatric Hospitals that a high standard of care is being provided for people with mental handicap in some psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services, which was launched earlier this year, endorses this policy.  It recommends that an assessment be carried out of the circumstances and needs of each person with mental handicap in a psychiatric hospital to ensure that people are receiving appropriate care.  If the assessment indicates that it would be inappropriate to transfer the person, he or she will continue to be cared for in the psychiatric services in dedicated accommodation in as homely an environment as possible.  If the assessment indicates that the person with mental handicap no longer needs care in a psychiatric setting, the report recommends that he or she should transfer to the care of a mental handicap agency.</P>
    <P>My Department have appointed an adviser with expertise in the care of people with mentally handicap in psychiatric hospitals to work with the health boards and voluntary agencies to further the policy of improving the care of persons with mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>There were 1,495 people with mental handicap placed in psychiatric hospitals on 31 December 1990.  I will circulate <Col N="1523" /> a tabular statement showing this figure broken down by health board area.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <P>The multi-organ donor card system in place encourages people to donate their organs after their death.  The continued success of any transplant programme depends on the availability of organs. Waiting times for organ transplantation <Col N="1525" /> vary for recipients depending on the availability of donor organs and also on their suitability for individual patients. The matching of a donor organ to a potential recipient involves complex testing depending on the organ involved. Harvesting of organs is co-ordinated through the renal transplantation unit at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>Ireland is also associated with the United Kingdom Transplant Support Service which maintains a computerised waiting list of patients in the United Kingdom and Ireland requiring an organ transplant.</P>
      <P>With regard to kidney transplantation, there were 137 transplants performed in Beaumont Hospital in 1990, which compares favourably to the number of such transplants in other countries.  Eighty per cent of Irish patients requiring kidney transplantations are operated on within two years.  The waiting list for kidney transplantation in Ireland also compares favourably with other European countries.</P>
      <P>There is also a highly successful heart transplant programme at the National Cardiac Centre in the Mater Hospital.  A total of 56 heart transplant operations have taken place in the Mater Hospital since 1985.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the transplantation of lungs is in the early stages of development compared to other organ transplantation.  There is no lung transplantation programme in this country and patients who require lung transplants are referred abroad to suitable centres for treatment, as are patients who require heart/lung transplantation.  Seven patients were referred abroad for these procedures in 1990.  My Department are at present awaiting a formal proposal from a number of clinicians concerning the feasibility of establishing a heart/lung transplantation programme in this country.</P>

      <P>Circular No. 21/85 issued by my Department to the chief executive officer of each health board sets out in detail the procedures to be followed in relation to the referral of patients for treatment abroad.  Each health board was asked to bring the circular to the attention of all consultants in its area, including those working in voluntary hospitals.  The main provisions of the circular are as follows: 1. Health boards should ensure that when consultants are making inquiries abroad about the possibility of treatment for any patients, they do not make any definitive arrangements for such treatment without prior approval.</P>
      <P>2.  Before any patient is referred abroad for treatment a health board must ensure that the following procedures are adhered to: (a) The application to refer a patient abroad must be assessed before that patient goes abroad except in cases of extreme urgency; (b) Medical evidence must be provided by a hospital consultant giving details of the conditions from which the patient suffers and the type of treatment envisaged; (c) It must be certified by the consultant that: (i) the treatment concerned is not available in this country; (ii) there is an urgent medical necessity for the treatment; (iii) there is a reasonable medical prognosis; (iv) the treatment is regarded as a proven form of medical treatment; (v) the treatment abroad is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  Where a consultant is satisfied that a case meets the above criteria, the consultant should apply for sanction to the health board.  The health board issue <Col N="1527" /> sanction by way of Form E112 which, in accordance with the scheme, patients are required to present at the referral centre prior to admission.  Where costs of treatment are expected to be over £10,000, the health board must apply to my Department for approval to the issue of an E112.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any major difficulties in relation to the operation of the circular. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I would be glad to have it investigated.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>The success of new techniques and forms of treatment which has improved the quality of life for many patients has, however, led to increasing demands being placed on the health services with a consequent effect on waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, this can be described as a problem of success.  The Government have placed great emphasis on tackling waiting <Col N="1530" /> lists and have allocated additional funds to improve matters in specific problem areas such as cardiac surgery, hip replacement, cataract and ear, nose and throat surgery.</P>
    <P>On the general question of waiting lists, I would however draw the Deputy's attention to the conclusion of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group that the numbers recorded as being on waiting lists may significantly overstate the number of patients who are, in fact, awaiting treatment in the absence of regular validation to remove the names of patients who have been treated elsewhere, moved away or deceased.  The group stated that such validation is not common at present and recommended that it should be adopted as a firm policy in each hospital. Deputies will be aware that an advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor David Kennedy has been established to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group and I will be asking the advisory group to pay particular attention to waiting lists.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the recent call made by the Aidswise Organisation to employers and trade unions to think about the way to respond to sickness caused by HIV infection and AIDS in the workplace; if she has any plans to facilitate the involvement of employers and unions in the battle against AIDS; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have noted the recent statement made by Aidswise about persons with AIDS and HIV in the workplace and share the concern of that organisation that persons who have contracted the infection are not discriminated against and are supported appropriately in their place of work.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware a policy on AIDS has been in operation in the Civil Service since 1988.  This policy was agreed under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service and contains the following: 1.  Officers who are HIV positive or who suffer from AIDS will be retained in their jobs for as long as they can perform their duties to an acceptable standard. 2.  The normal sick leave regulations apply to staff who suffer from AIDS.  3.  All details of an officer's health record will be treated in the strictest confidence.  4.  Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or medical condition will not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar policy in respect of the health boards and local authorities is being <Col N="1532" /> finalised between the trade unions and the management of the health boards and local authorities and will be introduced shortly.</P>
    <P>In the private sector the Federated Institute of Employers introduced guidelines in 1988 regarding AIDS in the workplace which set out the facts regarding the transmission of the virus and advice to workers on how to avoid contracting the virus.  The guidelines also refer to the fact that a person who is infected with the virus should be able to continue working as normal while medically fit to do so.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that there has been progress achieved to date between the trades unions and employers in relation to AIDS in the workplace.</P>
    <P>I will be keeping the issue under review through the recently established National AIDS Strategy Committee, which I will be chairing, to ensure this progress is maintained.</P>

I recognise the need to maintain the progress begun in the past two years to increase the number of acute beds for the elderly in general hospitals and the availability of respite beds. In the past two years an additional £8 million has been made available to expand community and acute hospital services for the elderly as recommended in the Report of the Working Party on services for the elderly &mdash;<i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i> Health boards have used this funding among other things to expand the number of respite facilities for the elderly and to develop acute <Col N="1533" /> departments of medicine for the elderly in general hospitals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The entire area of medical liability gives rise to concern for a number of reasons.  The number of claims against doctors and hospitals is rising; the size of awards made to successful claimants is rising and the associated legal costs falling on the parties to claims are also rising. The result of these developments is a significant increase in the cost of providing insurance cover againt the risk of claims.</P>
      <P>My Department have had the area under examination for some time.  As Deputies will appreciate, the issues arising in this area are extremely complex touching as they do on fundamental rights under the Constitution.  Any change from the present system of dealing with claims will have to balance the rights of patients against the rights of doctors and will also have to have regard to the financial burden which might fall directly or indirectly on the Exchequer. For these reasons this examination may take some time, but I do not believe that consideration of these issues should be undertaken in a hasty manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen the draft policy statement on this and associated issues drawn up by the Irish College of General Practitioners. The statement is a very useful summary of the background to current <Col N="1538" /> concerns and the college must be congratulated on managing to condense such a complex series of issues into a concise document.  I would prefer to have an opportunity of discussing these issues with representatives of the college and other interested parties before making any comment on their recommendations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware from the reports of the Adoption Board and from other sources of the increasing number of tracing inquiries from adopted persons and birth parents of adopted persons.</P>
      <P>I share the concern that has been expressed by professionals working in the adoption services about the involvement of private investigators and other individuals in this extremely sensitive and delicate area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is general agreement among the various organisations involved in the adoption area as to the desirability of a formal arrangement to facilitate contact between adopted persons and their birth <Col N="1539" /> parents.  It has been suggested that a voluntary contact register might be an appropriate mechanism for facilitating such contact.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in principle with the concept of a voluntary contact register. Such an arrangement would indeed be of assistance to adopted persons and birth parents seeking to contact one another. It would also have the effect of helping to curtail the activities of non-professional private individuals in relation to post-adoption inquiries.</P>
    <P>However, the very nature of a contact register gives rise to a number of complex questions which require very careful consideration. Of fundamental importance would be the manner in which identifying information about a party to legal adoption proceedings would be recorded and the circumstances in which such information would be disclosed.  Great care would have to be taken in order to ensure that the right to privacy of adopted persons and birth parents is not undermined. It would be essential to devise adequate safeguards to preserve the anonymity of people who do not desire contact.  It would also be necessary to examine whether a contact register should have a statutory basis and who would be the most appropriate body to operate it.</P>
    <P>As regards the issuing of guidelines to agencies providing post-adoption services, this is primarily a matter for the Adoption Board who have overall responsibility for the administration of the adoption system, including the supervision of the work of the adoption societies. I shall bring the matter to the attention of the board.</P>

      <P>Hospital consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors are due to receive particular elements of special pay awards in 1992.</P>
      <P>Hospital consultants were awarded a special increase in pay following the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector (Report No. 32) and the negotiation of a revised common contract. Although this award was implemented with effect from 1 June 1991, the Government have obtained the agreement of the medical profession to defer payment of the retrospective elements of the award to 1992.</P>
      <P>Non-consultant hospital doctors were awarded a special pay increase under the terms of the previous agreement on pay in the public service.  This award was made on a phased basis under the terms of a Labour Court recommendation.  The first phase was paid on 1 May 1991 and the remaining phases are due to be made in March and September next year.</P>

      <P>In the period since the expiry of the term of office of the most recent National Health Council, a number of specialist reports have been commissioned by my Department in relation to specific aspects of the health services.  These reports include the report of the Commission on Health Funding and the reports of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commissioning of such reports reflects to a large extent the diversity and complexity of the range of health services being provided from public funds and the need to maximise efficiency and effectiveness within the limited available resources.  Specialist advisory groups <Col N="1542" /> have been set up to examine such issues rather than refer them to the more broadly based National Health Council.</P>
    <P>It was for this reason that my predecessor did not see the need to reappoint members to this council since 1988.  While I am satisfied the approach adopted by my predecessor was the correct one, the issue of appropriate advisory arrangements will be considered in the context of the implementation of the recently announced Government decisions on the re-structuring of the health services.</P>

      <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, national school-going children are entitled to free dental treatment in respect of defects noted at health board dental examinations.</P>
      <P>Most health boards have now adopted a school based system for the delivery of dental services to school children.  This approach aims to examine all children in specific classes and to provide treatment, if necessary.  The classes chosen are usually first or second class and sixth class.  These classes are chosen with preventive measures in mind and to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.  All eligible children can avail of an emergency service which is available on demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second level school pupils, as a group, do not qualify for free dental services under the Act.  However, at present eligibility is extended to children in this group in the following circumstances: if they require treatment in respect of dental defects detected at child health examinations while still at national school; if they are dependants of persons with full eligibility; and if they are dependants of <Col N="1543" /> persons who are judged by the chief executive of the health board to be unable to provide a specific service for themselves or their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    <P>Priority is given to the school based service by all of the health boards.  In a small number of areas, particularly in Roscommon and Mayo, the service had been restricted up to the recent past because of a shortage of manpower.  The position in these areas is now improving and new dentists have been appointed to serve both counties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the valuable contribution made by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and other rape crisis centres around the <Col N="1544" /> country in the counselling of victims or rape and sexual abuse.  Discussions have been taking place between representatives of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and officials of the Department and the Eastern Health Board to agree a secure basis for the funding of the centre's activities.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed that funding of £100,000 will be presented to the centre in 1992 through the Eastern Health Board to ensure that the centre will continue to provide its present level of service.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the centre have identified further needs which they wish to meet but which they are not in a position to finance from fund raising and the grant referred to above.  Discussions are continuing with representatives of the centre, the Eastern Health Board and my Department about how these needs can be met.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the funding of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre is now on a firm basis and that agreement will be reached on the remaining issues in the near future.  I will be keeping in touch with the centre on this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to rape crisis centres located outside of Dublin financial aid in support of the centres' activities is made on an annual basis by the appropriate health boards following consultation with the centres.  I understand that these arrangements will continue in future years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> Of the eight cases referred, two were successfully prosecuted and fines of £100 in each case were imposed.  The companies concerned are Phoenix Security, 115 Upper Dorset Street, Dublin 1 and Security Watch (Dublin) Limited, Kiltale, Dunsany, County Meath.  Four cases have either been adjourned or are still awaiting hearing, one case has been withdrawn as the employee has left his address and efforts to contact him have failed and one case was withdrawn when the employee was paid £810 due in arrears of wages.</P>
    <P>I do not consider it appropriate to divulge the names of the companies against which prosecutions are either pending or against judgments were not obtained.</P>
    <P>In relation to (3), (4) and (5) of the question as regards enforcement procedures other than prosecutions, I would refer the Deputy to the final paragraph of my reply on 19 November 1991.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Officers of this unit interviewed unemployment payment claimants in Portlaoise from 15 October 1991 to 17 October 1991 inclusive.  They attended at Portlaoise branch employment office on Tuesday 15 October 1991 and accepted unemployment dockets from some 400 persons, who prove unemployment there.  Each peson was spoken to for the purpose of verifying identity, and ensuring that she/he understood, and complied with, the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments.  As the number of persons dealt with was large, no one was spoken to for much longer, in general, than some minutes.  Of those spoken to, 71 were requested to attend over the following two days for further interviews regarding their claims.  These were cases in which more comprehensive questioning regarding compliance with the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments was required, or where reports of alleged fraudulent claiming had been <Col N="1554" /> received.  I have no information that my Department's normal standards of courtesy and consideration did not apply in these investigations.  If there is specific evidence to the contrary I will have it investigated.</P>

      <P>I understand that the person in question, who is in receipt of a widow's contributory pension, sought assistance from the Eastern Health Board after her flat was burgled and personal belongings stolen.  As her pension was payable on the same day, she received a once-off payment of £10 in respect of her previous weeks pension which had been stolen.</P>
      <P>It would now appear that she did not advise the board of the full extent of her losses in the burglary.

      <P>Where possible, national school health examinations are carried out on the following basis: a comprehensive medical examination of all new entrants to national schools; a selective medical examination of children in the nine to ten years age group; and examination of other children selected on the basis of information furnished about them by their parents, teachers, nurses and other interested parties.</P>
      <P>The scheme is structured in a manner that ensures as far as possible that every child is examined at least once and, on the basis of random checking at nine to ten years of age twice or more in some cases.</P>
      <P>In 1989, the latest figures available to my Department indicate that over 21 per cent of the national school population was examined.</P>

      <P>All bed and breakfast premises, including those not on Bord Fáilte's approved list, are subject to the usual legislative requirements regarding safety, food hygiene, taxation, public liability and so forth.  There are no plans to depart from current arrangements whereby Bord Fáilte, the body with responsibility for regulating standards in tourist accommodation, continue to actively promote and encourage operators to participate in their voluntary approval system which offers advantages such as inclusion in all marketing material and reservations systems operated by the bord.</P>

      <P>In December 1990, following a public tendering process, the Government approved the placing of a contract with the Doolin Ferry Company Limited for the provision of a cargo/passenger ferry <Col N="1571" /> service between Galway and the Aran Islands for a period of five years at an annual cost to the Exchequer of £475,000.  The annual Exchequer subsidy payable is in respect of the provision of a year round ferry service between Galway and the Aran Islands.</P>
      <P>On 1 April 1991 the contractor commenced the operation of the new ferry service between Galway and the Aran Islands using an upgraded cargo vessel. This interim service, which already marks a significant improvement on the quality and frequency of previous services, is being provided by the contractor pending the completion of a new vessel, custom built for the contractor to meet the requirements of the new cargo/passenger ferry service.</P>
      <P>I understand that the new vessel is likely to be available for the service by early September 1992.  There is no Exchequer contribution to the cost of this vessel.</P>
      <P>Details of the construction and layout of the new vessel, together with the financial and construction arrangements, the size, type and makers of engines on the vessel and the agents handling the sale of engines for the vessel are matters for the ferry operator.</P>
