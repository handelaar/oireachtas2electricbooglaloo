      <P>It is rather unusual to take a point of order at the commencement of Questions, Deputy Bruton.  Can it not wait?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, in view of the fact that Question Time and the proceedings of the House started five minutes late, will the Government &mdash; and you &mdash; arrange for Question Time to be extended by the five minutes which have been lost as a result of the late arrival of the Government?  In view of the fact that this is the second time in a week that the House has started late, could we have an assurance that it will not recur?</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I raised a question whether (a) additional <Col N="1546" /> time will be provided for the time lost as a result of the late arrival of the Government and (b) we will have an assurance that this will not become a pattern.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection, a Cheann Comhairle.  I recall when the Deputy's party were in Government that we had frequent delays of much more than five minutes, in fact we had delays of days.  On one occasion the Leader of Fine Gael tried to get the Ceann Comhairle not to recall the Dáil at all.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, it has not yet been possible for the round-table talks to get under way on an agreed basis.  The Government share the very widespread sense of disappointment at the further delays being encountered.  However, it is our belief that, with further intensive and constructive efforts all round, the present difficulties can and indeed must be overcome. For our part, we will continue to <Col N="1558" /> make every possible effort to facilitate agreement.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister indicate the Government's position on the difficulties which have arisen with regard to the location of the second phase and the question of an independent chairperson? Would he also indicate that the three-phase structure, which I understood had been agreed, remains as announced by Mr. Brooke in the House of Commons some weeks ago, or if this structure has been amended in any way? Would he inform the House the steps which he thinks the Government can take to facilitate the commencement of the round table talks?</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to underline the vital importance of these talks and the need for all participants to ensure that their negotiating approach is commensurate with the gravity of the problems which the talks are seeking to address.  Indeed, the further deaths in Northern Ireland during the past week must surely reinforce the determination of all involved to get down to the crucial task of seeking an agreed way forward through the political process.</P>

My earlier question was whether the three-phase structure originally agreed remains intact and if the apparent amendment, arising from the meetings between the Unionist leaders and the British Prime Minister, has the agreement of the Government and if the apparent difference of opinion between the response of the Department of the Taoiseach last Friday and that of the Department of Foreign Affairs is of significance in the current situation.</P>

It has been very clear from the outset that there are three interwoven strands none of which can be dealt with in isolation.

      <Qid>6</Qid>
      <asker>Mr. M. Higgins</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the initiatives he favours in terms of international action to deal with a Government level response to the structural bases of famine disaster and food shortage problems in Africa and elsewhere; and if the Government have taken any action to secure an international conference on such issues.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying causes of famine and food shortages in developing countries are often extremely complex. In addition to natural disasters and crop failures due to lack of rain or plant disease, they can be due to such factors as general under-development and the related problems of low investment and <Col N="1561" /> productivity, indebtedness, unsustainably high population growth, desertification and other environmental problems, over-dependence on cash crops to the neglect of food security, and low commodity prices.  The countries most affected are generally those classified as least developed.</P>
      <P>A significant factor in turning severe food shortages into famines in some countries in Africa at present is the existence of bitter civil conflicts which absorb large amounts of money and effort of the countries concerned, devastate land, create large numbers of refugees and hamper relief efforts.</P>
      <P>The Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, in which Ireland participated, took place last September.  It reviewed the experience of these countries over the last decade and set out a programme of action for the nineties.  This programme stresses that there must be effective macro-economic policies in each country which will accelerate growth and development and take account of the needs of the most vulnerable groups in society.  The key to success will be the grasping of control of the development management process by the least developed countries themselves.  They must develop their capacities to devise and implement policies, manage aid effectively and enable more citizens to participate in the process.  Donors should pay increased attention to these countries, and give particular emphasis to institution building and investing in human development, including support for education, health and the role of women.  Particular emphasis should be placed on rural development strategies, and strengthening the environment for private sector development.  Special attention will need to be paid also to debt and trade policies which will contribute to the integration of the least developed countries into the international trading system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sets a framework for international action and I am pleased to note that the Irish bilateral aid programme, which concentrates on institution building and the <Col N="1562" /> development of the capacity of very poor countries to take over and manage their own programmes, fits very well into this structure.</P>
    <P>There are other very important initiatives which I regard as particularly valuble, including the special programme for highly indebted low income countries in sub-Saharan Africa operated by the World Bank.  The European Community has contributed 500 million ECU to this programme, which is aimed at assisting these countries to restructure their economies, cushion the adverse social impact of economic adjustment and tackle environmental problems.</P>
    <P>Ireland and its partners in the Community have discussed in detail the structural problems to which the Deputy refers, with the 69 countries of the ACP group.  These discussions culminated in the recently agreed Lomé IV Convention, a comprehensive agreement designed to resolve the long term and structural problems of African and other economies.  The main emphasis of the convention is on rural development and food security.  At the same time it attempts through trade concessions and stabilisation of export earnings to assist in building self-sufficiency in the ACP economies.  The long term structural problems are also addressed through a specific Community programme of support for structural adjustment, in close co-ordination with the World Bank and the IMF, which is contributing to the strengthening of several of these economies.</P>
    <P>Some African countries, such as Ethiopia, have long term structural food deficits and need to import a large amount of food every year.  In such cases, the provision of food aid in food-for-work schemes on a carefully organised basis can be an important measure in meeting these deficits and in helping developing countries to build necessary infrastructure, in particular to tackle erosion and flood problems which restrict food production.  In addition, counterpart funds which are created when food aid is <Col N="1563" /> sold on the markets of developing countries are used to create long term agricultural projects as well as to alleviate hardship caused by economic reforms. Discussions within the Community are continuing on how to get the best results from these instruments.</P>
    <P>In relation to the civil conflicts which are exacerbating the current food crisis in some countries, we are active in promoting and encouraging discussion in EC fora and elsewhere to put pressure on all parties to give absolute priority to humanitarian needs, in particular access for food supplies.  We also continue to give strong support to efforts to stop the fighting and to bring lasting peace to the unfortunate populations of the countries concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced that the calling of an international conference would be the best approach at this time. I have already referred to the work of the least developed conference last September. The 18th Special Session of the General Assembly which I attended last year, was devoted to international economic co-operation, in particular to the revitalisation of economic growth and development of the developing countries. The eighth session of the UN Conference on Trade and Development will take place next February, and the UN Conference on the Environment and Development in June 1992.  We would hope that these conferences will be occasions for constructive dialogue <Col N="1564" /> between developed and developing countries on how best to address the fundamental structural problems to which the Deputy refers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am very grateful for the Minister's rather lengthy reply and to him reminding me of what I had read of these previous reports and meetings, my question focuses very specially on two immediate events: the 29 million to 30 million Africans who are dying and the number of deaths that have taken place in Bangladesh in the absence of what was possible by way of providing aid in terms of diet and flood prevention techniques.  I would like to ask the following specific supplementary question. Does the Minister not agree that the logistical failure to come to the aid of 29 million to 30 million Africans, is an urgent problem going over and beyond the matters he listed in his reply?  Faced with the reality of 29 million to 30 million Africans starving, does he not agree that a new and urgent initiative is necessary? In view of what his answer states, that the African region has been a net exporter of capital over and above all the aid it has received in the past five years, would he agree that this is an indictment of all the efforts he has described, and does he not feel moved to take a further initiative? My question asks what international initiatives he favours.  Is the Minister now telling the House that he proposes to wait until the conference in February 1992 by which time 29 million to 30 million people, who could have been assisted, will have died?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be reminded that considerable aid is being given to the 29 million to 30 million African people, who I agree are on the verge of starvation at present.  Massive efforts are being undertaken to try to bring help to them as quickly as possible.  I agree that what we are doing is not enough and that more will have to be done.  I have given the House the reasons in detail everybody's efforts have failed up to now <Col N="1565" /> to ensure that we do not have to face this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's reply may I ask if it is the attitude of the Irish Government to support an international call for debt cancellation?  I would ask the Minister to respond to what I have suggested.  The African Continent, in which 30 million people are dying &mdash; and some will die today &mdash; is exporting capital and the measures the Minister described in terms of Africans being told to become more self-sufficient and to put in place macro-economic policies through the IMF, is the recipe for debt.  Do the Irish Government favour a different approach towards international indebtedness of the African region?  Yes or no?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have been prompt and generous in their response to the emergency situations in Africa and Bangladesh.</P>
      <P>We are very concerned about the deteriorating situation in Africa where up to 30 million people are threatened by starvation in several countries in the sub-Saharan region including, in particular, Ethiopia and Sudan.  Since the beginning of 1990 the Government have provided over £1.5 million from the disaster relief fund to assist emergency famine relief efforts.  This includes an amount of £325,000 which is our bilateral share of the latest European Community initiative to provide up to 600,000 extra tons of food aid to Africa.  This is being allocated to Concern and Trócaire to provide food for parts of Ethiopia where food supplies have almost run out and malnutrition levels are rising sharply.  In addition, our contribution to the EC budget will rise by nearly £1 million this year to meet our share of the Community-financed part of this initiative.  A further contribution of £250,000 has been provided from the Agriculture Vote to the World Food Programme for food aid for Sudan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Bangladesh, the full scale of the devastation caused by the cyclone of 30 April is not yet known.  Official estimates stand at approximately 200,000 dead and an equal number of people injured.  Millions of people have lost their homes and all their possessions and are <Col N="1567" /> in need of food, clean water and shelter. Many thousands are suffering from diarrhoeal diseases brought about by polluted water and malnutrition.  There has been widespread devastation of crops, livestock and infrastructure in the affected areas.</P>
    <P>The response from Ireland to this tragedy has been substantial.  The Government's initial response was to allocate £200,000 on 2 May and it has since raised this to £275,000.  Irish non-governmental organisations are involved in providing relief programmes valued at over £2 million.</P>
    <P>I participated in discussions on the provision of a special European Community relief programme at the Foreign Affairs Council on 13 May.  I am pleased to note that agreement has been reached on the provision by member states of 60 MECU bilaterally for relief operations.  Ireland's share of this is the £275,000, to which I have already referred.  The European Commission has already allocated 10 MECU and has also devised an action plan under which it will provide an extra 20 MECU for food aid and reconstruction.</P>
    <P>In so far as international efforts to provide for adequate flood control in Bangladesh are concerned, the Community is one of 15 major donors which are supporting the implementation of the comprehensive flood action plan prepared by the World Bank and covering the period up to 1995.  This plan involves initial expenditure of 130 MECUs on a large number of pilot projects and studies.  The Community has so far contributed 14.5 MECU towards these.  It is hoped that these studies will give rise to further investment projects totalling 400 MECU.</P>
    <P>Other assistance provided by the Community in this sector for Bangladesh includes over 25 MECU to assist with rehabilitation work following the 1987-88 floods and 4 MECU in 1987 for cyclone protection and flood control measures.  In the climatic and geographical conditions which prevail in Bangladesh, where disasters such as this are likely to recur, the emphasis must be on preventive action <Col N="1568" /> on an appropriate scale.  The Irish Government strongly support European Community participation in these programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief as I would like to get a response to my other question also.  In view of the scale of the horror in Bangladesh and also in Ethiopia, Sudan, Mozambique, Angola and Liberia, does the Minister not agree that the response at official level from the Irish Government is absolutely miserable, that he is trying to confuse the issue by bringing in the EC contributions, and that there is now a strong case for a supplementary Estimate to be introduced in this House which would enable us to discharge our international obligations in common humanity?</P>

We cannot solve the problems alone but need to work with other countries, particularly our Community partners. Ireland's contribution to the latest Community initiative is £1.3 million.  Surely that is a clear indication of the seriousness of our commitment to the famine victims in Africa.</P>

      <P>Following the outbreak of the Gulf criss in August 1990 and the subsequent UN sanctions imposed on Iraq, the European Community and its member states agreed in October 1990 to provide economic assistance totalling some 1500 million ECU to the three frontline states which were very seriously affected as a result of the imposition of UN sanctions.  These were Egypt, Jordan and Turkey.  Five hundred million ECU was provided from the Community budget and the remaining 1,000 million ECU by bilateral donations from the member states.  Ireland's bilateral contribution was £3.5 million.</P>
      <P>The decision to give £3 million of this total to one of these frontline states, namely Egypt, was based on the fact that of the three it was poorest in <i>per capita</i> GNP terms.  This follows the practice of our bilateral aid programme in seeking to direct aid to poorer countries.</P>
      <P>While this aid from Community member states was primarily intended for three states, Ireland decided to allocate £250,000 of its contribution to Sudan in the form of food aid to take account of the fact that the economic effect of the Gulf crisis would adversely affect its ability to cope with a severe famine.</P>
      <P>I would also mention that in addition to this allocation Ireland has provided £320,000 in emergency relief to Sudan since the outbreak of the Gulf crisis. Ireland has also maintained since 1975 a bilateral aid programme to Sudan which is one of the &ldquo;priority&rdquo; countries in our ODA programme.  The allocation for Sudan under this programme in 1991 is £600,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, on 17 April, made a full report to the House on the meeting of the European Council in Luxembourg which took place on 8 April.  The plight of Kurdish refugees was the main topic of the meeting.  The famine in Africa was not discussed on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council on 15 April discussed African food aid needs. In my reply to questions in the House on 17 April I gave a general account of the situation regarding food needs and supplies. The situation is most serious in the Horn of Africa &mdash; Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia &mdash; where about 15 million people are at risk.  Many other countries, in particular Angola, Mozambique and Liberia are facing a worsening situation.  According to the estimates from the Commission at the time it proposed the latest initiative by the European Community and its members states, there was an overall cereal requirement of 4.5 tonnes in food aid.  Pledges from donors then amounted to about 3 million tonnes, of which the Community was supplying 1 million.  This left a shortfall of 1.5 million tonnes.</P>
      <P>The latest initiative by the Community will mobilise an additional quality of up to 600,000 tonnes.  A priority will be to ensure that it is delivered with all possible speed.  This will have a significant impact on the current needs.  It is expected to occupy fully the capacity of internal transportation and of the international and non-governmental organisations to handle supplies over the next few months.  It will not be enough, of course, to cover all requirements to the end of the year.  However, it is to be hoped that other donors may also announce an additional effort.</P>
      <P>Ireland is playing its full part in the Community initiative by making a contribution of £325,000 in addition to approximately £1 million which we will pay through the Community budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to contributions through <Col N="1573" /> the Community budget, Ireland's allocations through the disaster relief fund for bilateral relief in Africa in 1991 stand at over £700,000.  A further contribution of £250,000 is being provided to the World Food Programme in Sudan.  We also contribute to the efforts of other international relief agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the information the Minister gives in relation to the amount of aid, surely the question is whether the European Community is responding in time to what are well forecast crises of hunger in Africa.  I have a report which indicates that the crisis facing Sudan and so forth was forecast last autumn and yet we are dealing with this as an emergency.  It seems extraordinary that we do not appear capable of dealing with these crises of hunger unless we see the problem facing us on the television screens.  Would the Minister indicate what kind of early response mechanism exists at European Community level to monitor what has been forecast with regard to hunger in Africa and to take the steps needed to prevent the worst effects of this hunger?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission has available to it information with regard to the developing situations in the countries we are talking about, and on the analysis of such information the Commission puts forward proposals on how we might deal with the problem and we will be as helpful as we can.  I have listed in detail for the Deputy the actions of the Community and our own bilateral actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair comment for the Deputy to say that perhaps the Commission, the Community and ourselves, did not act in time but we have acted, and acted quite readily, when the proposals come to us. It would be fair criticism as well to say that the delivery of the aid has not been adequate because there are many other problems there which have to be overcome. The Deputy will know that some months ago we debated in this House the question of the tragic civil war in Ethiopia and the difficulties we had in getting food aid to different parts of that country when the port of Massawa was sealed off by the Government of the day who would not allow us to use its facilities.  Despite the best efforts of the Community, the Commission and ourselves at times, for reasons I have already given in a long answer to Deputy Higgins and which was <Col N="1575" /> not acceptable to our colleagues here in Fine Gael because of the information in it, it is not always possible to do what one wants to do at the appropriate time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that, despite the list he has given us here today, it is clear that it is not answering severe problems in Africa. Would the Minister now undertake, as was done in 1984, to form part of the ministerial visit to Africa to endeavour to raise the profile and the responsibility of the European countries in this issue? Would he further tell me if he has any information of the effect the departure of President Mengistu from Ethiopia will have on the EC's relations with Ethiopia and if he will perhaps take up that issue as well?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Some elements of the Deputy's supplementary question have already been dealt with this afternoon.  I do not propose to go back over them again.  With regard to the section of her question which deals with the possibility of a ministerial visit to Africa, I presume for the purpose of getting information, I can assure the Deputy that there is no shortage whatsoever of information within the European Community and here with regard to the situation as it is there.  There are many problems which have to be overcome, first in getting the aid to these people.  The Deputy recognises that and I have already mentioned it.  I see no purpose in sending a ministerial delegation there as of now.  If I thought it would achieve anything I would be strongly in support of it.  At Foreign Ministers meetings which are held twice a month we regularly have discussions on the situation as it is developing with presentations and analyses of the problems from the Community and from the Commission which are most helpful to us in formulating policy after informed discussion.</P>

Would the Minister see merit in the suggestion of my colleague, Deputy Owen, that we would suggest to the European Community that a ministerial delegation would go to Africa for the purpose of developing a political initiative which would lead to a greater response on the part of the Community to the awful crisis emerging there?</P>

      <P>Ireland is strongly supportive of the efforts of the UN Secretary General to facilitate a solution to the Cyprus question.  I am glad to be able to inform the House that the UN Secretary General, in his latest report to the Security Council on 27 March 1991, concluded that the two sides to the dispute have <Col N="1578" /> been forthcoming and he was generally optimistic that current conditions are favourable for a solution.  I welcome that report from the Secretary-General, while recognising that his special representative's mission is by no means completed.</P>

Are the European Council or any of the European institutions using their influence with Greece and Turkey, who are applying to join the European Community, and with Cyprus who are also seeking access to the European Community to encourage a resolution of the outstanding problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that efforts have been under way for a considerable time to get talks going in an effort to deal with this issue.  In February 1990 talks resumed, following pressure from the UN and the EC and a demarche by Turkey.  The talks were to be on the basis of the existing framework and proposals. They broke down when Mr. Denktash formally made new proposals for recognition of the Turkish-Cypriot people and their right to self-determination a precondition for further discussion. He also presented, as a concession to the Turkish-Cypriot position, a statement made by the Secretary General in his remarks opening the talks to the effect that there was no majority and no minority in Cyprus but only two peoples with equal political rights.  Following the deadlock UN Security Council Resolution 649/90 of 12 March 1990 called upon the leaders of the two communities to pursue their efforts to reach a freely mutually acceptable solution and requested the Secretary General to pursue his mission of good offices.  The latest report of the Secretary General <Col N="1579" /> outlines his objective as an overall agreement between the two communities.  He and his officials have been working with both communities in an effort to bring them sufficiently close on each aspect of the proposed outline solution to make it possible for both sides to work out an agreement between them.  Progress to this stage has been made on some issues, in the opinion of the Secretary General, but it has still not been possible to reconcile the two communities on other imporant aspects.  Nevertheless, the Secretary General considers current conditions to be favourable in his attempt to arrive at an agreed outline to have discussed between the two leaders.  He hopes to report again in early July on progress made by him in this regard.</P>

The best course open to us, and our EC partners, is to support his efforts. It is clearly understood by everybody that this is a very complex issue and that the Secretary General is using his good office in an effort to get agreement between the two sides.  The discussions between the two sides, and his office, are continuing and we hope to have a further report from him in July on progress made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>On 15 April the Luxembourg Presidency submitted a composite text to the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union.  The draft text lists possible amendments to the Treaty of Rome on the main issues being considered by the conference.  These issues fall into three specific categories.</P>
      <P>First, there are amendments to the Treaty of Rome in the areas of environment, research and development, social policy, health, education, culture, trans-European networks and consumer protection.</P>
      <P>Second, there are the proposals regarding a common foreign and security policy, and finally, there is the issue of intergovernmental co-operation in justice and home affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The text draws on the wide range of views and proposals put forward by member states and by the Commission in the course of the first stage of the discussions.  In order to facilitate discussion during the second stage, the Presidency has attempted to produce a text which, in its opinion, reflects majority views.  The Presidency text is a working document and the Presidency has made it clear that it is not to be seen as a compromise proposal.  The Government consider it to be a useful contribution to the conference &mdash; a document which will focus discussions and help to move them toward an eventual consensus.  It is, however, very much a working document and is subject to constant amendment and revision to take account of the views expressed by member states and the Commission.  Further amendments to the text will be both <Col N="1581" /> inevitable and necessary before we reach a final agreement.</P>
    <P>We are still at an early stage in the second round of negotiations.  At ministerial level, our discussions have concentrated almost exclusively on common foreign and security policy and on the future role of the European Parliament in the legislative process of the Community. It was not until last week that we had our first very general discussion on a number of other items including economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the Government are participating and will continue to participate actively in the detailed examination of the draft Treaty with the aim of ensuring that our concerns and interests are reflected in the new Treaty.  In submitting texts of draft articles to the Conference we must judge whether such contributions would be helpful to our interests and likely to gain general support from other member states.  Our endeavours are now channelled into seeking to strengthen the articles to which we attach importance.</P>
    <P>Finally, we are pleased that the text already reflects the language of proposals which we tabled at an earlier stage of the Conference on health, education and economic and social cohesion.  Copies of these have been laid in the Library of the House.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister tell the House whether the proposals in the Presidency text largely meet the Government's objectives in these negotiations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily so.  It is a working document and there are quite a number of areas where the text of this Presidency working paper tries to draw together positions of the different countries in an effort to see if we can find a common ground between us.  We had our first discussions only last week on a number of issues in relation to political union.  It is no more than a working document and it would be wrong to call it a draft text for Treaty purposes.</P>

      <P>The Presidency working document is no more than a working document and it is important to remember that.  We are a long way from a draft text for Treaty amendment purposes. The discussions are ongoing.  There will be much movement.  For instance, as I said to the Deputy and other Members of the House on 17 April last in reply to parliamentary questions, there is a wide divergence of view between member states on security-military-defence elements being discussed at present.  We are way out, far apart for one another in a number of areas and fairly close together on others.  It will be a long time before we get to where we will have a draft Treaty to put forward for discussion.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach was replying today to an earlier question of mine I referred to a speech made by Mr. Jacques Delors in New York on 24 April in which he clearly indicated that he regarded defence as part of security.  He indicated also that the EC should build on what it already had, which he named as the Western European Union.  Will the Minister outline his attitude to the proposal that the Western European Union form the basis of a defence alliance within the EC?  Does he see that proposal having any relevance in the current negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is an MEP and will be only too well aware that on occasion Jacques Delors puts forward his personal point of view on matters affecting the Community and the way he would like to see the Community developing in the future.  That is his right.  It is an attitude we all respect and support even though we may not at all times agree with the point of view he puts forward.  The <Col N="1583" /> question of common foreign and security policy is being discussed within the Twelve.  No decisions have been arrived at.  We are working within the guidelines laid down for us by the heads of State or Government at their meeting in Rome before Christmas.  That is the framework within which we are working.  It is open to Jacques Delors or anybody else, as the French have done in promoting the Western European Union role and the future security of Europe, or indeed the British and the Dutch in promoting a role for NATO within the European Community. Many suggestions are being made at present and all are being discussed but we are still a long way from arriving at a final decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the two conferences operate in parallel for a fundamental reason, that if we move towards a single currency under the control of a single central bank that implies the co-ordination of fiscal deficits in member states at European level, that it would be intolerable that that be carried out by the central bank without democratic control, that that necessarily implies an executive responsible to Parliament, appointed by Parliament, and capable of being dismissed by Parliament, to take decisions of such fundamental importance to our respective democracies?  In the light of that, can he say whether our Government have pressed this issue and, if not, why is it not featuring as the principal element in the conference on political union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy FitzGerald that it is the wish of the heads of State or Government that both InterGovernmental Conferences would operate in parallel for the reasons he has given.  Nevertheless, I want to say to Deputy FitzGerald we are still at a very early stage with regard to the discussions under each of the headings.  EMU or political union.  Many suggestions have been made and many of the suggestions have been abandoned.  We are in the <Col N="1584" /> process of discussion, negotiation and we are still a long way from results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I raise a specific issue?  With the view to ensuring that it is a major element on the agenda and that we press to have adequate democratic control of the whole fiscal area, which is implicit in the decision about the central bank and the currency, will we make that an element of our policy and put it forward strongly and has the Minister done so?</P>

      <P>Last February I suggested to the Minister that he produce a White Paper outlining the Government's objectives in relation to these two conferences so that we would have some benchmark on which to judge the conferences and also because the results will have to be put to the people in a referendum and at the time the Minister indicated he would seriously consider my proposal.  I now wish to raise the issue with the Minister and ask whether he will now positively commit himself to the production of such a White Paper?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless I missed the response of the Minister, he did not indicate the Government's attitude to the Luxembourg proposal with regard to Western European Union and also what his attitude was to the point made by Jacques Delors.  I do not want to get into a dispute about whether Jacques Delors was speaking as President of the Commission because that is a debate which will lead nowhere.  The Minister is on record &mdash; in the newpapers at least &mdash; as indicating that he is not happy that the European Parliament should have increased powers.  Can the Minister clarify his attitude to that?  There is a proposal in the Luxembourg document that the Parliament would have greater powers.  I understand the Minister's response is that they would not like to see the current powers of the Council reduced in any way because they feel they have a greater clout at that level than they would have in the Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy De Rossa, I will not go back over the part of his supplementary question which I dealt with earlier.  In relation to the European Parliament, we already know the very strong views held by the Parliament about what it feels its role should be and what it wishes to see from the IGC on political union.  Some member states are able to support almost everything the Parliament is looking for, while others are much more reserved.  For our part we will look carefully at the demands of Parliament, see what improvements can be made to existing procedures and reflect together what additional powers might be granted to Parliament and in which areas.  We will <Col N="1586" /> also wish to take into account the need to preserve the balance and efficiency in the operation of the Community institutions as we seek to ensure the democratic legitimacy of the Community and its democratic accountability.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific issue of codecision, I have already outlined to the House on previous occasions that we have some reservations about the procedures proposed by some member states in the Parliament.  We believe the role of the Commission in the legislative process must be maintained, including its sole right to make proposals and its capacity to amend proposals at any stage in the process.  As I have already stated, we accept there has to be a genuine increase in the capacity of the Parliament to make a substantial contribution to the legislative process; for example, this could include giving greater attention in the Council to the first opinion of the Parliament. We could also envisage the establishment of an effective and more extensive conciliation procedure in which all three Community institutions could meet to resolve outstanding difficulties and draft legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The visit to which the Deputy refers was on the occasion of the annual ministerial conference between the European Community and its member states; the countries of Central America, Panama; and Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela as countries active in co-operation in Central America.  This was the seventh in the series of San José <Col N="1587" /> conferences: the sixth took place in Dublin in April 1990.</P>
      <P>The EC Ministers reaffirmed their support for peace, democracy, human rights and economic development in Central America and for the Esquipulas process, which has brought about substantial progress towards peace in the region.  They expressed support for the role of the UN in reducing tensions in the region and helping to bring about national reconciliation in some of the countries concerned. As a specifically European contribution to promoting respect for human rights, they undertook to set up a multi-annual human rights programme directed primarily at security force, law enforcement and administrative personnel. The Commission and the Ministers also agreed to make an urgent study of possible adverse effects on Central America of the decision to grant tariff concessions to certain Andean countries to help them in their struggle against drugs by encouraging crop substitution, and agreed to take compensatory measures if it were established that Central American exports had, in fact, been harmed.</P>
      <P>The peace process launched at the Esquipulas II Summit is now well established and has enabled the countries of the region to realise substantial progress in reducing tensions between them, reducing armed forces and armaments and putting in place democratically elected governments.  They have been able to turn their attention to economic development and regional economic co-operation. The first Central American summit devoted to economic issues was held at Antigua, Guatemala, in June 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations have been going on for some time between the Government of El Salvador and the FMLN guerillas under the auspices of the UN Secretary General and his personal representative, Mr. de Soto.  The Ministers welcomed the role being played by the Secretary General.  Subsequently, the Twelve on 10 May issued a statement welcoming the outcome of the latest round of talks in <Col N="1588" /> Mexico City and calling on both sides to continue to show flexibility.  I see this negotiation as offering the best prospect for a genuine and lasting peace in El Salvador.</P>

They will need help.  We are prepared, as is the Community, to help them.  There is room for cautious optimism.</P>

Where is the Esquipulas agreement now, in relation to the European Community suggested assistance for freeing trade between the Central American countries which could be embargoed by any one of those countries if the situation is changed in that regard?  Did the conference the Minister spoke of and reported on consider the circumstances that now arise in view of the fact that only $53 million out of $256 million promised by the US have been delivered after the Nicaraguan election?</P>

      <P>Article Five of the Anglo-Irish Agreement states that the Conference will consider &ldquo;the advantages and disadvantages of a Bill of Rights in some form in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  In February 1987, proposals on a Bill of Rights were presented by the Government to the British Authorities.</P>
      <P>The Review of the Working of the Anglo-Irish Conference, completed in 1989, states that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Both Governments reaffirm the fundamental importance of the proper protection of human rights and will continue to discuss through the mechanism of the Conference all legislative and other means by which human rights may be better protected in Northern Ireland&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The Government continue to favour the introduction of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate what response, if any, there has been from the British Government or whether the British Government produced alternative proposals with regard to a Bill of Rights given that it is one of the areas about which virtually all of the democratic parties agree?  Will the Minister indicate what specific progress has been made with regard to considering the advantages and disadvantages of a specific Bill of Rights as distinct from simply looking at the need to improve the <Col N="1592" /> protection of human rights under existing legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Governments reaffirm the fundamental importance of the proper protection of human rights and both Governments agree that they will continue to discuss, through the mechanisms of the conference, all legislative and other means by which human rights may be better protected in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard that the first time.  Does this mean that there is agreement between both Governments that a Bill of Rights is something which will be introduced and if so can the Minister indicate on what basis such a Bill would be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter had been discussed on a number of occasions and undoubtedly it could well feature on the agenda for round talks if some can be got underway between the political parties in Northern Ireland, ourselves and the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is totally unsatisfactory that five and a half years after the signing of the agreement no progress has been made in this matter and will he accept that the argument put forward that there are problems about a Bill of Rights in one part of the United Kingdom, that at the same time, they will not have it in the whole of the UK, is unacceptable, and will he agree to press this matter forward for a satisfactory conclusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are convinced of the need to provide greater protection of human rights in Northern Ireland and remain convinced that a Bill of Rights would provide adequate protection to members of both communities and would reassure them that their basic rights would be protected from legislative or executive abuse.  The Government will continue to pursue that goal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 18, 29, 35, 37, 39, 41, 56, 57, 58 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat disappointed by the pace of developments in the Cambodian peace process in the early months of this year.  However, the impetus of the negotiations has been restored and there are hopeful signs that the current momentum will be maintained leading to a just and lasting settlement of this tragic conflict.</P>
      <P>An important meeting took place in Paris on 21 and 22 December, 1990.  At that meeting the two co-chairmen of the Paris International Peace Conference on Cambodia, France and Indonesia, presented to members of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia the draft agreements on a comprehensive political settlement, as agreed by the five permanent members of the Security Council, on 26 November, 1990.</P>
      <P>While there was a convergence of views on most of the fundamental points of the draft agreements, some reservations were expressed by the Phnom Penh regime in relation to the role of UNTAC, United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, and its possible effects on the regime's authority and structures.</P>
      <P>A bilateral meeting in Hanoi on 1 and 2 February between Vietnam and the co-chairmen of the Paris Conference failed to resolve this outstanding difficulty, which remains an obstacle to reconvening the Paris conference.  Moreover, the problem of agreeing on the chairmanship of the Supreme National Council, which I outlined in my statement of 6 December 1990, also remains unresolved.  A meeting of the Supreme National Council will take place in Jakarta at the beginning of June and I sincerely hope that with sufficient flexibility all the outstanding difficulties can be finally settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of reports that the Khmer Rouge have used tanks in their military operations and that the regime in Phnom Penh has also used tanks and heavy artillery. The deployment of such heavy weaponry can only intensify the suffering <Col N="1596" /> of Cambodians and further delay a peaceful settlement.  I am, therefore, happy to note that the latest reports from Cambodia indicate that in response to the appeals of the international community, including that made by the UN Secretary-General, the ceasefire, which the parties to the conflict have accepted, appears to be holding, however precariously.</P>
    <P>As I indicated clearly in my statement to the Dáil of 31 October 1990, I deplore any arms trafficking, from whatever source, to the Khmer Rouge.  Our concern on that point is well known to all interested governments.</P>
    <P>The Government will support all constructive efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Cambodian conflict. Deputies will recall the important part played by Australia in proposing an enhanced role for the UN in a settlement of the Cambodian conflict.  I share the view of the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, that the current negotiating effort must be complemented by an immediate ceasefire.  I welcome the current ceasefire and I appeal to all parties to ensure that hostilities are ended permanently.</P>
    <P>During my official visit to Japan last week I had discussions with the Japanese Foreign Minister, Mr. Nakayama, on the question of Cambodia and on the Japanese proposals.  I indicated to the Japanese Foreign Minister that Ireland welcomed all efforts designed to bring about a just and peaceful settlement of the Cambodian conflict.  Japan and Ireland share the belief that the UN plan for Cambodia represents the best avenue towards achieving a just and lasting settlement of the conflict.  We also believe that there must be adequate provision in the settlement to ensure that there is no possibility of a repeat of the genocidal policies of the past.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report that a UN &ldquo;good offices&rdquo; mission is now in Cambodia. Ireland fully supports the mission and has already contributed £100,000 to the UN Trust Fund to finance the start up costs of the UN operation in Cambodia.</P>
    <P>I am particularly conscious and appreciative of the depth of awareness <Col N="1597" /> and sympathy that exists in Ireland for the plight of the Cambodian people. Since the beginning of November 1989 my private office and my Department have received approximately 2,200 communications, by letter or by telephone, expressing a desire for a just and lasting settlement of the conflict that exclude a return to power of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge.  This reflects a commendable concern by the Irish people for the victims of this tragic conflict.</P>
    <P>I will continue to do my utmost to promote the cause of peace and reconciliation in Cambodia and to ensure that the objective of a comprehensive peace remains firmly on the agenda of the international community.</P>
    <P>The international community are making every effort to create the conditions in which the parties to the Cambodian conflict can resolve their outstanding difficulties.  It is now up to these parties to demonstrate a corresponding commitment at the forthcoming Jakarta meeting and to facilitate an early reconvening of the Paris conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his extensive reply and I pay tribute to the 2,200 people who took the time and interest to make representations to his office.  In the Minister's discussions with the Japanese Government did he give a commitment and support to the Japanese proposals that the UN draft agreement be extended to give the UN the responsibility to verify the different stages of the ceasefire rather than just accept the word of the Khmer Rouge that they have laid down their arms? Did he accept the setting up of a special committee to investigate the human rights record of the Khmer Rouge during their rule?  Did he make a commitment to accept that any faction that resumes fighting after the demobilisation of troops be banned from the electoral process?  Those are the three points made for the UN agreement by the Japanese Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we support the efforts of the Japanese in regard to this <Col N="1598" /> issue.  The House would agree that the Japanese are playing a very important role, a role that we all welcome.  In connection with Ireland's support for the Japanese proposals for a committee to investigate the human rights record of the Khmer Rouge, Deputies will know that I share their deep abhorrence at the crimes carried out by the Pol Pot regime against the Cambodian people.  I have great sympathy with the view that those involved should be investigated and, if possible, be brought before an appropriate tribunal to answer for their crimes. I can support any proposal that will investigate the past and ensure that such practices never recur.  However, the urgent necessity for the long suffering Cambodian people is to bring a permanent end to the fighting and a just and lasting peace to that country.  I believe that the UN peace plan is the best hope to achieve that objective.</P>

I wrote to you, Sir, last week after the discussion we had in relation to the Standing Orders for the Order of Business last week and I forwarded a legal opinion which I had obtained in relation to the conduct of business in this House.  I am grateful for your reply, which I received today, in relation to that matter.  It appears that you are not prepared to dissuade the Government from this practice which you inform me is part of procedure in this House, despite the fact that it is not within Standing Order 143.  I do not believe &mdash; I say this to the Taoiseach &mdash; that this is the proper way to do business, as was the case last week in relation to the Local Government Bill and this week in relation to the Finance Bill.  I also hear that next week we will have a guillotine motion on the Health Bill; this is not the <Col N="1684" /> way to do business.  We are opposing the Order of Business today and we will continue to oppose it as the Government's parliamentary programme for this term falls into tatters.</P>

      <P>I specifically oppose the motion being taken without debate which is a bad precedent, and I dealt with this matter on a previous occasion.  I do not have any objections to dealing with subsection (2) of the motion which deals with the Adoption Bill; in relation to the Finance Bill, it is a bit much to introduce the budget in late January, to introduce the Finance Bill almost three months later and to expect it to be dealt with, including more than 160 amendments, in a matter of three days. The time of the House could be used more effectively if the Government would agree to have a committee established to deal specifically with the Finance Bill a short time after the budget is introduced in this House.  It would certainly be a more rational way of dealing with a major portion of the business of this House.  On that basis, a Cheann Comhairle, I oppose the proposal under No. 7, with the exclusion of the matters relating to the Adoption Bill.</P>

      <P>Gabh mo leithscéal, Deputy Bruton.  In respect of what has been said in the matter of the Order of Business, it arose following an exchange of views between Deputy Bruton and myself where it was suggested that the matter should be cleared up once and for all and where, subsequently, the House was advised as to what is proper on the Order of Business.  I do not want to bore the House again by reading out what they are, and Deputy Spring knows it well.  As in character, I suppose we are all forever trying to get around or evade the rules.  The rule is there and it is no pleasure for me or any occupant of the Chair to appear to be resisting.  That is the arrangement which is agreed, and I must carry it out.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;If the Consumer Price Index for the month of December preceding the year of assessment for income tax is higher than it was for the previous December then, unless the Dáil otherwise determines, all income tax allowances, income tax bands and income tax exemption limits pertaining on the enactment of this Act, will be increased <Col N="1704" /> by the same percentage increase as the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index, and, if the result is not a multiple of £200, rounding it up to the nearest amount which is a multiple.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to increase bands, allowances and exemption limits in the income tax code every year by the amount which the consumer price index has increased over a 12-month period. In other words, this amendment would make it mandatory on the Minister for Finance &mdash; indeed this would follow automatically &mdash; to index-link all allowances, bands and exemption limits.  This is a very necessary amendment as our income tax code is particularly complex and when the Minister announces changes on budget day there are always winners and losers. The very complexity of the code quite frequently makes it impossible for people to know the net effect on their income tax affairs.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice of Ministers for Finance in all Governments in recent years to seek to magnify the good news in their budget and to conceal the bad news.  That process of presentation makes life difficult for the ordinary taxpayer. This year, for example, in the table which followed the Minister's very lengthy speech, the net effect of the income tax measures was that the generality of income tax payers were £53 million better off just on the changes announced by the Minister on budget day.  Of course, they were not necessarily £53 million better off because there is another figure in the total figures which the Minister has included for buoyancy of revenue and a lot of that buoyancy would come from income taxpayers as well.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister for Finance late in 1990 asking him what it would cost to index bands and allowances, and he told me that each 1 per cent of indexation would cost £15.5 million, which is fair enough.  I did not ask him what it would cost to index the PAYE allowance and the personal allowance but I am sure the Minister's officials have that figure there.  It is probably £3.5 or £4 <Col N="1705" /> million so the cost of each 1 per cent indexation would be £17 or £18 million. At an inflation rate of 3 per cent this turns out at about £52 million.  The net effect of the Minister's measures on budget day on his own figures was £53 million.  It was presented as a major tax reform budget with massive gains for people paying income tax and in particular on the PAYE sector but in fact the Minister either indexed the take or probably left the generality of income taxpayers slightly short.  As long as we have a situation where the kind of fiscal drag of rising prices ensures that a greater and greater proportion of people's real income is taxed at the higher rates then there will be great unhappiness and scepticism about any claims that the tax system is being reformed.</P>
    <P>I put down another question to the Minister last year also on the percentage of taxpayers paying tax at the standard rate.  In 1990, 63 per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the standard rate only and that means 37 per cent paid tax at 48 per cent or 53 per cent.  I remember having a debate with the Minister prior to the 1987 election where the only commitment made by Fianna Fáil on that occasion was that at the end of their period in office at least two-thirds of income tax payers would pay tax at the standard rate.  That minor enough promise has not been fulfilled and the Minister's intention and that of his colleagues in Fianna Fáil was diluted by the massive tax proposals of the Progressive Democrats when they entered into Government with them.</P>
    <P>Now we have the combined tax reforming resources of Fianna Fáil and their erstwhile colleagues now back in the fold, the Progressive Democrats, and the net effect of what they have done, after one allows for buoyancy, is to introduce a series of measures the total effect of which on budget day made the generality of taxpayers £53 million better off which, on my calculation, is slightly less than the rate of inflation.  Mind you, £53 million is a lot of money if one is talking about private income, or even corporate income.  However, when one looks at <Col N="1706" /> the total tax take as presented by the Minister, it is very small beer indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister estimates that all taxes will raise in excess of £8.3 billion in 1991, so £53 million out of that is very small indeed.  However, I am not going into the merits or demerits of what the Minister did on budget day.  What I want to point out is that as long as a situation is maintained where a Minister may pretend to give concessions while not indexing bands and allowances, then that Minister is engaged in a delusion, because when the real value of taxes and allowances is not maintained, people end up paying more tax on the real value of the same incomes.</P>
    <P>I believe that taxation measures should be transparent.  As far as possible on budget day the Minister should take the mystery out of it, take the illusion out of it, take the conjuring tricks out of it, and let people see what is actually happening. Fundamental to this process is automatic indexation of all bands and allowances. That does not tie the Minister because my amendment also says that if the Minister, for some reason, in some particular set of circumstances decides he is not in a position to index, he can come before the House on the Finance Bill and, in that particular year, say he is not indexing and propose the alternative quite clearly. Then that proposal will be a departure from the norm and it will be clear to everybody what is involved.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister increased personal allowances by something less than 2½ per cent.  I suppose at the time the rate of inflation was something less than 3 per cent.  The Minister extended the range of the standard band by around the rate of inflation.  The Minister did not do anything with the range of the 48 per cent band and he left the PRSI allowance and the PAYE allowance untouched.  By not increasing allowances as they should be increased to maintain their value, the Minister generated some extra revenue which he was able to dispose of and he disposed of it by reducing the standard rate by one point and by doing some other things also.</P>
    <P>I remember in Cabinet sometimes people thought they had done a good job <Col N="1707" /> when they brought their tax proposals forward on the budget.  One would notice quite frequently that budgets, on budget day or the week after, are greeted with approval by PAYE people.  That happens frequently because the presentation is good.  One will nearly always find that by the time the Finance Bill comes and one is into the first and second week of May when the first monthly salary and pay cheques of the next tax year are coming in, the sounds from the factory floor are quite frequently sounds of derision. People look at the bottom line and see that despite the fact that they were told in the budget that there would be big reductions, they end up paying the same or more.  Much of this sense of disenchantment, of frustration, of having been conned, which is common now amoung taxpayers, arise from the fact that the intention of a Minister for Finance on budget day with regard to income tax measures is frequently disguised and the Minister tends to disguise what he is doing in presentation of the budget.</P>
    <P>To clarify the matter this simple amendment will require a Minister to index these allowances, bands and exemption limits.  However, circumstances will arise when the fiscal position is so tight that the Minister in his wisdom will decide he cannot afford to do this.  This amendment will also allow him not to index in particular years but his decision will be transparent.  It will have to be put on the table.  It will have to be shown clearly that this is a departure from the automatic norm of indexation.</P>
    <P>The amendment deals with the technicalities of that procedures.  I am proposing the bands, allowances and exemption limits be increased by the increase in the CPI between 1 December and the following December.  Rather than have allowances and bands being denominated in odd amounts of money, I am also proposing a rounding up effect to the nearest £200, but if the Minister accepts my amendments and says to the nearest £100 allows him greater flexibility, that does not bother me.  I do not think it appropriate that one should have <Col N="1708" /> odd numbers for purposes of calculations varying from year to year; we should end up dealing with hundreds of pounds.</P>
    <P>This is novel here but it is the norm in the UK.  This has been part of the income tax code in the UK for years.  The late John Kelly, a former Deputy if he was here would be on his feet saying we do not have to imitate everything they do in the UK and asking why our policy is based on initiatives taken in the UK. However, we can always learn from our neighbours and, in the movement towards harmonisation in Europe on indirect taxes we are increasingly looking at the tax codes both direct and indirect in other member states.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the income tax code in the UK is this system of indexation. It certainly will reduce the flexibility of a Minister for Finance in the future, but it will make very clear on budget day what is happening.  Taxpayers will know if the full value of their allowances, and the range of the bands, is not maintained in real terms.  Adverse budgetary decisions in respect of income tax which upset taxpayers so much will be more difficult in future for a Minister for Finance to present as benefits when they are running counter to the interests of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I notice Deputies Rabbitte and Quinn in pages of amendments increased the amounts of allowances.  Deputy Rabbitte is using a 3 per cent indexer, if I may use the term, right across the range of allowances.  He is approaching the same problem in a different way but achieves exactly the same result for 1991.  I am not seeking to change the Minister's arithmetic for 1991.  I am trying to establish that it would be part of our tax code from December 1991 for the next tax year, and subsequent years, to have an automatic indexation method based on the CPI at December.  I know from what Deputies in the other main parties have put down that they agree with my approach and I ask them to support my amendment.</P>
    <P>It is worth saying at the start of a debate on a Finance Bill that all of us in politics are general practitioners.  We do not <Col N="1709" /> claim great accountancy expertise, apart from my colleague Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Certainly I do not claim drafting expertise. As Ministers do frequently, the Minister may criticise the manner in which an amendment is drafted but the intent of the amendment is absolutely clear and I ask the Minister to accept it.  It will be a bigger contribution to tax reform than any of the ideas being put forward by the Minister's lesser partners in Government because it will be real and substantial and something the ordinary overburdened PAYE person can readily understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of Deputy Noonan's amendment which, essentially, seeks to index bands, allowances and exemption limits by whatever is the CPI for that year.  I was just glancing at the Second Stage speech of the Minister who <i>inter alia</i> claimed that this year's measure &ldquo;will exempt some 18,000 taxpayers with 23,000 children from tax altogether&rdquo;.  That belongs to the Tommy Cooper school of fiscal reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>With the effect of fiscal drag a couple of percentage points under the PESP, no longer are that many people taken out of the income tax net and that, of course, is a fundamental point of reform.  The Progressive Democrats can cry all the way between various hiccoughs and crises in the Government about reducing the standard rate to 25 per cent, but the fundamental issue for so many tens of thousands of our people is how quickly they become liable for tax.  It is observed that so many people become liable for tax at a rate of pay theoretically of less than £70 a week.  Therefore, it is not tenable for the Minister to project that X thousand in any given year will be taken out of the tax net as a result of the changes he has made.  As soon as the first phase of the pay agreement is <Col N="1710" /> implemented or as soon as the effects of the new tax year bite on the pay cheque that is no longer the situation, and so on up the ladder.  The real level of tax liability is not being compared like with like. Having adopted the policy over recent years of going for tax reduction rather than tax reform, at least if we are to be consistent, we must and ought to have regard to the CPI.  The minimum reliefs, such as they are, ought to be at least maintained in real terms.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go over the arguments Deputy Noonan advanced.  The policy of indexation is good.  Deputy Noonan identifies the fact that in the various amendments under this section I have taken our amendments of last year and roughly increased them by 3 per cent right across the board for the various allowances and so on.  The idea was essentially the same.  That is why I support the thrust of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this excellent amendment in the name of Deputy Noonan.  A person who would have found himself in the higher income tax bracket, even at the lower end of the income scale because the PRSI ceiling for health contributions was raised, finds that instead of having the rate of contribution cut from 53 per cent to 52 per cent, he &mdash; or she &mdash; is now contributing at the rate of 54 per cent.  This indexation will make the sleight of hand which took place in the budget transparent.  It is all very well to inform this House on budget day that tax rates are being reduced by 1 per cent but tax from the same pay packet on the same day was increased by raising the upper limit on the health contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to do what Deputy Noonan is suggesting by indexing the bands and the allowances, any such &mdash; I will not use the term &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;&mdash; sleight of hand would be immediately transparent and could be laughed out of this House for what it is.  It borders on the absurd to tell somebody who has a contribution to the Collector General of PRSI and PAYE coming out of his pay cheque or wage packet each week that the Minister has given them a reduction in the upper band <Col N="1711" /> of tax rates by 1 per cent while at the same time he is taking more from them in PRSI.  It is hard to convince them there has been a real advance in reducing the tax take.  In fact, the whole tax take, particularly from those in the higher bands who are supposed to have done so well, is the same whether you call it PRSI or PAYE.  It is absurd to reduce the tax bands and at the same time increase the level of income which is liable to PRSI contributions and call that reform or advance.  It comes out of the same pay cheque, it goes into the same Exchequer and is used by the Minister to fund State services.  There is no difference; it is simply a book entry and it is codding nobody.  Deputy Noonan is right when he says that people on budget day think they are doing quite well but on 6 April when they receive their new tax free allowance certificate, or a month or two weeks later when they receive their pay packet, they find they are not significantly better off and sometimes they are worse off.</P>
    <P>If we are to inform the country at budget time that advances are being made in tax reform, that tax bands are being widened and that tax rates are being reduced, let that information be factual and let it stand on its own.  The information given on budget day does not meet these criteria.  It is clear that when you add the PRSI and PAYE rates together, the total tax take has increased for a very significant number of tax contributors. I ask the House to accept this amendment in the name of Deputy Noonan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the House be misled inadvertently, while I accept that what Deputy Noonan is trying to do in this amendment is to give a similar effect to the specific amendments in my name and in the names of other Deputies, I rise to query whether we should be supporting a policy of indexation.  If we have learned anything from the late seventies and early eighties it is that we have to get off the inflationary escalator of indexation and I will put down a very severe reservation. <Col N="1712" /> I know the amendment is specifically confined to income tax allowances and related income tax provisions, but indexation is not a policy I would like to see this House starting to support.  We have to learn from the immediate experience of the past.  Getting inflation under control has been a very painful process.</P>
      <P>In his reply the Minister will have an opportunity to indicate what is his thinking in relation to the policy of indexation. We can achieve similar objectives in a more pointed manner by specific allowances rather than a catch all amendment. If we are to be consistent, it would have to go the whole way, that is, if inflation falls to a certain point allowances would be reduced by that amount.  This is a no lose type of amendment where, if inflation were to fall, allowances would remain the same and there would be a net windfall beneficiary and this only comes into effect when inflation rises.</P>
      <P>When the Administration of which Deputy Noonan and I were members took office inflation was at 22 per cent. None of us wants to go back to that situation again nor do we want to send signals to anybody that there is a climate of opinion &mdash; certainly not in the Labour Party &mdash; that we welcome that kind of attitude.  Lessons have been painfully learned by people on fixed incomes.  We can do the sort of things Deputy Noonan seeks to do in a number of different ways but, as Deputy Rabbitte said, this is a policy of indexation in principle which he supports.  I would like to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the purpose of this amendment is clear; we will not talk about the drafting, as Deputy Noonan suggested, we will just leave that aside and deal with the spirit and intent of the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide for statutory increases in income tax allowances, tax bands and exemption limits, by reference to annual increases in the consumer price index, unless the Dáil should determine otherwise.  The amendment would, therefore, establish <Col N="1713" /> a principle of automatic entitlement to indexed increases unless the Dáil made other arrangements &mdash; either for a lesser or greater increase.</P>
    <P>The implication in the amendment may be that it would result in taxpayers being better off than they are under the measures introduced in the current budget. The opposite is, however, the case.  If instead of the budget scheme, the basic income tax structure consisting of the main personal allowances, exemption limits and rate bands had been indexed for 1991-91, in line with an increase of 2.7 per cent in the consumer price index, i.e. the increase in the 12 months to November 1990 &mdash; the index is not published to end-December &mdash; the cost to the Exchequer would have been £30 million in 1991 and £50 million in a full year. Similarly, indexing the PAYE and PRSI allowances would bring the total cost of indexation up to £35 million in 1991 and £58 million in a full year, which is lower by some £44.5 million in 1991 and £74.4 million in a full year than the cost of the budget concessions of £79.5 million in 1991 and £132.4 million in a full year. Clearly, the taxpayers' were much better off as a result of the budget than by indexation.</P>
    <P>The cost of the budget concessions on tax rates, exemption limits, personal and PAYE allowances over the last four budgets was in the region of £500 million greater than would have been the case if the relief given in those budgets had been confined to indexation of the tax rates, exemption limits, personal, PAYE and PRSI allowances on the lines suggested by the amendment.  Furthermore, under indexation there would now be an additional 30,000 low income individuals paying tax than is the case under the current system, and some 48 per cent of taxpayers would now be liable to tax at the higher rates compared with the current figure of 39 per cent.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Rabbitte, in talking about the recent budget as against indexation, I might give a few examples of how the budget compares with indexation.  For a single person taxed under PAYE and on <Col N="1714" /> the higher rate of PRSI of £6,500 in 1991, who got a pay rise in line with inflation, the budget scheme is better than indexation as the following figures will show. Without any budget change the figure would be 15.9 per cent of the income, with full indexation it would be 15.3 per cent and with the budget scheme it would be 15.20 per cent.  Perhaps I will now take an example at the other end of the scale. If a taxpayer had an income of £15,000 in 1991 and got a pay rise in line with inflation the result would be, without any budget change, 31.56 per cent, with full indexation 30.92 per cent and with the budget scheme 30.5 per cent.  There are many examples one can give throughout the system which clearly shows that taxpayers were better off under the budget than they would be under indexation. For example, a single person on PAYE and on the high rate of PRSI, on an income of £7,000 in, say, 1985-86, was paying 29.57 per cent and in 1991-92 will be paying 25.80 per cent of income.  This shows the graph and the direction in which it is going.  A person on £10,000 in 1985-86 would have paid 37.28 per cent of the total, including PRSI, in 1991-92 he would be paying 32.51 per cent.  Again, a person in receipt of £15,000 in 1985-86, total tax plus PRSI as a percentage would be 47.04 per cent as against 41.36 per cent in 1991-92.  I do not think there is any need to give any more examples.</P>
    <P>In addition, automatic indexation would greatly reduce budgetary flexibility and deprive the Minister for Finance of the day of an important discretion regarding budget decisions in any particular year and conflict with intended measures on other fronts.  For example, the House will be aware that the Government have made a firm commitment to reduce the standard rate to 25 per cent and move to a single rate of tax over the next two years, if budgetary circumstances permit. It might also give unrealistic expectations to taxpayers at times of difficult budgetary circumstances.  The amendment is probably based on the fact that a number of OECD countries have in the past introduced indexation provisions and that the United Kingdom has a similar provision <Col N="1715" /> to that proposed.  However, some of the countries involved subsequently discontinued the provision and the United Kingdom has not always adhered strictly to theirs.  As Deputy Noonan rightly says, if Deputy Kelly were alive, he would tell us to do our own business and not to look across the water.  In 1981 for instance, Parliament decided otherwise and no increases were given.  This illustrates the problems inherent in making decisions in advance of the relevant budget on questions of indexation.</P>
    <P>I have given Deputies some idea of the net cost, but in case there is any misunderstanding as to the comparison with figures in the explanatory table in the budget, I would point out that the cost in 1991 of the budget concessions is given in that table as £53.1 million in income tax.  The House may be under the impression that this figure can be compared with the cost of indexation, but that is not correct.  The cost figure of £53.1 million takes account not only of the income tax reliefs consisting of reduced tax rates, increased personal allowances, and an expanded standard rate band but it also takes account of Exchequer savings from the budgetary measures reducing life assurance relief and restrictions in the BES.  That figure does not include the cost of the increase granted in the exemption limits &mdash; a further £8.6 million in 1991 and £14.3 million in a full year.  The cost of the specific budgetary concessions in the area of tax rates, personal allowances, excluding the renewal of the PRSI allowance, wage bands and exemption limits is estimated at £79.5 million in 1991 or £132.4 million in a full year.  Indexation would normally be confined to these basic aspects of the tax system, and it is against these costs that the cost of indexation is to be compared. For those reasons I will oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That was an interesting reply but most of it did not deal with the amendment.  The Minister replied as if I was proposing an alternative to a series of Ministerial decisions <Col N="1716" /> on budget day.  The Minister based his argument on the fact that we would not have income tax announcements on budget day because if this goes into our tax code we would have automatic indexation. I do not propose that at all.  I proposed that this would happen automatically and that the Minister would from year to year judge income tax on its merits against the fiscal background and he would make his decisions in the light of events in a particular year.  There is no question of putting this forward as an alternative and for the Minister to reply to my amendment as if I had proposed an alternative is to misunderstand or to attempt to mislead the House as to my intentions.  I am surprised.  I thought I would have had a better answer to a serious amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply is an attempt to misconstrue what I said and to mislead the House and the public about my intentions. I would like the Minister to reply again and to defend his decision on its merits.  Allowances and bands and exemption limits lose their value as prices go up.  A £100 allowance will be worth less next year if prices go up by 3 per cent.  If we are to be honest with the tax paying public we should make it easy for them to understand the system under which they are taxed.  They should maintain the value of their allowances and bands unless the Minister can bring forward some reason to show why they should not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in the first part of his reply to my amendment acts as if this would be mandatory on the Minister.  The amendment is framed to suggest that this would be the norm but it is all conditional on &ldquo;unless the Dáil otherwise determines&rdquo;. The Dáil can otherwise determine on budget night or on the Finance Bill and the Minister would then have to stand up and explain why he was not indexing and why he had not the scope to index.  He would have to show what additional measures he was taking so that we would not have this sort of fiscal fudge which is called tax reform at the moment, where everything is swirled around in a budget and presented to the public as <Col N="1717" /> some great new recipe, and is not sustained over the succeeding months.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mitchell pointed out, when the first pay cheque came in after 6 April, the start of the tax year, there was a fundamental lack of confidence in the politicians' commitment to reform of the income tax code or to reduce income tax. The general public are convinced that what happens on budget night is an exercise in seeking to deliberately delude the public to make them think they are actually getting more benefits than they are getting.  When there is non-indexation what are not real benefits can be presented as benefits.  The Minister did not index on this occasion.  He did not touch the PRSI allowance, the PAYE allowance or the 48 per cent band.  The personal allowance is slightly under the rate of inflation.  Let us be clear about what I am proposing.  The Minister did not take on my proposition when he replied.  He pretended he thought I was proposing something else.  When the Minister called out the figures it seemed that he included indirect taxation figures when giving the total benefits.  It seemed also that the VAT figures were rolled in as well when the Minister came up with a figure of £76 million net as the benefit to income taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said in his reply that Ministers would be deprived of flexibility on budget day.  They would not.  My amendment says &ldquo;unless the Dáil otherwise determines&rdquo;.  The Minister would be deprived of flexibility to con the taxpaying public.  He would not be deprived of the flexibility to make any decision he liked, to put it to the Dáil and have it carried by a majority vote, which is the way we do business here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn talked about difficulties which might arise from automatic indexation and referred to the time when we went into Government when inflation was at 22 per cent following a Fianna Fáil Administration.  Inflation was high but the argument which Deputy Quinn produced applies more to the indexation of wages than to the indexation of tax relief.  One could argue that if one indexes tax allowances and bands the tax paying public <Col N="1718" /> end up paying less and that that would be a counter-inflation measure rather than an inflationary measure.  I argue that the non-indexation of bands and allowances is inflationary because real income goes down and spending power goes down, putting extra pressure on wage demands.  I agree with Deputy Quinn if one applies indexation to wage rounds; someone must break the spiral and it has to be broken.  There must be increases less than the rate of inflation so that the consumer price index will follow wages down, rather than following wages up.  I argue strongly that the contrary is true and we talk about indexation of allowances and bands.  Any such measure would be anti-inflationary.  The amendment stands on its merits.  What is proposed is the practice in other OECD countries and it has the benefits to which I have already alluded.  I shall ask at the appropriate time that the amendment be put.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

      <P>Deputy Noonan made a very good argument for indexation in relation to income tax.  Indeed, the reason The Workers' Party are supporting his amendment is that if the Minister made no change in the budget in this respect the PAYE worker would lose out.  Deputy Noonan made that very clear.  It is open to the Minister to make any alterations he wishes in the tax code while this indexation goes ahead automatically.</P>
      <P>After making such a cogent argument as to how the taxpayer would lose out if there were no such indexation, it was very interesting that Deputy Noonan went on to say that such indexation should not exist in relation to wages because it is inflationary, in other words, that the wage earner was not losing out at all by the lack of indexation but that the taxpayer was losing out.  There is no argument there.</P>

    <P>Deputy Quinn raised the issue of inflation, but I do not think he was correct in his remarks.  The principle of cost of living increases in relation to wage levels and indexation would be at least 50 years old.  It has also been accepted in the social <Col N="1719" /> welfare code, though, unfortunately, Ministers seem to be confining increases to cost of living increases rather than to fundamental increases in Social Welfare payments.  The tax code is the one area in which no allowance is made for inflation, where no indexation exists. Unless the Minister were to disagree fundamentally the increase would be automatic and the Minister's alterations, allowances, or bands would be additional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to respond in a general way to points made by Deputy Mitchell and others which appeared to give the impression that indexation was better than what had been implemented in previous budgets which is, of course, not the case.  I went on to quote figures not only from the previous budget and other budgets but also on the percentages taken out of pay packets, which is what is important.  Over a period it has been shown clearly that the tax policy pursued by the Government is indeed beneficial to the taxpayer rather than leaving him or her worse off, as seemed to be suggested by Opposition Members.</P>
      <P>I am also well aware that workers may not be paying PRSI in the final couple of months of the tax year and that consequently the impact of that at the beginning of the new tax year could give the impression that they were worse off. Government Members would all like to do more.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Quinn wanted to hear what the real feeling is about indexation as a policy instrument.  First, it ties the Government's hand.  The suggestion to index tax allowances and exemption limits by reference to the CPI assumes straight away that the present position is the correct position, that otherwise matters could be made worse for some people and better for others.</P>

      <P>The Member cannot have both sides of the argument.  He must <Col N="1720" /> say either that indexation is better than what has been done in the last budget or that it is not.  What is the Deputy saying? If he is saying that indexation is better, and so on, then he is making a different argument.  The argument then goes back to the amount of money that is available to be spent at a particular time and the best use to be made of it.  There should not be automatic right to indexing right across the board.</P>
      <P>If the Government were to have taken that principle in bad times or in the tough couple of years that have gone by, we would not have been able to have done what we have for the low paid with the exemption limits.  How many times above the inflation rate were some of those adjustments, adjustments that we needed, and further adjustment is needed?  To suggest, as did Deputy Mitchell, that it was a better proposition for the taxpayer to go down that road is to make the easy assumption that there is plenty more to add.  I have to live in the real world.  In a time of high inflation there may be a better argument for the proposition but there is no argument for it now.  I have given some of my reasons for that belief.</P>
      <P>We have all been lectured so many times about what is wrong in the income tax system, about the international consensus on tax, and that Ireland should try to bring down the rates and try to be as competitive as other countries.  The Government know of the rates that exist in the United Kingdom, which, to a large degree, is a common labour pool.  Ireland has to try to become as competitive as the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all of the reasons I have given and the fact that Ireland now has low inflation, there is less need for the kind of amendment proposed than there was at the time Deputy Noonan and Deputy Quinn talked about, the early eighties. The issue is all about setting out objectives, and the Government's objectives are set out.  I remain of the view that the taxpayer has done better than if we had done as is proposed here.  There is only a small amount of money available and the road towards automatic right to all of <Col N="1721" /> the allowances would be the wrong one to take.</P>

      <P>For example, the notion of the CPI being taken into account annually would have the merit of establishing a system that would protect the taxpayer under whatever are the inflationary pressures of the time.  What, one may well ask, prevents the Minister, when framing his budget, from having regard to the fact that he has implemented the CPI in respect of the various bands and allowances? If he were so minded he could take that into account when permitting increased allowances in the following year's budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister is opposed to the amendment because it would deprive him of the cosmetics of reform.  The Minister can now come to the House on budget day and say that he has made additional allowances of a certain order to 700 taxpayers, that he has taken 18,000 entirely out of tax net, and that he has made specific changes.  Until the first pay cheque of the new tax year arrives such statements give the impression of serious tax reductions, if not tax reform.  In many cases that is illusory.</P>
      <P>There is an argument in principle for the indexation of allowances, bands and exemption limits.  If the Government of the day considered that to be a sufficiently generous move to have made for the following income tax year &mdash; and I am not making any comment one way or the other on the merits of that &mdash; so be it. However, that would deprive the Minister of the day from coming to the House to tell people what he was going to give them, because people would already be entitled to the increases under an index-related system.</P>

There is nothing wrong with telling people that they will get a 3.5 per cent increase to compensate for inflation and the rest as an increase. That argument has been made from the word go.  When the Minister started his speech I decided that he had missed the point.  His argument is based on a very false foundation, and if he does not get out of it quickly, he will sink up to his ears in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat what I said.  For any Minister for Finance in this situation it is a question of priorities and the Government have decided on a policy of reducing rates.  We certainly have not ignored other areas but our priority is to reduce rates and to do as much as we can after that.  Fine Gael tax policies also seem to be heading in that direction as they mentioned a rate of 25 per cent and 45 per cent.  I am not sure of the exact amount but their policy in relation to rates is roughly the same as ours.  These policies have been recommended by the Commission on Taxation and indeed it is an international trend.  Of course, if we had all the money in the world we would do everything but when choices are limited because of the amount of revenue available we must have priorities.  One cannot argue with the fact that there have been percentage reductions in tax rates in relation to people working.  Perhaps it adds up in the Tommy Cooper school of economics to which Deputy Browne seemed to refer but the facts are there. We made our choice and, in the end, the Deputy's choice would not be different.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister put forward a thesis which seems to suggest that this amendment is an alternative to reducing rates but I am not saying that.  I object to the Minister finding the wherewithal to reduce rates by not indexing; it is a con job because the value of allowances goes down, the range of the bands remains narrow when it should be widened and the Minister is finding the resources to reduce the standard rate by not giving people the real value of their allowances.  That is the con job which is upsetting more and more people because they now see through it and I do not believe that the Minister will get away with self-financing rate cuts by refusing to index.  That is the point I am making and I do not put them forward as alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of how it will work in practice, <Col N="1724" /> the Minister said he does not have a CPI figure for December but that he does have one for November; November is just as good as December in this regard because the indexation could be put in the Government's estimate of receipts and expenditure early in the year. Indeed, it might also be possible to put in a figure for the indexation of social welfare because, in the last three or four budgets, social welfare was indexed from some time in the middle of the year.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to vary that particular set of policies he should announce changes on budget day.  He could then explain how the estimates of expenditure and receipts have been altered, which would be a much clearer and more satisfactory way of doing business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1. &mdash;Payments in respect of fees paid to recognised third level colleges, together with payments made in respect of the maintenance of students attending recognised third level colleges will be allowed against income tax:</P>
      <P>Provided that no amount greater than the full amount allowed for maintenance under the Higher Education Grant Scheme to eligible applicants, will be allowable against income tax to any taxpayer.  No claim will be allowed in respect of any fee or portion of fee, or any maintenance grant or portion of maintenance grant, already paid by a Local Authority under the Higher Education Scheme.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of the amendment is to enable taxpayers who pay fees to third level colleges in respect of their children or indeed relatives, to claim against income tax those fees and also expenses incurred in maintaining their children who are attending third level colleges, subject to certain conditions.  Obviously, in circumstances where a student is in receipt of a third level higher education allowance a claim could not be made against income tax because the fees would be paid and a grant in respect of maintenance would be paid by the local authority.  My amendment would be of benefit to those who are funding their children through third level education. <Col N="1727" /> As we know, some people are in receipt of partial grants and I have drafted my amendment in such a way as to confine the tax relief to the portion of costs, either fees or maintenance, above the amount the student receives from the local authority, and that the ceiling would apply to the student in either category, that is, a student living within 15 miles of the college or somebody who has to go away to college, who will benefit.</P>
    <P>This should be looked at very seriously. In my view, the third level education grant scheme is one of the greatest scandals in this country.  It operates totally against the interests of the PAYE sector. The way it discriminates against the PAYE sector and in favour of the Schedule D taxpayer has reached such scandalous proportions that local authorities are refusing to publish the names of the recipients of the grants because of the uproar the last publication caused in some areas.  This is an absolute disgrace. The grant scheme will have to be reformed <i>in toto.</i>  My amendment is only an instalment on the way to a full reform of the higher education grant scheme.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for a grant, the applicant has to jump two hurdles: first he has to get a certain academic qualification &mdash; with modifications, four Cs on honours papers &mdash; and second he has to pass the means test.  The means test applies to income only.  The income of the PAYE taxpayer is obvious; the parent produces the P60 and that is the end of story.  The gross income of the PAYE taxpayer is taken into account and many people on very modest incomes are ruled out completely and people on quite low incomes are ruled out partially.  On the other hand, the children of the self-employed will be awarded a higher education grant if their parents can get a tax clearance certificate which shows that their income falls within the ambit of the means test scheme.  Fair enough, but we all know there are advantages in the way the self-employed pay their taxes. However, I will not go into that.</P>
    <P>The real problem with the means test is that families are assessed only on their <Col N="1728" /> income.  Families with assets and with wealth &mdash; indeed, sometimes with very substantial assets &mdash; do not have their assets taken into account when their income is being assessed for higher education grants.  I would go so far as to say that certain persons are deflating their income artificially over certain years to ensure that their children will qualify for higher education grants.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would go so far as to say that it has been known that people transfer income into wealth, in terms of assets so that their income will fall within the means test limit.  This is absolutely discriminatory.  I know public servants on very modest incomes were ruled out completely for higher education grants and I know also that one of the major inducements to take early retirement in the public service was that their children would qualify for higher education grants when they were out on pension. One of the trigger factors across the Civil Service and the teaching profession is that on pension their children would qualify under the means test for third level grants, that device is not available to people in the PAYE sector, but there is a multiplicity of devices available to people who are taxed in other ways.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that people on self-assessment, or people on Schedule D, do not pay their proper tax; I have no information whatsoever that they are not paying their proper amount of tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not even expressing a suspicion.  The nub of the problem is that if means are assessed on income only and assets and everything else are not assessed, then we have a situation which is artificially slanted in favour of one sector against another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also interesting to note what is happening in the wider area of funding third level education.  The regional technical colleges, for example, are now funded by the EC Social Fund.  Funds are <Col N="1729" /> provided for students doing certificate and diploma courses.  There is no means test involved.  Only those students in regional technical colleges following degree courses are not funded from the Social Fund.  Approximately 95 per cent of the students at regional technical colleges are funded from the EC Social Fund and these payments are not subject to a means test.  The fees are covered and students also get a weekly allowance.</P>
    <P>Second, about 35 per cent of university students, as narrowly defined and traditionally known, are in receipt of higher education grants in one form or another. A new scheme called the higher skills scheme was introduced for post-graduate students and people following one year diploma courses in practically everything except Arts, in the sciences, engineering and business subjects have their fees paid by the EC Social Fund, which again is not subject to a means test.  The fees for the famous Accounting Diploma course in UCD, which is very much desired and to which queues of aspirant accountants apply, are paid from the EC Social Fund, even though the accountancy companies, who desire their students to enter these courses, pick up the fees anyway &mdash; but that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>What I am getting at is that the parents of a small cohort of third level students in the universities, as narrowly defined, have to pay full fees and maintenance. This is grossly unfair.  This amendment is a modest proposal to alleviate some of the burden on the PAYE sector.  I am putting it forward as a modest proposal because I know what is really needed is for the Minister for Education to carry out a major reform of the higher education grant scheme.</P>
    <P>It would help if the parents who must pay their children's university fees could claim them against their marginal rate of tax.  It would be helpful if the parents who have to maintain their children whether at home or away from home while attending university could claim the equivalent of the amounts paid in maintenance under the higher education grant scheme against their income tax.  I know <Col N="1730" /> there is some provision already through covenanting in respect of students at university, but there are two problems with covenanting: first, one can only covenant a maximum of 5 per cent of gross taxable income &mdash; whether one has one, two, or three children at university, the 5 per cent limit holds for all.  In other words, one cannot covenant 5 per cent to each of the children at university.  This discriminates against families who are probably more in need than others because of having more than one child at university.</P>
    <P>If a parent or grandparent covenants, the 5 per cent barrier applies but if somebody other than the parent or grandparent covenants there is no limit.  This is grossly unfair.  I have come across cases where, with a shake hands, people coven-and each other's children and the 5 per cent barrier does not apply.  Tax schemes which encourage that kind of activity among respectable, honest people who are pressed into a corner to provide funds for their children who are at university are not good tax schemes.</P>
    <P>What I am saying quite bluntly is that the higher education grant scheme is grossly unfair and will have to be reformed quickly.  If the lists of the names of the recipients of the higher education grant scheme were published in every local authority area I have no doubt that there would be absolute bedlam.  Locals know other locals, they know deserving cases and they know cases which are not deserving.  There are persons in receipt of higher education grants whose parents have a lifestyle which seems to be more extravagant than that of the run of PAYE people who are refused grants, and I will not put it any stronger than that.</P>
    <P>I am sure this amendment will be open to the criticism that it is inadequately drafted, but, I do not pretend to be a draftsman.  I think the intention of my amendment is very clear and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>This is one aspect of life in Ireland where cothrom na Féinne is not received by everyone.  I agree with what my colleague, Deputy Noonan, has said about this matter.  PAYE people may be only £5 over the limit but once they produce their P60 they are deemed to be over the limit.  It is absurd that this system is so black and white.  While the proposal in Deputy Noonan's amendment might be only a gesture, it would at least help hard pressed parents who are just over the limit.</P>
      <P>I referred previously in the House to a student who had gained four A's in his leaving certificate but who, because his parents were £50 over the limit, could not get a third level grant.  It is absurd that this kind of embargo can be imposed on people while others who produce accounts and are over the limit can get a grant.  Obviously there are two standards for assessing the income of people.  It is grossly unfair that parents should have to make a choice about which children should go to university.  Perhaps the first two children will receive a third level education while the third will not because his parents cannot afford to pay.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> It is possible because these parents are prepared to make sacrifices.  I do not know if Deputy Mac Giolla, a city Deputy, will appreciate this but many parents who live in the country believe the only thing they can give their children is education. These parents who have to pay high interest rates to the banks in addition to their income tax see other children getting free education at their expense: they have to pay for their own children's <Col N="1732" /> education and contribute to the education of other children.  Despite what Deputy Mac Giolla says about them in a rather belittling way, I would defend to the last parents who have to make such sacrifices.  I know parents who have deprived themselves of many of the enjoyments of life simply because they want to educate their children.  We should applaud such parents.</P>
      <P>I know from what has happened in my locality what the reaction of people can be to the disclosure of information on who exactly has got third level grants. Nobody begrudges grants to people who deserve them but at times people's patience can run out.  I know of nothing in the education area which can cause as much bitterness as the circumstances in which some people can get grants while others cannot.

      <P>We have heard a dissertation by the Deputies across the Floor about the merits and demerits of the higher education grant system.  If they are so concerned about this scheme one wonders why they did not do something about it while they were in Government. I suspect the reason for this, to which the Minister will probably refer in his reply, is the cost involved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan said that the higher education grant scheme discriminates against the PAYE sector.  I suggest that his amendment would discriminate in favour of the self-employed and the better off in our society.  I do not think this proposal has been very well thought out.  The reason I say this is that many years ago people who could afford it, that is, many of the self-employed and the better off, took out life assurance schemes or used other means to enable them to provide third level education for their children.  They got tax relief on the money they saved at that time.  Deputy Noonan is now proposing that these people should be given tax relief again. This seems unfair and, consequently, his amendment is flawed.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment even though it will only partially solve the problem of funding in the third level area.  There are different inequities in this area.  The first inequity which comes to mind &mdash; this was referred to by Deputy Noonan &mdash; is that students who attend regional colleges do not have to go through a means test system in order to get a grant whereas those who attend HEA colleges do.  I know students who have been offered places in university but could not accept them as they would not get a grant.  Consequently, they were forced to take up courses in regional colleges.  This inequity must be cleared up.  Any child who is offered a place in a HEA college should not be denied that place because of inequities in the funding system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present grant system is totally unacceptable.  We have to put this into context in order to realise just how inefficient and unrealistic it is.  Under the present system a family with three children and an income of £13,700 a year will get no maintenance and will receive only quarter fees.  Yet that family, if they are on PAYE, and pay pension contributions, PRSI and income tax, really only have £193 a week disposable income.  Out of that they are expected to pay maintenance fees which are estimated at £1,300, and a quarter of their college fees estimated at around £1,200. That is totally impossible.  To take it a step further, a family with three children with an income of £15,000 after tax get no maintenance support and no fees.  The maximum grant for fees and maintenance is £3,068.  How could anybody on £15,000 afford to set aside £3,068 towards funding one member of their family in college? In those figures I have not taken into account any mortgage payment.  It is just not possible for parents to meet those demands.  Because of the thresholds as they stand at present there are people who have achieved a place in college on their academic standards but who cannot take the place offered because the State does not provide adequate assistance. That does not demonstrate what we are <Col N="1734" /> supposed to believe in, equality of opportunity for all children.</P>
    <P>The system gives no recognition to the family with two or three children in college. Any child, whether the first, second or third child in a family, should have equal opportunity to fulfil their full potential.  I know of families who, because they are struggling to keep their first child in college, had to decide that their second child would have to either defer taking up a place offered to them or decline the place altogether.  The system must be sensitive to families who have more than one child in college.  If a student is offered a place he should be able to accept it and not be denied it because of lack of funding.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ahearn, I am reluctant to interrupt but the Deputy will appreciate that what is here is a specific amendment referring to financial matters.  It would not be in order for us to use that as an opportunity to debate educational grants which are the responsibility of the Department of Education in co-operation with local authorities. Let us confine ourselves to this rather than debating educational grants, which is not the purpose of this amendment.</P>

      <P>Every point I have made relates to the amendment because the problems I have pointed out can be solved by giving tax relief.  The people I am talking about are taxpayers.  The people who are not taxpayers would be able to get the HEA grant as it stands.  I dwell on those cases because the only way to give relief at the moment is by supporting this amendment and giving them recognition in the form of tax relief for funding students through college.  It is an important amendment.  It is sad to see parents having to remortgage their houses and struggle on insufficient money even for everyday living to try to give their children the opportunity to accept a place that they achieved by hard work. It is important to remedy the enormous inequities between the third level colleges. There must also be a realistic <Col N="1735" /> threshold for higher education grants. Because we do not have them we have to rely on the amendment proposed by Deputy Noonan and resort to tax reliefs.</P>
      <P>Because it is such a crucial issue to so many parents, I urge the Minister to think seriously on it.  It is one means of trying to relieve the enormous burden on parents who are barely over the threshold and who cannot finance their children through college.  Tax relief is just one step towards remedying such inequities.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, like yourself I am amazed at this major debate on educational grants taking place on the Finance Bill.  As Deputy Quinn pointed out, we have very little time left.  I totally agree with the arguments made by Deputy Noonan in regard to inequality such as this, but there is no point in everybody going through them again.</P>
      <P>I am not too sure, however, about the procedure for overcoming this.  I am worried that further allowances against income tax would create further opportunities for tax fiddlers to fiddle.  I wonder if there is not a better way than that to cure the problem which we all know exists.</P>
      <P>Is this the best way?  There would be no difference between the self-employed and PAYE workers.  They could all use the allowances against their income tax. They would all gain and there would be no equalisation.  The purpose is to have equality of access.  The only comment I made throughout &mdash; and it upset everybody on the Fine Gael side &mdash; was that two out of three was not bad.  I can assure Fine Gael Deputies that in families I know where there are none out of three going to college, two out of three would be considered not bad.  I make no apologies for saying that.  By all means the third child should be in with a chance as well, but so should thousands of other children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see that this is the answer. The arguments were not made from the financial end but in regard to inequality <Col N="1736" /> in the education grants scheme.  We all recognise that that is so, but I am afraid I have not been persuaded as yet that this is the best way to overcome it.  They should try to get rid of tax allowances and have a different system of credits.  Every tax allowance is an opportunity for a fiddler and the self-employed already employ accountants and have a better opportunity than the PAYE worker of adapting this allowance to get more out of it.  I am not convinced that this is the best way of overcoming the problem.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the amendment and agree with what previous speakers have said about it.  It takes over £20,000 to keep a student at college over four years.  In some cases students work during the summer and make up the £1,000, so one could say £17,000. A family, with three children, who earn over £15,400 will get no relief on that £17,000 and they will get no grant aid, whereas a similar family in Northern Ireland will get £3,700 a year in similar circumstances.  As previous speakers said, the burden on parents of middle income families at this stage is intolerable and people are forced to remortgage their houses, take out loans or forfeit their life earnings to keep children at college.  That is grossly unfair.  Deputy Ahearn said parents of students are forced to send their children to regional colleges and forego places in university for which they would be suitable.  As a result they are raising the standard in regional colleges and keeping places from students who did not receive sufficient qualifications for third level.  In Northern Ireland entitlement to grants is assessed on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of and sympathetic to the case made for some children who do not have the opportunity of getting to third level because of the way the grants system is structured.  An excellent case was made for an overhaul of the scheme, a total review which my colleague, the Minister for Education, is carrying out at this time.  I would not disagree with much of what Deputy Noonan and other Fine Gael speakers said in relation to inequity. We are all aware of the way the system can work in favour of professional people, people with companies or whatever. Deputy Noonan's suggestion of local newspaper advertisements might draw better results.  However, I am not going into the area of education &mdash; I will leave that for my colleague &mdash; except to say that now we have demonstrated that the scheme is inequitable and has all the shortcomings we are talking about here, surely the way to go is not to throw more money into it to be exploited by those who are exploiting it already and not targeting the people we want to help. This is talking about it the wrong way round.  Apart from the cost and the money aspect, it would not be targeting the right people.  It would be taken up by those who are exploiting the scheme.  I will relay Deputy Deenihan's suggestions <Col N="1739" /> to my colleague, the Minister for Education, for her review of the scheme and the question of income and means.  As Deputy Noonan suggested, we all know the problems.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to give more tax relief.  Most speakers here have said who the people getting the most benefit out of it are and they have asked if we are going to give more to them.  I do not agree with that.  Consequently I am not in favour of this amendment.  The cost of implementing the amendment would be £12 million this year and £20 million in a full year, with no mention of where that money is to come from or what it is to replace.  That is the freedom of Opposition.  They do not have to provide the money for such amendments but this is one of the Fine Gael amendments that add in total about £156 million.</P>
      <P>At a time when most politicians from opposite sides and many commentators are saying we will find it extremely difficult to reach targets this year, surely the provision of £20 million in an area we know is being exploited is not the best use of scarce resources.  The cost of the income tax changes alone in a full year represents £183.9 million and they are a considerable step in the process of implementing the Government's commitment to introduce tax reliefs in the lifetime of the present programme which, as we all know, will add up to £400 million.  Deputy Kenny referred to the programme.  Obviously he has read it and he will see quite clearly this Government's strong commitment to education and to young people.  However, providing additional tax relief is not the way to achieve what is required.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenneally said some people have already made plans for this in advance through life assurance and other schemes and have already picked up tax reliefs in those areas as well.  Is that the way to go?  The total tax cost of the covenants at the moment is £22.4 million, the bulk representing payments for educational purposes.  The cost of the reliefs is already substantial in the Bill; it will be £20 million for a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> I have sympathy with Deputy Browne. I have met such cases as he mentioned and I suppose no representative here has not met some PAYE taxpayer who is £5 over the limit.  It does not matter whether it is £5, £50 or £500, the result is the same. Irrespective of where you pitch the limit, you will always have people saying they are on the wrong side.  If you introduce a new grants system someone will ask why you did not introduce it a day earlier so that some person would have qualified. Unfortunately, those are the realities of life.  It is impossible to accommodate everybody.</P>
    <P>I believe the scheme needs an overhaul, an in depth review such as the Minister for Education is carrying out.  Let us hope that out of that will come a better focus, a better targeting of resources.  As we all know this is costing the taxpayer a significant amount.  We have 66,000 third level students and as Deputies opposite have said, many of them are not means tested because of the ESF.  I am glad this area is being reviewed.  Let us hope it will be much more equitable for the parents who are finding it extremely difficult on small salaries or wages to get their children through third level.</P>

      <P>Is Deputy Noonan satisfied, having ventilated the scandalous inequity in the higher education grants system, to have brought moral pressure on the Minister for Education to take this into account in her review?  He is going to put the rest of us in a difficult position because he chose not to exclude Schedule D taxpayers.</P>
      <P>If the amendment was for the benefit of the PAYE sector only I could see a great deal more merit in it.  The £20 million the Minister referred to would be better used, it seems to me, if he gave it to the Minister for Education to get more grants for working class children rather than spending it in this fashion.  The amendment has highlighted one gross inequity.  In this society nothing transmits privilege as much as education.  Deputy Noonan has highlighted something very important and I hope he is satisfied to have made his case.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would be ruled out of order.  On several occasions I put down amendments where not only was the expenditure side shown but the other side to gather in the revenue was shown also, and I got polite letters from the Ceann Comhairle saying: &ldquo;This amendment is out of order.  Only the Minister for Finance, under the Constitution, can make proposals in the House which levy taxes on the public.&rdquo; It is not a fair argument to throw it back at me and say we are exercising the freedom of Opposition when we are barred under the Constitution from proceeding as you suggest we should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the amendment, I take the point made by a number of Deputies that there would be a possibility, if it was not very carefully framed, that it might benefit people who are already benefiting unduly from a scheme which is operating inequitably.  I have framed it in such a way that there would be no double counting. If someone is in receipt of a higher education grant already, they would not be eligible for the benefit of this amendment because it would not be their parents or guardians who would be paying the money, it would be the local authority.  If somebody was in receipt of a partial grant they could benefit only <Col N="1742" /> from the amount which would be necessary to bring that partial grant up to the £3,068 to which Deputy T. Ahearn referred.  If a Schedule D taxpayer has an income which keeps him within the parameters of this scheme, his child is already receiving the higher education grant and this would be of no benefit to him.  On the other hand, if a Schedule D taxpayer is not getting the grant and has a taxable income which takes him outside the parameters of this scheme, he probably has the same difficulties as PAYE people.  I know it is a rough and ready instrument, but in the absence of any other, it is a move in the right direction &mdash; it is more than a gesture in the right direction because it is a fairly strong proposal.</P>
    <P>Finally, with so many of our very bright, well educated young people emigrating, especially to Europe, a strong case can be made for the Social Fund to be applied not only to regional technical colleges and to the higher skills scheme, which is now effectively the first year of an MA or the first year of an MBA as organised in the universities, but for going back to the Community and saying: &ldquo;we have a number of young people in this country and we want to increase participation rates in colleges up to the European average.  Many of our young people are emigrating and developing your economies. One of the best transfers you could give us is the freedom to apply the ESF funding not only in the regional colleges but also in the universities as traditionally defined.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have the highest respect for the regional colleges.  I do not want to use a term which suggests that one third level system is better than another, that is not what I have in mind.  They do a very good job and we are very fortunate to have such a range of colleges which provide excellent courses.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It seems to be a spurious distinction to have a <Col N="1743" /> student in a regional technical college following a two year diploma course in engineering where his fees are paid out of the Social Fund, and he is receiving a weekly allowance, when somebody else is doing a four year electrical engineering, mechanical engineering or civil engineering course in one of the traditional universities and is not in receipt of EC funding.

      <P>We will proceed now to amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East).</i>  I observe that amendments Nos. 4 and 6 are alternatives.  I suggest, therefore, that we discuss amendments No. 3, 4 and 6 together.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1. &mdash;Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1987 and section 7 of the Finance Act, 1989 shall not have effect as respects the year 1991/1992 and subsequent years of assessment.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The purpose of alternative amendment No. 3 is to restore full mortgage interest relief.  We know that one of the major expenses on households is repaying a mortgage and that when interest rates are high this is a particular burden.  It is particularly a burden for those who took out mortgages when interest rates were low.</P>
      <P>Over the years various changes have been made in the treatment of mortgage interest for tax purposes and tax allowances purposes.  There is a cap on the amount which can be claimed and then, through several budgets, the percentage of the total amount eligible was reduced to 90 per cent under the Finance Act, 1987 and, was later reduced to 80 per cent under the Finance Act, 1989.  Simply by removing section 6 of the Finance Act, 1987 and section 7 of the Finance Act, 1989, the amendment would restore full mortgage interest relief for the 1991-92 tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment mortgage and interest rates are very high.  Members have often talked before in the House about interest rates.  It is difficult to predict what the rest of the year holds, but it seems there will not be any great downward movement <Col N="1747" /> even though a 0.5 per cent reduction was made some weeks ago and was communicated to certain mortgage holders this week.  That reduction was welcome.</P>
    <P>Mortgage interest rates are extremely high and place an onerous burden on young couples in particular.  We know of the difficulties faced by young couples in first putting together a deposit for a home and then in meeting mortgage repayments. Usually the couple are working, which is a satisfactory method of financing the repayments for a while, but when the first child comes along particular pressure is put on them.</P>
    <P>Young married women with children have a particularly tough life when they have to go out to work to provide a second income for the house, usually to pay off the mortgage on the home.  Sometimes one wonders whether they get very much out of all of the effort they put into it.  The House should be sympathetic towards the needs of young couples.</P>
    <P>Most people in Ireland aspire to house ownership, and the mortgage interest relief scheme was a good one in that it enabled people to purchase their own houses.  The most recent figure provided by the Minister for the Environment suggests that about 86 per cent of Irish people own their homes.  That is a very high proportion of home ownership, being very much the highest in Europe. One of the reasons that such a high proportion own their home is the existence of mortgage interest relief.  The capping of the mortgage interest relief scheme, and the reduction of the limit to 80 per cent, has taken away some of the benefit that was available to taxpayers and has made it harder for certain taxpayers to meet their repayments.</P>
    <P>I have previously put down amendments to suggest that mortgage interest relief should fluctuate as interest rates fluctuate, but this year I table a straightforward amendment seeking to restore the relief in full because mortgage rates have been high for a long time and there is no great expectation of a reduction.</P>
    <P>When replying to a previous amendment, the Minister suggested that the <Col N="1748" /> modern European trend is towards the abolition of allowances and lower rates. That would certainly be the argument of the chairman of the other party in coalition with the Minister.  He has made his views on the subject known loudly and clearly.  I note that he never specifies which allowances he would drop.  He is very careful not to say that he is after the mortgage interest relief and intends to add on rates.  We know from the subtext that that is what that person has in mind, but he never actually comes out and admits it.</P>
    <P>It is time we had a real debate about allowances.  I know that the fiscal economists and the tax experts we all have to listen to from time to time regard these allowances as being no longer fashionable. However, it seems to me that it is very good to have allowances that encourage people to buy their own homes in order to house their families.  It is very good to have an allowance that encourages people to insure themselves against ill health.  In my previous amendment I tried to introduce in the tax code an allowance that encouraged people to send their children to university and to help pay for that education.</P>
    <P>A good tax system encourages people to do things that are good for them.  What could be better for people than to have their own house, to maintain their own health and that of their families, and to educate their children?  Why are tax allowances so unfashionable all of a sudden?  They are highly unfashionable at the moment, especially among the Progressive Democrats.  Whom do the Progressive Democrats really represent?  The Progressive Democrats started out by proclaiming themselves as God's gift to the middle classes and as representing middle-class views.  I cannot understand a party with their background threatening to abolish all allowances and saying that mortgage interest relief in particular should be scrapped and that consideration should be given to a property tax.</P>
    <P>Apart from saying that mortgage interest relief should be restored in full, I ask the Minister to explain not only the <Col N="1749" /> position of his party in Government but also that of his partners in Government, who certainly seem to want to reduce the rates of tax even though the price of such reduction is the abolition of all allowances.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself told me in the House about two weeks ago in reply to a question that the cost of the proposals of Mr. McDowell, was just less than £1.3 billion.  The top rate of tax would be reduced to 40 per cent, but that would also include PRSI.  The rate would not be 40 per cent plus 7.75 per cent &mdash; not at all.  He suggested PRSI and tax should be amalgamated, that there should be a standard rate of 25 per cent, but that that would include the higher rate of PRSI and all levies.  The cost of the proposals would be almost £1.3 billion and there is no way to implement such proposals unless all allowances are abolished. There is no hope of even getting into the ball park without abolishing all of the allowances.</P>
    <P>The party who want to clean up local government should first clean up their act and tell the people before the June elections whether they intend to do away with mortgage interest relief, whether they intend to do away with VHI relief, whether they intend to bring back rates and where they stand on all of those issues.  We have listened to propaganda for long enough and it is time to hear some straight answers.  The parties are in Government, and the responsibility is on the Minister for Finance to explain the position of all of his colleagues in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment <Col N="1750" /> No. 3.  From here on the House will be involved in the very difficult business of having to take individual aspects of the tax code and try to make relatively minor improvements.  That is a very undesirable way to approach tax reform.  It is obvious that comprehensive tax reform is required.  Without comprehensive tax reform, one inevitably ends up making special pleadings for sections of the community adversely affected by the existing code.  The House has just dealt with a very substantial section of society who have been so unfairly treated under the higher education grant scheme.  Members are now dealing with a different matter, the preponderant number of householders who are also PAYE earners and who pay the lion's share of taxation.  Last year the Minister, from memory, said that 88.1 per cent of the tax take was contributed by PAYE earners, as compared to more than 1 per cent by farmers and more than 9 per cent by the remainder of the self-employed sector.  I do not know the up to date figures but I do not think they have changed greatly.</P>
      <P>Because the purpose of my approach to tax reform is to try to broaden the base and lift some of the burden from the PAYE sector, and because householders, in the main, happen to be the same PAYE sector, it is important to support this amendment in seeking to have extended to them the full 100 per cent mortgage interest relief.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, appalled that in each of the last two months in succession new all-time records were <Col N="1751" /> reached in the Register of Unemployment, despite the fact that emigration in the latest four years of 136,000 was almost double the 71,000 who emigrated in the preceding four years; noting that unemployment, now standing at 19.7 per cent of the workforce is the highest by far in the EC and more than double the EC average, calls for the establishment of an all-party committee on job creation with responsibility to:&mdash;</P>
    <P> (1)  carry out as speedily as possible an audit of all Government activity to identify and propose changes to any schemes which discourage, or fail adequately to encourage, the creation or seeking of employment and to recommend such steps as it considers appropriate to improve the climate for the creation and maintenance of jobs;</P>
    <P>(2)  propose specific initiatives that can be taken to promote the creation of viable jobs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last month unemployment was at its highest level in history.  To put this in context, the wife of the former United States Ambassador to Ireland, Mrs. Elizabeth Shannon, once said that the Irish totally lack any sense of outrage.  That lack of any sense of outrage could not be better illustrated than by the bored disinterest which everybody, the media, politicians and businessmen, greeted the publication of the worst ever unemployment statistics, under British or Irish rule.</P>
    <P>In March 1991, 246,500 people were registered as unemployed; to ensure comparability with figures for earlier years one must add 5,554 people on a pre-retirement allowance and 2,992 people claiming pre-retirement credits.  In earlier years these two categories would have been included in the overall figure of registered unemployed.  If you include them it gives a total of 254,966 people unemployed here last month, 19.54 per cent of the workforce.  Unemployment never before reached this level, the highest level was 19 per cent in March <Col N="1752" /> 1987.  The figure of 19.54 per cent is all the worse when you consider how many people have left Ireland since March 1987; 136,000 people have left Ireland since Deputy Haughey became Taoiseach; the rate of emigration in the last four years under the Taoiseach has been double that of the preceding four years.</P>
    <P>If the emigrants who left Ireland, unable to find work here since Deputy Haughey became Taoiseach, were included with the unemployed to whom I have already referred, there would be a total number of 391,000 &mdash; 30 per cent of the workforce &mdash; who could not find work here under his Administration.  I contend that in judging any economic policy, the criterion is not the rate of inflation, the balance of payments or any of those abstractions so beloved of the number crunching profession, the judgment of the success of any economic policy is to be found in the number of people who find work &mdash; or who fail to find work &mdash; in the country in question.</P>
    <P>We seem to have very contradictory views about these matters.  In a recent poll 54 per cent of the people said they were satisfied with the Government yet, in research commissioned in 1988, when the question was asked in relation to what politicians could do to make things better, solving unemployment came out top of the list; it had twice as much support as any other matter, including reforming the tax system.  Yet, for some obscure reason, people seem to be satisfied with a Government whose record of unemployment I have just described. Support in that poll for the concept that politicians could and should do something about unemployment was particularly high among Fianna Fáil supporters, twice as high among Fianna Fáil supporters as opposed to the Progressive Democrats.  It was particularly high under the age of 25.  The contradiction of the failure to link dissatisfaction with the level of unemployment with the satisfaction with the Government represents schizophrenia in our society.  However, I &mdash; and the party I am honoured to lead &mdash; intend to put employment and emigration back <Col N="1753" /> at the top of the political agenda.  We will do it by demonstrating that there are things politicians can do about jobs and by demonstrating that voters are not wrong in demanding action on jobs from their politicians.</P>
    <P>Part of the job of the Opposition is to create that sense of outrage, so lacking here, about matters that can be changed but which are not being changed.  I believe there is a consensus among opinion-formers, unfortunately including the Government, that nothing can be done about unemployment and jobs.  This consensus expresses itself in all sorts of different ways; economic commentators congratulate the Government on their success in bringing in a balance of payments surplus and having minimal inflation but they ignore the fact that these two phenomena are accompanied by record unemployment, that is just a detail in their minds.  Yet, a combination of low inflation, a balance of payments surplus and record unemployment would have been summarised in one word &mdash; deflation &mdash; in the economic textbooks I read 25 years ago when I was in college. We have a deflated economy yet no one among our educated élite seems to care. Times have changed a lot in 25 years.</P>
    <P>As I said, unemployment now stands at 254,000 and emigration outlets have now been closed or are closing, yet the labour force continues to grow at 25,000 per year.  If present trends continue unemployment will reach 300,000 in two years' time.  Perhaps by then someone will begin to worry, not perhaps because of the plight of the people concerned but because it will have upset the Government's borrowing targets.</P>
    <P>Lack of a job is the biggest source of inequality in society; the key social issue facing our society today is not the redistribution of income or wealth &mdash; we have reached a limit on redistribution in those areas in the light of free outward movement of capital and labour which will exist after 1992 &mdash; but the redistribution of opportunities to work.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the official consensus that still seems to reign that <Col N="1754" /> nothing can be done about unemployment. There is no better expression of this official consensus than the areas the Fianna Fáil Government have decided should be given tax relief over the last four years.  No new tax incentives have been introduced by Fianna Fáil during the last four years to create jobs. In fact, there have been disincentives in the form of higher PRSI payments for part-time work.  On the other hand, many tax incentives have been introduced to encourage property development, such as the development of hotels, inner city properties, the Temple Bar and the Custom House Docks site.  These have cost huge sums of money.  However, few extra jobs have been created.  Instead, jobs have been shifted from one part of town to another.</P>
    <P>Our tax system seems to have been deliberately designed to discourage small businesses from creating jobs.  The comparative cost of the paper work involved in employing somebody is far higher for a small employer than for a big employer, yet no one sees the need to do anything about this.  All international studies suggest that it is small, not big, employers who will create most jobs in the future. The era of the big organisation as a job creator is over.  The fax machine and the personal computer have ended the reign of the big organisation as a job creator, yet Ireland's tax system is deliberately biased against the new job creator of the future, the small company.  Let me illustrate this bias.  The Commission on Taxation at paragraph 8.8 of their fifth report estimate that the tax compliance costs per job were almost twice as high under our present system among small companies than big companies.  The commission also showed that tax compliance costs in the private sector were more than three times those in the public sector, yet nothing has been done about this since the Commission on Taxation reported. Those are the companies with the greatest potential to create jobs.</P>
    <P>Small employers cannot afford to have a big personnel and legal department to advise them on the maze of industrial <Col N="1755" /> relations law which has been created supposedly to protect existing jobs but it is actually discouraging the creation of new jobs.  In a dynamic world where new jobs naturally replace old ones the effect of our tax and regulatory system, with its high protection of existing jobs and disincentives to the creation of new ones, is inevitably to steadily reduce year after year the total number of jobs in the economy. That is the way we have structured our tax, regulatory and industrial relations systems to discourage the creation of new jobs in order to increase the property value in existing jobs.</P>
    <P>Our policy on company taxation is also biased against jobs.  It was most unwise for the Fianna Fáil Government to guarantee a tax rate of only 10 per cent for manufacturing companies up to the year 2010, in other words, for the next 20 years.  That very unwise decision is at the very core of our industrial policy which is inherently unsuitable to a country like Ireland which has a surplus of well educated labour.  If we want foreign firms to create permanent jobs in Ireland we must get them to set up their research and marketing operations here.  It is only the brain based part of a business, research and marketing, which creates significant numbers of jobs in the country in which they are located, but a low company tax rate policy, 10 per cent, which we have guaranteed to keep for the next 20 years, actually keeps research and development and marketing operations out of the country simply because research and marketing &mdash; think about this &mdash; cost money and they do not produce profits in the country in which they operate.  Things which cost money are expenses against tax.  Therefore, the lower the tax rate the less chance there is that a multinational will locate, they will locate in an area where they can set off expenses for tax purposes.  In fact, the use of the guarantee of a low tax rate of 10 per cent for the next 20 years as the main means of attracting foreign industry reduces the tax incentive to establish research and development and marketing operations in Ireland.  It reduces the <Col N="1756" /> incentive to establish employment intensive manufacturing in Ireland and encourages instead the establishment of mechanised manufacturing operations which generate large amounts of profits which are repatriated and which, with the onset of automation which is increasingly affecting manufacturing, involve little or no employment.  If we continue with this policy, where the human hand is replaced by the machine in the manufacturing operation, we will soon have large numbers of factories producing large profits with very few people employed.  That will be the direct result of the political decision to go for a 10 per cent tax rate for the next 20 years when we could and should have gone for a system of taxation which gave the same number of incentives to industry but in a form which encouraged the multinationals to locate their research and development, marketing and other costs generating activities rather than profit generating activities here.  It is a simple mistake.</P>
    <P>The Government's personal income tax policy is equally anti-job creation. Concentrating all resources, as the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> says, and reducing tax rates to 25p and 40p in the pound while leaving tax bands and allowances unchanged will give considerable benefits to those already at work with a good income but it will do little or nothing to help create new jobs or help people starting work for the first time.  Those starting work for the first time will face a crippling PRSI burden on the first pound they earn and will find that they will reach the higher rate of tax very quickly, far more quickly than they would in any other European country. We have a system which imposes a high tax rate on income from work but which gives tax free status to payments which encourage people to give up work voluntarily in the form of redundancy payments. The effect of this bias in our tax system has been to encourage the sale of jobs and a net reduction in total employment.</P>
    <P>I also believe there is a fundamental anti-job creation bias in the Irish social <Col N="1757" /> system and there is an unspoken conspiracy, most recently expressed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> that no one should speak about it.  Fine Gael intend to speak about it, and that is the reason we put down this motion.  We want an audit of all Government activity to identify and propose changes to any schemes, such as those I have referred to, which discourage or fail adequately to encourage the creation of or seeking of employment and to recommend such steps as they consider necessary to improve the climate for the creation and maintenance of jobs.  We want such an all-party committee to propose specific initiatives which can be taken to promote the creation of viable jobs.  The committee should, if necessary, recommend hard and unpopular decisions which will help to create jobs.</P>
    <P>Let me give some examples of some of the things the committee might recommend which would create more jobs.  I put these forward simply as illustrations to show that there are large numbers of things which can be done and which are not being done because in this country we have talked ourselves into a state of mind which believes that nothing can be done about jobs, that jobs do not matter and that so long as I have my job it does not matter if the other man does not. We have created a conspiracy of silence about jobs.  I recognise that, even speaking here today on this subject, to some degree I am going against the majority consensus which has been created with the aid of the Government and all their admirers who believe that inflation, the balance of payments and matters of that kind are more important than jobs.  A society which fails to create jobs is a failure.  By that standard Irish society, not just the Government represented by one single individual sitting in front of me, but society as a whole, is a failure.</P>
    <P>We have a mental attitude which has created a condition of acceptance of failure in this and many other areas.  We can pride ourselves on the fact that this year Dublin is the European city of culture <Col N="1758" /> and no doubt we will have numerous public relations events celebrating this magnificent achievement.  Dublin is also Europe's city of unemployment, Europe's city of joblessness.  I wonder if that fact will get the same public relations attention from the Government, the Taoiseach and their media advisers.  It is because it will not that we have tabled this motion.  I wish to illustrate some of the things that could be recommended by a courageous Government who want to make decisions, unlike the present Government who simply want to stay in office.  I will outline the measures that should be put forward to deal with this massive social crisis that we face.</P>
    <P>I wish to put forward eight proposals. First, we should scrap IDA grants for machines and buildings and give the same amount of money to the same people in a form of credits against PRSI.  In other words, they would only get the grant when they had employed somebody and they would only get as much grant as PRSI that they had paid on people employed.  We should also, as I have already indicated, change the company tax system to encourage job creation through research and development rather than profit repatriation, which is the objective of our current corporate tax system.  Secondly, we must encourage redundant workers to retrain.  Most redundant workers of any age will never work again unless they retrain. Employers wanting to lay off employees should be required to give them not only a redundancy lump sum but also a retraining voucher, a sum of money that could be used to upgrade skills.  Unfortunately, at present the only body providing training to those who are redundant are FÁS and they only give priority to people who either are long term unemployed or who would probably become re-employed anyway because FÁS have the objective of having good statistics to show.  They have a monopoly, they are virtually the only organisation engaged in providing training for the unemployed.  Monopolies are not the most productive means of <Col N="1759" /> bringing forward new ideas.  Instead of FÁS having a monopoly on training, if each individual who became redundant was given a voucher that could buy £1,000 or £2,000 worth of training that would actually create an active market in retraining for the unemployed.  Firms would compete with ideas for forms of training that would lead to work because they would want to be the beneficiaries of the money the redundant workers had available.  Instead of people having to remain on the dole and on a waiting list for a year or two for a FÁS course by which time they would become demoralised, people becoming redundant would immediately find themselves sought after by a variety of firms who would be willing to offer them a choice of various retraining opportunities.  In my view that system would be better than the present system where retraining the unemployed is monopolised by FÁS.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we can and must get rid of the poverty traps which presently prevent people from taking up work or, indeed, from working more or harder.  The way to do this is to introduce a single graduated means test for all benefits, including benefits like differential rent and others that are currently means tested.  This test would cover graduated entitlements to medical services, higher education grants, free fuel, council rent rebates, family income supplements and also movement to higher rates of tax and PRSI.  One could structure such a single means test in such a way that, for instance, if one's money increased to over £110 a week, instead of losing the medical card altogether and having 100 per cent of one's medical bills paid one would have 90 per cent of them paid and if one moved beyond that to say £130 a week one would have only 80 per cent of one's medical bills paid.  If there was a single unified means test under which the Department of Education, the county council and all State bodies would unify their means test in one national means test we could so design that means test <Col N="1760" />&mdash; it would require a lot of administrative effort certainly &mdash; so that nobody in any part of the country or in any social situation would be worse off, working harder on taking up a job than they would staying in his or her present situation.</P>
    <P>This proposal would not include insurance-based benefits which are not means-tested at the moment and I would not propose that a means test be extended to include them.  It would, however, cover all the existing benefits which are means-tested.  The only obstacle to such a scheme which would make it worthwhile for everybody to work is administrative inertia.  It is the Government's job to deal with that.  The Minister may forget that the Fianna Fáil Party in 1987 promised to simplify and unify means tests.  They promised that four years ago. It was a good idea at the time but they have not followed through with it.  The reason is that the civil servants in the individual Government Departments will not let them.  The Departments will not co-operate one with the other in designing such a scheme and the Government have not got the will or the wish to get the civil servants to do what they know and recognised in 1987 as necessary to remove poverty traps.</P>

      <P>Fourthly, if we want to deal with the employment problem we can keep more people at school.  Education is the key to employment.  There is only 3 per cent unemployment among those who are university graduates and only 6 per cent among those who have the leaving certificate as against 30 per cent unemployment among those who left school without any qualifications.  At the moment there are jobs remaining unfilled because of the lack of applicants. Demand for computer staff rose by 61 per cent last year while the demand for conventional office staff dropped by 23 per cent.  The opportunities are there if the training and education is right but our educational and training system is failing us as far as filling those vacancies is concerned. The proportion of Irish 18 to 20 year-olds still in education or college is far below that on the Continent and there must be a direct link between that fact and the fact that we have the highest level of unemployment in Europe, yet places in school do not cost more than spaces on the dole queue and they are a far better passport to work.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest disappointments of the recent <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was its failure to come up with any proposals for a comprehensive apprenticeship system, like the German system, covering all occupations and providing a sensible mix of education and work with a specific employer.  Ireland is also spending a smaller proportion of its EC Structural Funds on training than either Spain or Portugal and that, in view of the labour surplus we have here, is something the Minister for Labour ought to explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important if people are to work, that they can read and write.  A 1985 study showed that 30 per cent of those entering second level schools, having spent eight full years in the Irish educational system, were still backward readers in the English language.  I do <Col N="1762" /> not have figures on their competence in reading Irish on which they would have spent even more time than they spent learning to read English, but the fact that 30 per cent were unable to read English properly after eight years in the educational system is surely a damning indictment of our educational system. Such people entering second level schools unable to read or write properly are virtually certain to spend the rest of their lives unemployed in modern society.  The easiest, the quickest and the most appropriate intervention that the State can make to prevent people becoming long term unemployed is to ensure that no child leaves a national school in Ireland unable to read or write.  We should aim by 1997 to have achieved a situation in which no child will leave a national school anywhere in Ireland unable to read or write properly.</P>
    <P>I contend that to achieve this we need a systematic national test to identify those in need of remedial reading at the age of eight.  There should be a test of all children, even if some teachers feel that their classroom methods are being subjected to objective outside scrutiny, which they do not welcome.  We need a national test to identify in time those children who need help.  If we want to guarantee a permanent underclass people unable to hold down a permanent job ever, we can continue to allow children to leave our national schools unable to read or write.  The introduction of a systematic national test is the simplest, quickest and most effective thing we can do, to ensure that we reduce our level of long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, we can make it more attractive for employers to take on extra staff. Absenteeism would be cut if sick pay was part of normal income for tax purposes, as is already the case in Britain.  Because sick pay is tax free sometimes people find it more attractive at particular times of the year to be off sick than to be at work.  By so doing they undermine the competitiveness of the business for which they work and ultimately create a situation <Col N="1763" /> in which their employer wishes to replace staff with machines which do not go off sick.</P>
    <P>We should also consider allowing trade unions to agree with particular employers to dispense with the Unfair Dismissals Act for extra employees taken on as part of an agreed job creation programme.  I want to stress that trade unions would have to agree to such a proposal.  Of course, these ideas will not be popular with everybody &mdash; Deputy Spring has criticised them &mdash; but the fact is that our present system, from industrial relations law to education, is biased against job creation and is mainly aimed at protecting the property rights of those who are already employed at the expense of job creation for those who are currently unemployed or still at school.</P>
    <P>Sixthly, we should encourage the creation of part-time job opportunities by allowing the social employment scheme to be extended to cover groups of private individuals taking people off unemployment to do part-time home-based work, such as child care, home maintenance, house work, gardening, etc. Another way of encouraging this would be to give a tax relief for home based work.  Social employment schemes are one means and tax relief is another &mdash; it is six of one and half a dozen of another. There are huge opportunities for home-based work in our society and what we need to do is to bring that work into the white economy and out of the black economy.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, some in this House who would have an ideological objection to anyone employing people to do this sort of home-based work.  Such people with that ideological view would not object to a well off person spending their money on a foreign holiday or a video but believe that spending money creating a job for a person in their home is not the done thing.  Those people are wrong.  A country which has such a high level of unemployment should use every means, including giving incentives to <Col N="1764" /> people to create employment in their own homes, to create more work opportunities for our people.  We should do everything we can to divert the pattern of consumption of expenditure by our people away from buying things towards buying services which our people can provide, away from spending money on imports, including foreign holidays, towards buying the services people can provide here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Seventhly, we should deliberately set out to encourage the taking up of part-time or temporary work by the long term unemployed.  I propose that there should be a social welfare official in every employment exchange area with the specific job of encouraging people who are unemployed to take up part-time or temporary work opportunities instead of, as happens at present, penalising them by knocking them off unemployment benefit for six weeks while the matter is investigated if they happen to take up a temporary job.  Officials in the Department of Social Welfare should be encouraging people to take up part-time job opportunities. Part-time or temporary work is frequently the only passport towards a full-time job for anyone who has been unemployed for a long time.</P>
    <P>Eighthly, and very importantly, we should gear our income tax system towards the solution of the job crisis in Ireland.  In order to encourage job creation we should consider having a third new introductory tax rate of just 15 per cent for the first tranche of income which people earn after taking up a job or for those who are on a low income. This would help create jobs as it would reduce the tax burden on people taking up a job for the first time and reduce the tax burden borne by those who are employed on a relatively low wage.  The likelihood is that the first job a person who has been unemployed for a long time will be offered will be for a relatively low wage.  If such people are offered a job at present they are taxed as if they were semi-millionaires.  This system should be changed.  Instead of following the <Col N="1765" /> Government's policy of a 25p rate and a 40p rate which would be of considerable benefit to the well off and of disproportionate benefit to people the better off they are, we should follow a structure of tax rates which deliberately favours people who are marginal, whether employed or not.  The introduction of a 15 per cent tax rate for people coming off unemployment who are likely, in their first job, to be offered a relatively low wage would be biasing our income tax system for the first time for many years in favour of the creation of work rather than the assuaging of the concerns of those who are already at work.</P>
    <P>I make no dogmatic claims for any of the eight proposals I have made tonight. There may, indeed, be difficulties with some of them.  This is the sort of thing an all-party committee, which this motion proposes, could be engaged in solving. My central point is that politicians can do something about unemployment.  This requires more than just the piecemeal giving out of grants to foreign or domestic businessmen.  It requires the systematic changing of all the rules under which our economy and society work, to make them favour job creation rather than discourage it.  Every regulation, tax and pound of public spending should be tested against the single criterion &mdash; does it make it easier or more difficult to create jobs?</P>
    <P>At present we have the Committee of Public Accounts who audit all public spending to see if money is wasted or spent illegally.  We need even more a Dáil committee who would do a once-off audit of all Government spending, taxation and social and economic legislation and to recommend changes in the areas which discourage job creation.  It is vitally necessary that we do this if we are to overcome the sense that we in Leinster House can do nothing about the job crisis in our society.  We have the opportunity both today and tomorrow of doing something, of showing that we are willing to do something about the job crisis by pooling the talents of all parties in this House <Col N="1766" /> in a committee in which all ideological viewpoints would be represented.  If we sincerely believe that something can and should be done about unemployment, why not get together and do it?</P>
    <P>There may be some in this House who would worry about the cost of some of the measures I have proposed which would help to create jobs.  They would argue that we should not go for any quick fixes so far as employment is concerned. However, if we look at the figures for our birth rate, we can see that temporary measures of the kind I have recommended are economically justified.  By the year 2000 there will be 50,000 people fewer between the ages of 15 and 24 than there are today.  The jobs crisis may be extremely acute at present and it may get even more acute before this decade is much older, but it will not last forever. We are, therefore, justified in taking exceptional measures as a society in the next four to eight years to tilt the balance in favour of job creation.  This should come before all other priorities.  For that reason it is my responsibility and duty to propose this motion to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> I welcome the opportunity to talk to you this evening about measures to tackle unemployment.  Tackling unemployment and the creation of new jobs remain the top priority of the Government and all our policies are aimed at creating the right climate for business and investment and hence increased employment.</P>
    <P>We have been uniquely successful as an economy in recent years and I would like immediately to remind you of some of these achievements.  Economic growth in this country in the period 1987-90 exceeded the EC average at more than 4 per cent per annum.  Last year economic growth was of the order of 6 per cent. The debt/GNP ratio has been reduced from 131 per cent in 1987 to 111 per cent at end-1990.  Inflation has stayed at 3 per cent and the latest figure at 2.6 per cent is the lowest in the European Community and less than half of the rate in the UK. The differential with German interest rates in 1987 was 9 per cent.  Now it has been reduced to just over 1 per cent, although real interest rates still remain unduly high.  Exchequer borrowing has fallen dramatically from 13 per cent of GNP to 2 per cent of GNP.  Our balance of payments deficit of £500 million in 1986 has been transformed into a surplus of £700 million in 1990.</P>
    <P>Before I came into the House today I saw the first quarter figures for 1991 and that has emerged positively with the value of exports up by £97 million on the first quarter.  Even though there was a marginal decline on the surface that is still extremely successful.</P>
    <P>These are achievements which cannot be denied and the facts I have mentioned speak for themselves.  Coupled with these achievements is the fact that workers got real increases in wages and the benefits of social welfare recipients were protected from inflation.  Apart from that, we have had a prolonged period of relative industrial peace.</P>
    <P>Let us compare for a moment the scenario I have just outlined with the position earlier in the eighties.  I accept the point <Col N="1768" /> Deputy Bruton made about what bankers and industrialists say with regard to the figures.  At every seminar I attend in the private sector, I continually remind them of the unemployment figures.  We have to look at the earlier figures.</P>
    <P>There has been a complete turnaround in our economic fortunes.  The hopelessness of the early eighties which went so far as to challenge our political institutions has been replaced by a new found optimism.  The clear facts of the matter are that we are pursuing the right policies and must continue to do so at all costs. We must beware of resorting to emergency pump priming measures which have proved useless in the past and which have been completely discredited.  There must be no question of undermining investor confidence.</P>
    <P>We were all aware that there would be a slow-down this year.  The Gulf crisis has had a very unsettling effect, notably on tourism.  The international recession has been deeper than expected, particularly in the case of the UK where the labour market has been badly hit.  UK output is set to decline by 2 per cent this year, with a fall in investment of about 10 per cent. The recession in turn has led to a fall off in emigration &mdash; which is the main reason for the increase in the live register in the early months of this year.</P>
    <P>The present slow down is not, however, an indication of policy failure on our part.  It does not signal that we need to alter course.  On the contrary, our dependence on international trade emphasises the fact that we must stick to an approach which ensures we remain competitive in foreign markets.  The fundamentals of the economy are right.  We have a stronger competitive position as a result of present policies.  Our macroeconomic policy instruments are correctly aligned &mdash; our exchange rate is strong, our credit rating has improved and we have the correct balance of fiscal and incomes policies.</P>
    <P>Significant gains in productivity have been achieved since 1987, and the two years to 1989 saw an increase in industrial <Col N="1769" /> output which was almost double that witnessed over the previous seven; compared with its main trading partners, Ireland's labour cost competitiveness improved by 18 per cent in common currency terms; OECD forecasts expect Ireland to have the lowest unit wage cost increases in the business sector of all OECD countries over the 1991-92 period.</P>
    <P>In the increasingly competitive world of today we must not, however, rest on our laurels.  We must continue to identify and implement policies which improve economic efficiency.  In contrast to the uncertain nature of developments abroad, enterprise in Ireland can rely on the continuation of sound economic policies here at home.  The Government are absolutely clear that the successful fiscal and monetary strategy of the last four years must continue.  Even this year, in the depth of a world recession we expect to achieve positive economic growth. When the recessions in the UK and the US bottom out, we will be in a unique position to take advantage of the recovery when it occurs.  Indeed, there are already some positive features in the world economy from our point of view.</P>
    <P>In the first place, there has been a quick and decisive ending to the Gulf War which has resulted in international air traffic and tourism moving towards more normal activity patterns.  Investor confidence is improving.  The strengthening of the dollar has improved our competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United States, which should boost exports to, and tourism from, the USA.</P>
    <P>When the world economy returns to growth later this year, which is predicted by economists, I expect the Irish economy to reap similar or even greater benefits than we saw during the last four years. We should again attain growth levels of the order of 4 per cent or 5 per cent and further increases in net employment.  Just as the recession abroad has led to an increase in unemployment in almost all countries, I expect the end of that recession to show an upswing in job creation. I am confident, therefore, that the present increase in the live register is <Col N="1770" /> a temporary phenomenon which will be rectified as economic growth returns to the UK and the US and the effects of the Gulf War wear out.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that the latest Labour Force Survey indicated that the numbers at work increased by 30,000 in the year to April 1990.  This represented an increase of 3 per cent on the previous year and, as such, easily outstripped the average rise in the European Community over the same period.  Over the period of the PNR, industry created a net 22,000 new jobs and the services sector created a net 17,000 &mdash; even after the 30,000 drop in public sector employment.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the main reason for the rise in unemployment is the fall in emigration.  This has been shown in the social welfare figures.  The Government inherited both the economic conditions which led to emigration and a pattern of increase in involuntary emigration among those who could not find employment here.  The upward trend peaked in the year beginning April 1988, for which the net outward migration figure was 46,000. By 1989, when Government policy aimed at creating a firm basis for the growth of the economy had begun to take effect, net outward migration figures showed a dramatic 30 per cent decline on the previous year.  I anticipate that net migration for the year just past, to April 1991, could be as low as 15,000.</P>
    <P>The adverse employment situation in Britain and elsewhere has, of course, contributed to this decline in outward migration.  So, too, has the fact that unemployed Irish people now realise that our social welfare system is such that they are treated better here than if they were unemployed elsewhere.  The changes made in the UK welfare system over the last two years were raised in this House.</P>
    <P>I think that another reason for the decline in emigration is the widespread belief that the current unemployment situation is only a temporary set-back, mainly due to the external circumstances which I have mentioned elsewhere. When these conditions have abated, I would expect that the employment situation at home will again improve as <Col N="1771" /> rapidly as it had been before the Gulf crisis.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, it is true that the sudden and steep decline in outward migration means that each year in the last two years at least an additional 15,000 persons opted to remain in Ireland.  In many ways we are very glad of that.  It raises the figures.  I have been continually on the record of this House for the last four years as saying it is far better we provide the service, facilities, training and education to keep our young people at home than seeing them emigrate to be on the registers in other countries. In a small labour market like ours the option to remain at home, has a major impact, especially when coupled with the fact that our labour force is still growing rapidly.</P>
    <P>The programme negotiated in the early part of this year has set out the macroeconomic strategy for the immediate future with the twin objectives of economic growth and social equity.  That is what it is based on.  Without growth in the economy there will be no growth in jobs.  Growth in jobs is the only real solution to unemployment and emigration. Regardless of the temporary difficulties in the international trade environment, the Government are determined to press ahead with their commitments under the programme.</P>
    <P>The basic strategy underlying the programme is simple &mdash; improving the macro-economic climate, stimulating economic growth and promoting social progress.  The achievement of these objectives requires the co-operation of all the major economic and social interests in society.  Social consensus has been the cornerstone of this Administration's approach to tackling the major problems which confronted us when we came into office.</P>
    <P>The key objectives of the long term strategy in the programme are, first, a substantial increase in employment and second, a major assault on long term unemployment.  These objectives will be achieved through a combination of macro-economic stability policies geared to low inflation, low interest rates and <Col N="1772" /> reduction of the national debt. We expect sectoral new jobs as follows: 60,000 over the three year period &mdash; 20,000 per year &mdash; in manufacturing and international services, and 15,000 over the three year period in tourism.</P>
    <P>I want to mention some issues because I do not altogether disagree with some of the points made.  Deputy Bruton was constructive.  Often in Dáil debate Deputies say why we cannot do this, that or the other.  At least Deputy Bruton put forward issues for debate &mdash; some of them new, he said &mdash; and we do not disagree with some of them.</P>
    <P>Employment is the priority. Reductions in capital grants have already happened.  A shift from capital grants to employment grants, marketing and other forms of support has already been undertaken. We want grants assessment on a per-job basis, capital grants paid only on achievement of job targets and accelerated capital allowances reduced to 25 per cent from April 1991 and eliminated in April 1992.  Other tax provisions, such as the 10 per cent manufacturing tax rate, the BES, and section 84, have been tightened up.  I have listened to Deputy Bruton's arguments and I am sure my colleagues in Industry and Commerce will give the reasons the Government made their decisions on the 10 per cent tax rate.</P>
    <P>Looking at the growth in employment and the downturn in net emigration, it is clear that the policies being pursued by the Government with the endorsement of the social partners are basically sound and correct.  We should not allow ourselves to be deflected from the recovery path by temporary difficulties or to adopt panic measures which, while affording temporary relief, could do little or nothing to tackle the structural problems of the economy in the long term.  We tried that.  Successive Governments tried it and failed.  When the rest of the world was coming out of the recession in the last 15 years this country was always at a disadvantage and unable to move quickly to profit from this economic growth because we had undertaken temporary <Col N="1773" /> measures which had our finances in disaster. Surely no senior politician advocates that we try that road again.</P>
    <P>Remedial action must accord with and complement the strategy and objectives encompassed by the programme.  Any other action would be counterproductive. We are exploring a rearrangement of initiatives which will provide temporary relief while contributing to medium-term objectives.  Firms have responsibility to retain their employees during short term difficulties rather than resorting to the expedient of laying off workers.  Management should use slackness in demand to retrain workers, to upgrade their skills and to prepare for the pick up in business which is already apparent.  Otherwise, increased demand will coincide with pressure for retraining, and we know the tensions that can lead to.</P>
    <P>On industrial relations, it is imperative that any form of disruptive industrial action be avoided if at all possible.  It is difficult enough in good times to persuade foreign companies and, indeed, Irish firms to invest in this country in the expansion and development of business as a means of creating jobs, but when we elected to shoot ourselves in the foot by industrial action with consequences completely out of proportion to the issues involved, the task of attracting investment to create jobs is rendered very difficult indeed.  I will say no more about that.</P>
    <P>We have had a period of unprecedented industrial peace in the last few years and we must keep it that way, or even improve.  As Deputy Bruton said, we must concern ourselves not only with those in employment, or who are relatively well off, but with those who are socially disadvantaged and suffering deprivation of one kind or another. Those in a privileged position &mdash; that is, all of us with jobs &mdash; should do nothing to undermine the task of assisting others. We have had a recent illustration of what I mean.</P>
    <P>There is a lesson to be learned from mistakes made by taking industrial <Col N="1774" /> action.  If we want to develop the economy to create jobs and reduce unemployment we must avoid indulging in industrial relations hara-kiri.  This imposes a major obligation on employers and on trade unions to act responsibly and to avoid inflicting serious damage on their colleagues and fellow workers.  If we have learned such a lesson, it would be at least one positive outcome of recent disputes and provide for a more secure industrial relations foundations to recover the output and employment that have been lost.</P>
    <P>On recent developments in manpower services, lest it be said we are doing nothing, FÁS now offer a very comprehensive service to the public through the &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; approach.  Major programmes have been reviewed and targeting improved.  Services are now provided in a more efficient and cost effective manner.  Time will prohibit me from answering all the points raised by Deputy Bruton, but I would like to do so some other time.  A large part of FÁS training is not for those who are unemployed; about 40 per cent is for people who are not on the live register &mdash; women, school leavers, people who are not eligible for social welfare and have benefit.  FÁS are not there just for the long term unemployed or for those who have been unemployed for a year or two, as Deputy Bruton said.</P>
    <P>A large part of FÁS training is external. That is the part on which I am normally criticised in this House and asked if we are getting the best value for money. To advocate, as Deputy Bruton did, that FÁS should not have a monopoly when it comes to training may have merit for discussion and debate.  At times I have thought that might be something to look at, but it is a recipe for all kinds of difficulties. Difficulties arise when people analyse who the trainers are and what their credentials are.  I have the pleasure and honour to serve in a Government who have analysed that aspect in recent years.  Point six could be a recipe for disaster if it was to be followed through.</P>
    <P>FÁS also operate overseas through a <Col N="1775" /> subsidiary company.  I want to acknowledge the good work they are doing in that area alone where they cover about 40 jobs.  FÁS are finalising their arrangements to implement the new apprenticeship system which is outlined in the programme.  I am glad to say employers have recently indicated support for a payroll levy in certain sectors to part finance the new system.  It is hoped to introduce this new system on a pilot basis later this year and in due course it should assist an additional 1,000 young people to obtain quality training.  This training will carry a certification which will be readily recognised both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The quality and productive capacities of our workers is a major determinant of competitiveness of our enterprise.  I agree with Deputy Bruton on that.  The quality of our work force depends to a large extent on their training.  The primary responsibility for training those in employment rests with enterprises.  Figures prepared for FÁS in 1989 showed that in the previous year 42 per cent of the 961,800 persons employed in industry and services, excluding the public sector, received training.  The quality and productive capacity of our workforce is a major determinant of the competitiveness of our enterprises.  I agree with Deputy Bruton on that point.  The quality of our workforce depends to a large extent on their training and the primary responsibility for training those in employment rests with enterprises.</P>
    <P>Figures prepared for FÁS in 1989 showed that in the previous year 42 per cent of the 961,800 persons employed in industry and services &mdash; excluding the public sector &mdash; received training.  Only half of these received training off the job and that is a very low figure.  This is not enough to help us keep up, let alone catch up, with more advanced countries.  I do not deny that more work needs to be done in the training area.  That is something I have been saying for some time.  This is very clearly the case in comparison with the UK.  Ireland seems to fall behind because of the relatively small number of <Col N="1776" /> large companies which in other countries play a major role in continuing vocational training.</P>
    <P>With regard to what needs to be done to train employees &mdash; as against what is being done &mdash; FÁS-sponsored research contains the following elements: 45 per cent of employees in industry need further training; further training is required for all occupational groups; the needs vary by occupational group, and are very extensive; and management skills in Irish industry are inadequate and insufficient. We are dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>I know that the question of a more structured approach to training generally has been raised in the Central Review Committee recently.  The possibility of moving towards the German &ldquo;dual system&rdquo; model &mdash; to which Deputy Bruton referred &mdash; which is enterprise driven, has been examined.  There has been agreement to discuss the question further when the arrangements for the reformed apprenticeship, including funding mechanisms, have been agreed.  I welcome such discussions.  I believe we can build on the partnership approach which is the basis of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in further developing the Irish workforce.</P>
    <P>Our situation on the geographical periphery of the Community will always involve costs for ourselves above that of other European countries.  That is a fact of life.  This places a greater requirement on us to develop those areas and key sectors where we could have a comparative advantage and develop those resources that would contribute to this process.  Our workforce is such a resource.  Employers must take account of the link between training, productivity and competitiveness.  That is precisely what Government policies and our training policies do.</P>
    <P>The total figure of around £3 billion from the European Communities under the Structural Funds in the period between 1989 and 1993 will result in increased employment.  The funds will allow us to develop agriculture, tourism and industrial relations and human <Col N="1777" /> resources.  It is clear we will continue to need such assistance even after 1993 if we are to address regional disadvantage in the new Europe.  Meanwhile, we are working to improve the effective links between training and other development policies.</P>
    <P>A crucial factor in achieving quality and competitiveness lies in the quality of our managers and their ability to expand and maintain enterprises.  This has two aspects.  First, managers should be vitally concerned about improving their own performance through appropriate development and training courses.  The Galvin committee reported on that.  The message is a clear but important one for Irish enterprises.  Good managers make sound enterprises and good management education, training and development programmes make good managers.  Poor management leads to failure and job losses.  Second, managers must use their skills to increase their markets abroad and at home, to spot opportunities and to constantly monitor the market.  Now is the time to review those strategies. In this breathing space managers should now be laying the foundations for a full assault on the European market as we approach 1992.  I appeal to them in this debate to view the present situation not as a set back but as an opportunity to gear up for the expected recovery so as to capitalise fully in terms of market share, profitability and employment in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>Unemployment impacts differently on different geographical areas and different groups.  I agree with the comments of Members of the House about those who suffer on the periphery.  A most worrying development since the start of the eighties is the increase in long term unemployment and indeed its tendency to build up local concentrations.  We can trace that back to the severe economic downturn of the mid-seventies which led to a doubling of the figures and the recession in the early eighties.</P>
    <P>The increasing numbers of new entrants to the labour market have made job-seeking a more competitive undertaking. Those who are less well able to <Col N="1778" /> compete for the jobs on offer find themselves being pushed down the queue of the unemployed, becoming long term unemployed.  Once a person has become long term unemployed it is clearly more difficult for him or her to get a job.  That is a statistical fact.  Large-scale redundancies in traditional sectors and a very much reduced demand for unskilled labour due to industrial restructuring have also contributed to long term unemployment. The effects of long-term unemployment manifest themselves at various levels, economic, social, personal and also at the wider community level.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme is the principal manpower programme to assist the old and long term unemployed.  This programme undertakes work of benefit to the local community while, at the same time it helps participants to regain a foothold in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The experience of the long term unemployed in local blackspots has forced a shift in the perspective of policy-makers. Because of the multi-dimensional problems associated with long term unemployment, the need to combine the efforts of the various agencies concerned at local level is seen as an important element in any approach to addressing the problem.  The value of an integrated approach to unemployment was also stressed in the NESC report, A <i>Strategy for the Nineties,</i> and was taken on board in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>In March last the Government approved the arrangements for initiating the area based response to long term unemployment which was outlined in the programme.  The initiative represents a new approach in this country to tackling long term unemployment.  The only other European country that has done something similar is Sweden.  FÁS have examined their model extensively and have taken the good parts from it.  The new strategy will focus on individual areas, using the local communities as the primary actors.  It will integrate at the local level the various existing initiatives already in place.  Your own area, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is one of the areas of <Col N="1779" /> high unemployment which will be examined. That area was chosen because it has one of the highest unemployment rates in Ireland.  The new programme will involve a progression, in particular to ensure second chance education, leading to qualifications and, therefore, with greater possibility of a job.  The scheme will not be compulsory.</P>
    <P>A national team representative of the employer organisations, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, FÁS, and the Departments of Education, Social Welfare and the Taoiseach has been established to organise the project and to monitor and co-ordinate the activities of individual local companies.  The national team is operating initially on a whole-time basis and is at present engaged in a series of meetings with representatives of local communities and other interests, including the unemployed, from the 12 pilot areas to hear their views on the formation of the local companies.  The companies will be full companies limited by guarantee.  They will comprise six people from the local community who are already involved in employment action groups, six from the statutory agencies and six representing the private sector.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that there are 14 million people in the European Community who are unemployed, seven million of whom are considered to be long term unemployed, we in Ireland have over 100,000 such people.  We are the only country in the Community which has followed on an initiative passed during the Irish Presidency, which became part of the NESC report, <i>A Strategy for the Nineties,</i> and also was included in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  It was partly funded in the budget and is now Government policy.  That is as good a response as anyone can expect, but whether it will work is another matter.  It is a sincere effort by the private sector, by the social partners generally and by the public voluntary agencies and, most important, it includes the ordinary people on the ground who are interested in their community and who are endeavouring to <Col N="1780" /> stimulate investment, hope and confidence in their own community.  It is deserving &mdash; as I said here recently in a previous debate of support by all the Members of this House.  I am glad of the opportunity of this debate to put some of these details on the record because everyone outside this House supports this initiative and it requires our assistance.</P>
    <P>I accept there have been increases in unemployment in recent months as measured by the live register, as there have been in every European country.  I believe, however, that these increases are temporary and that the pick-up in world trade now beginning to appear will enable us, if we hold our nerve, to resume the outstanding employment growth we achieved in the period 1987-90.  We can do this if we do not run away from policies and if we do not undo all the good that has been done.  I have no intention of running away from that responsibility. That would be a disaster and the unemployed will suffer more than anyone else if we do not implement our excellent policies.  We must do more and we must continue to work hard.  Independent and international commentators say we can expect an end to the recession in the UK and in the US later this year.  Expansion would also be assisted by a lowering of real interest rates internationally.  That would help us greatly.  My conviction is that the policies contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are the right policies, and they form the basis for significant medium and long term economic and employment performance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton put forward his points constructively and calmly and I will certainly consider those which relate to my Department.  I am sure my colleagues in the Department of Industry and Commerce, and other Departments, will deal with the points that relate to those Departments.</P>

      <P>My amendment states:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;establishment of&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;an Economic and Social Affairs Committee of the Oireachtas, to, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
      <P> (1) carry out a full and thorough review of industrial policy, with a view to identifying all areas in which policy measures are failing to produce investment and jobs, and the policy measures necessary to promote the growth and development of indigenous industry;</P>
      <P>(2) ensure that all the implications of the Single European Market are fully assessed, and all policy measures necessary to maximise the benefits of a more integrated Europe, including the demand that economic and monetary union must be accompanied by new measures to promote social cohesion and the establishment of an additional fund to achieve social and regional objectives;</P>
      <P>(3) in conjunction with the Government and the social partners, to develop a positive action programme of job placement for the long term unemployed as an integral part of the area-based pilot schemes announced in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress;</i></P>
      <P>(4) and having regard to the latest findings that Ireland has a more serious problem of urban poverty than most of the rest of Europe, to develop a strategic plan to address this crisis through fundamental reforms of our taxation and social welfare systems;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5) examine the potential for extending job-sharing and worksharing, contributing to a reduction in <Col N="1782" /> unemployment, through tax incentives and cash payments to employees and employers, to promote solidarity contracts between the employed and the unemployed, to achieve a more just distribution of available paid work&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton talked about an eight point programme which deserves some consideration.  The scrapping of the IDA grants for machines is long overdue.  The emphasis has been on the provision of plant and premises to the detriment of job creation.  I have yet to see any of the targets set by the IDA being achieved in any industry brought into this country.  I welcome the shift in emphasis.</P>
    <P>In relation to retraining redundant workers FÁS are doing an excellent job, but the jobs are not there.  Some people who have been made redundant have done more than one FÁS course and yet have not secured jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to getting rid of the poverty traps, something I wholeheartedly welcome.  The graduated means test is particularly needed with regard to education grants.  If the parent of an education grant applicant exceeds the cut-off point in any week, it is possible the student will be deprived of the whole grant.  This trap should be eliminated.  A contributing factor to the poverty trap has been the manner in which young unemployed people living with the parents are assessed.  Their entitlement is based on parents' income.  This is creating a major problem in that young unemployed people are being forced out because unemployment assistance is based on the parents' income.  That is an unjust system.  If we are to rid ourselves of the poverty trap that should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton placed much emphasis on education at national school level and, perhaps, there are literacy and numeracy problems at that level.  A problem arises in that guidance teachers come in at second level.  In many cases the children in greatest need of guidance do not go to second level and, therefore, never encounter a guidance teacher.  There should be a shift in emphasis in that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> We are producing highly skilled people from our second and third level institutions. They are among a large percentage of the people forced to emigrate. Our top performers cannot secure employment and that is a serious loss to the country.</P>
    <P>In recent years we moved away from the traditional type of apprentice training. This left a void in the educational system which has in some way contributed to the fact that we have few indigenous engineering industries.  In the past people who went through the technical school system were successful in business.  They may have lacked business acumen and bookkeeping skills but they had the skills necessary to set up in business. If Deputy Bruton's points provoke a debate on this issue they are welcome. Having been a chairman of a VEC I very much regret the shift from apprenticeship training.  The training we give does not provide the craftsmen we will require should there be an upturn in the economy. Present day training systems do not provide the tradesmen of the calibre we had in the past.  This also contributes to the poverty trap and does not help in job creation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said that to make it more attractive for people to go to work, the trade unions should agree to waive the Unfair Dismissals Act.  That would create a minefield and I could not go along with it, not for ideological reasons but for commonsense reasons.  I would discourage that approach.

      <P>I take you at your word, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I feel that we should tread warily when talking about the Unfair Dismissals Act and the wording of that legislation.  The Act was introduced after much agonising and much campaigning from trade unionists down through the years.  To throw it aside on the basis that jobs might be created would do a disservice to the people who are employed at present and would leave those who are unemployed open to exploitation.  For that reason I have to reject the idea out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton spoke on section 6 of his proposal regarding home-based employment.  The greatest abuse in all employment throughout the world has been in home-based employment.  That has been experienced first hand in Ireland on farms and in family businesses.  The issue came up earlier in the year on the introduction of employment legislation. Those who work at home have been exploited much more than those working <Col N="1785" /> in factories or in offices, and, again, that is something I deplore.</P>
    <P>The seventh suggestion was to encourage the taking up of part-time work as a passport to full-time employment.  In a perfect society, when plenty of jobs are available, such a suggestion would be welcomed, but experience has shown people to be exploited.  In particular I think of the supermarket chains, who are the greatest exploiters in this regard. Employees have worked for major supermarkets for five or 10 years on a part-time basis yet have failed to secure full-time employment.  It has been impossible to come to grips with that problem.  The Minister made an attempt to come to grips with the problem when introducing legislation this year in relation to part-time workers.  I regret to say that some of the predictions I made during that debate have already come to pass in as much as employers have now reduced the threshold.  I should certainly discourage any such suggestion unless there were inbuilt safeguards.  I take it from the Minister that he will take on board some of Deputy Bruton's proposals.</P>
    <P>The eighth point in Deputy Bruton's submission refers to the income tax system.  It is well known that the income tax system is the greatest disincentive for employers to take people on.  Something has to be done about that.  The whole taxation system is so penal that some employers find it difficult to give out a bonus to their workers at Christmas time because £50 or £60 bonus would mean a possible tax commitment at the same level.</P>
    <P>I should comment on one omission.  It may seem that I am putting more emphasis on what Deputy Bruton said than on what the Minister said.  In all fairness, I think the Minister was defending the <i>status quo.</i></P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton was very critical of the Government's performance in the past four years, but for the first two years, from 1987 to 1989, any measures introduced by the former Fianna Fáil Government, as distinct from the present Coalition Government, were made with the support of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Bruton's party.  In that period there was an increase in the number unemployed and an increase in emigration. Were it not for the fact that there was a strategy, then it would not have been possible for the Government to embark on the kind of campaign that they did.  The Government introduced a system of what I would call &ldquo;industrial euthanasia&rdquo;, in which public sector jobs in particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During that period it would not have been possible to introduce job sharing in the public sector were it not for the support given to the previous Government. In the past the public sector has been the catalyst for job creation but from 1987 to 1989 the wholesale shedding of jobs occurred.  I think in particular of Cork, where more than 500 jobs were shed.  There are still jobs under threat in the public sector &mdash; in Irish Steel, Aer Lingus, Telecom Éireann and An Post. In the creation of jobs the first requirement is to ensure the retention of existing jobs.  We have to consolidate our position, hold our ground.  The time has come to say &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  We have to say that we do not want any viability plan for An Post or any further cutbacks in RTE and that we will defend the jobs in Irish Steel.  If we could achieve that then we would have started fighting back.  Unless we have faith in ourselves and in our indigenous industries, there is no way we can whip the unemployment problem.  With our total dependance on multinationals in the past few years we have lost faith in ourselves and some self respect.  We must ensure that no further jobs are sold off by way of redundancy &mdash; in particular, public sector redundancy.  Public sector services have been trimmed to such a degree that the areas of health and local <Col N="1788" /> government in particular cannot cope with the demand.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>In page 10, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1. &mdash;Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1987 and section 7 of the Finance Act, 1989 shall not have effect as respects the year 1991-1992 and subsequent years of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Deputy Noonan, <i>Limerick East).</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We were dealing with amendments from Deputy Noonan and myself concerning the question of mortgage interest relief.  I was explaining the thrust of my party's argument on the basis that, since there appears to be a very unfair proportion of tax paid by the PAYE sector &mdash; and that, preponderantly, since these are the same people who are adversely affected by high interest rates &mdash; it would be appropriate that the total interest relief of 100 per cent would apply to home owners in the category we are addressing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of interest rates has changed in recent times; there was a time when they were used as an instrument to <Col N="1789" /> control inflation but it would appear now that interest rates are used to attempt to stem the outflow of funds from the economy.  Despite the level at which interest rates are pitched with the purpose of doing that, the extent of outflow of capital is still extremely worrying.  The outflows, of course, are made up of a number of things, including repatriation of profits, which is a vast drain on the economy.  Nonetheless, the fact remains that interest rates are exceptionally high; when we were taking this Bill last year we could instance four separate increases of 1 per cent during that year and, give or take variations since then, they remain at that level and are likely to continue to do so.  Our relationship with the German economy, through the monetary system, is likely to ensure that they will stay since the German approach seems to be to tackle their particular problems exclusively on a monetary basis rather than on the basis of any fiscal changes which should be taken on board having regard to their wider responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, people are being unfairly penalised in the home ownership bracket, especially new borrowers. Of course there is the additional matter of the rash of home possessions which is now under way and which has been for some time, by building societies and local authorities through the HFA system.  I am not arguing that 100 per cent mortgage interest relief would prevent the level of home repossessions which, sadly, are going on at the moment, but it would certainly help a great many people who are struggling to make ends meet; it would greatly assist them if the 100 per cent mortgage interest relief was restored.</P>
    <P>I know it can be argued that this is not a very progressive amendment against the background of our general discussion about allowances, reliefs and so on but, in the context of overall lack of reform, we are reduced to this kind of special pleading.  I have attempted, in the subsequent amendment which I had intended to have taken with this as part (a) and part (b) to temper that and to try to introduce a note of progressivity to the <Col N="1790" /> intent behind it, inasmuch as it would be biased in favour of those on lower incomes, but I am happy to support amendment No. 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an identical amendment to that tabled by Deputies Noonan and Rabbitte but, although they are the same, they are printed separately. I have a mortgage on my house so, if this amendment was accepted, it would help to reduce my tax somewhat; perhaps other Members are also in that position.</P>
      <P>Our party very strongly believe in real tax reform, not the kind that is bandied about the House, particularly by the Progressive Democrats.  Be that as it may, we are dealing with a situation where the Finance Bill, as usual, tinkers with the tax system.  The reason I put down this amendment is a recognition of the reality that we are stuck with the tax system we have had for a number of years.  Obvious improvements, such as a system of tax credits, which would grant allowances at the standard rate only would, of course, be of considerable assistance and a form of progressive taxation which would help the medium sized income earners as opposed to the large income earners.</P>
      <P>Mortgage interest relief can, for certain categories of taxpayers, be a bit of a rip-off; there has been a tendency over the last few years to trade up, people are trading up, making large profits on the sale of their homes, moving into bigger homes and getting larger mortgages.  This is recognised and that is why there is an upper limit on mortgage interest relief.  I do not disagree with that &mdash; I do not think anybody would disagree with it, but the effect of reducing the allowance from 100 per cent to 80 per cent across the board is that it hits the poor and relatively poor just as much as it hits the rich; it is a very blunt instrument and it amazes me that mortgage interest relief cannot be looked at in this light.  Let us penalise the people who borrow large sums and who are trading up and give 100 per cent relief to middle and working class people who are struggling to pay off mortgages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan said several times in his contribution, interest rates are <Col N="1791" /> extraordinarily high at the moment and are very hard on people with mortgages. I appreciate that we must try as far as possible to broaden the tax base but the effort in this regard brought in by the Minister some years ago has created tremendous hardship for many middle and working class people struggling to own their homes.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment to relieve the inequity on people in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to remove the restrictions on mortgage interest relief imposed by section 6 of the Finance Act, 1987, and section 7 of the Finance Act, 1989.  If I were to accept the amendment, it would cost the Exchequer £34 million in 1991 and £56 million in a full year.  I do not, therefore, propose to accept the amendment and would like to take this opportunity to outline my reasons for not doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, the modest restriction of mortgage interest relief must be seen in the context of the major progress made in reducing the income tax burden on individuals in recent years.  Looking at budgets over the period from 1988 to 1991 the general exemption limits have been increased from £2,650 to £3,400 for a single person and from £5,300 to £6,800 for a married couple.  In 1989, a child addition was introduced in conjunction with those limits and now stands at £300 for each of the first two children and £500 for the third and each subsequent child: this innovation was aimed specifically at low-income taxpayers with family responsibilities.  The standard rate tax band has been widened by £2,000 for a single person and £4,000 for a married couple &mdash; an increase of 40 per cent.  This contrasts with the maximum restriction in the mortgage interest relief of £400 for a single person and £800 for a married couple.  Substantial steps have also been taken in cutting tax rates; as we are all aware, the standard rate is down from 35 per cent to 29 per cent and the top rate of tax has been cut from 56 per cent to <Col N="1792" /> 52 per cent.  In other words, the past few years have seen very substantial improvements in the three focal points of income tax policy &mdash; exemption limits, tax rates and tax bands.  These reliefs which have been costly and which must be funded from existing Exchequer resources have benefited every taxpayer, and it is against this background that the modest restriction of mortgage interest relief must be viewed.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress was made under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in improving the efficiency and equity of the tax system.  The burden of personal income tax was considerably alleviated and, while the Government's commitment in that programme was to introduce income tax reliefs to the cumulative value of £225 million, in fact the cumulative value of the reliefs introduced by the Government over the life of the programme exceeded £800 million, or more than three times the programme's commitment. The gains from the mortgage interest relief restrictions are being used to pay a small part of the cost to the Exchequer of these major improvements.</P>
    <P>I recognise, of course, that more needs to be done and the Government have undertaken, in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> to make further improvements in income tax, according as budgetary and economic circumstances permit, over the coming three years.  In particular, our aim is to get the standard rate down to 25 per cent by 1993 while moving towards a single higher rate.</P>
    <P>The House will not need reminding that mortgage interest relief is already a very expensive tax relief and is estimated to cost some £223 million in the current tax year in terms of tax foregone.  This represents a very substantial Exchequer subsidy for house purchase.  Restoring the relief to 100 per cent would add £56 million a year to its cost.  No one has indicated to me how this cost should be met.</P>
    <P>The Government are, of course, concerned about those paying mortgages and are striving by their domestic budgetary <Col N="1793" /> and other policies to provide the economic background conducive to maintaining interest rates which are as low as possible.  This is what we have been doing and will continue to do.  A justification put forward at times for removing the mortgage interest restrictions is the upward trend of interest rates.  The House will, no doubt, be aware that the trend in recent months has been downward and the indications are for further decreases in the coming months.  In all the circumstances, I must, as I have said, oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would be inclined to accept what the Minister has said if he could convince us he has any policy on interest rates or real evidence to show that the trend in interest rates is downwards.  It seems we are in a period where interest rates will continue to fluctuate quite a bit but tend to stay high rather than low.  Deputy Rabbitte spoke about the changing role of interest rates in fiscal and monetary management.  I do not know whether he is correct &mdash; I suspect he is not &mdash; but it seems that the tying of most of the currencies in western Europe to the Deutsche Mark has led to an increase in interest rates.  Before the reunification of Germany it was a tenable economic argument on the exchange rate that the market was under-valued but because the other EMS partners would not agree to a revaluation of the Deutsche Mark the Germans had to look at other methods to achieve their economic ends.  I believe it was an instrument of policy in Germany to increase interest rates.  I think they used interest rates to fight inflation in the traditional fashion that Deputy Rabbitte seems to think they have departed from.  There was an added twist to the drama but that is where it ended up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the German Central Bank, led by the renowned gentleman who retired last week, took a deliberate decision to have high interest rates to dampen down demand in other European countries, a demand boosted by the fact that their currencies which were tied to the <Col N="1794" /> Deutsche Mark were probably overvalued right across the board.  We might have been better off if we had let the Germans increase their rates on their own if everybody else decided to keep their rates down.  I am not saying we had much control over this as a small economy, but the price of remaining in tandem 18 months ago was a deliberate decision in Germany to raise interest rates.</P>
    <P>Coincidentally, political events in eastern Europe and in Germany reinforced the trend of high interest rates.  We read quite frequently now in feature articles in the daily newspapers as well as in the commentaries in the economic magazines that the cost of reunification of Germany was higher than anticipated when the arrangements were put in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> And Comrade Pohl as well.  What is happening is that high interest rates are being underpinned by a series of political and economic decisions taken in Germany since reunification.  I agree with Deputy Quinn to some degree because the first decision taken in the election which led to the reunification of Germany was that taxes would not be increased.  If one cannot increase taxes to fund the reconstruction of an underdeveloped part of a country, <Col N="1795" /> given that it is policy to redevelop it, one must look to some other method of funding.  The alternative to raising taxes is always borrowing and to borrow sufficient funds German interest rates have to remain high.  If one is going to fund the reconstruction of what was East Germany using Germany Federal bonds, the interest rate has to be high enough to attract the money.  What started as a result of an exchange rate policy, where the other partners in Europe were to blame rather than the West Germans, was overtaken by events following reunification. This tends to underpin high interest rates.</P>
      <P>Since then there has been a reversal of policy in Germany and the commitments given by the two partners in Government that taxes would not be increased have not been kept.  Taxes have been increased and the major increase in takes has been put forward as a temporary measure but that was probably done too late.  Reunification of the two economies, in particular the reunification of their currencies on a one-to-one basis, has brought about a situation where there is massive unemployment in what was East Germany which will lead inevitably to social tensions.  A combination of an increase in taxes and high interest rates will be required to fund the reconstruction of the former East Germany. After aspiring for freedom on the wrong side of the Wall for years, it is not politically acceptable anywhere in Europe that 20 million Germans should become disillusioned quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price, which I believe will be paid to ensure no disillusionment, will be an old fashioned Keynesian attitude to the former East German economy.  A great many other things will be happening as well but in my view the initial policy will be an injection of investment in what was East Germany, some of which will come from the increased taxes on the German taxpayer but a great deal more will come from borrowings.  The borrowing will be on German paper which I believe will keep interest rates high.  We will be tied in as a surrogate currency for the Deutsche <Col N="1796" /> Mark.  There may not be a huge differential between us but in the heel of the hunt it will need a differential to attract investment in Dublin rather than in Frankfurt.  The only thing that will reverse that policy will be a weakening in the German economy.  If there is a weakening in the German economy to the extent that interest rates here are lower than in Germany because our investment market is more attractive, I suggest that the German economy will have gone into a degree of recession where it will no longer be the engine of Europe and the latter situation will be worse than the first.  While we might have a temporary decrease in interest rates I think the forward situation would be worse.</P>
    <P>We have just listened to a very interesting debate on unemployment.  Unemployment is certainly the number one social and economic issue and it will probably become the number one political issue over the next couple of years.  We all know of the social problems that arise directly from unemployment.  We have a catastrophically high rate of unemployment. It is worth trying to measure the effect of high interest rates on unemployment. The productivity of the Irish workforce is increasing somewhere in the order of 2.5 per cent, but growth rates of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent are not sufficient to increase jobs and are probably sufficient only to maintain existing jobs.  To get the level of growth the Minister and the Government require to crack the jobs problem would be very difficult at the present level of interest rates.  I have put this point to the Minister previously.</P>
    <P>This morning, or perhaps it was the afternoon, the Minister spoke of our inflation rate of 2.7 per cent, let us say 2.75 per cent, but the ordinary overdraft rate is 15.75 per cent so that if you subtract the inflation rate of 2.75 per cent from that you are left with 13 per cent, so 13 per cent is the real interest rate for a great many people now.  Can anyone tell me where you can invest money in Ireland at present to get a return of 13 per cent?  That is the opening position, unless you can get a return of 13 per cent <Col N="1797" /> on the money invested, the value of your investment will have gone down by the following year.  There has to be a direct connection between that kind of investment climate, economic growth and the creation of jobs.  The other alternative, of course, is that one would invest that money somewhere else, preferably in an area where it is lying fairly idle and one is getting a reasonable return.  Risking paying out 13 per cent on borrowed money in order to stand still or the alternative of investing in Government paper, where one gets a return of 10 per cent or 10.5 per cent is not feasible in this investment climate.  The question of interest rates has to be addressed directly.  We know how interest rates affect the living standards of people with very high mortgages.  However, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wonder if the Minister is aware of what is happening in the garage trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if Deputy Noonan would allow me to intervene at this stage.  We have moved from East Germany and the Deputy is now about to attack the problems in relation to garages. Perhaps the Deputy would attack the amendments, of which there are 77 left to be dealt with between now and 10.30 p.m.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I was not the Deputy who drifted into the discussion on interest rates, but once the issue was raised by other Deputies, it was important to talk about it in this context.  I am making the point that this amendment would meet the problems of people paying very high mortgage interest but there are other areas where interest rates are fanning very serious problems.  These problems are cutting right across the economy.  At present there are cars worth <Col N="1798" /> between £1 million and £1.5 million sitting in the forecourts of garages while the garage proprietors are on the verge of being called in by the bank manager and being closed down.  That is what is happening and I am sure the Minister is aware of it.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not exaggerating the position, and I could name names.  Builders are telling me that when they finish the present scheme of 25 to 30 houses they will stop building because they do not know what the future holds.  When the people employed in indigenous activity, when motor mechanics are out of work and people in the building industry are being made redundant and the building industry is winding down again, it is very important to look at measures such as this not only from the point of view of benefit to the mortgage holder but for the impact it might have on the building industry, which is now going into recession.  I talked to a builder last night who told me that this time last year he employed 75 people but that he has only two employed today.  He does not know what the future holds and he will do nothing for the next six months. I am sure Deputy Quinn knows about this as well.</P>
      <P>I am not putting forward this measure solely for relief for the hard pressed mortgage holder paying high mortgage interest but I am coming back to the issue of whether this Government have the initiative any more either on the tax or fiscal side that will actually encourage job creation.  Are we going to proceed until unemployment reaches 300,000 over the next 18 months because as sure as we are here &mdash; Deputy Quinn said it very recently &mdash; that is where it is going to, 300,000 and more?  I do not intend to take up the time of the House but this is a very important issue.</P>

      <P>A lot of play has been made of what would be needed to restore the mortgage interest relief to its former level and I would like to point out a few facts for the benefit of the House. As I have said, the cost of restoring mortgage relief would be £56 million and 325,000 people would benefit by an average of £172 per annum.  We started in 1988 by removing 10 per cent of the mortgage interest relief but the cost of tax relief in the budgets in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991 is £674 million.  The number benefiting was 869,000 at an average benefit of £776.  It is quite clear where the benefit lies.  There is no question about it.  I know that Deputy Garland among others has suggested restoring it in order to relieve hardship.  We have to make up our minds, either we are widening the tax base or we are not.  If we are widening the base let us stick with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, it is not going to be easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it boils down to, we cannot have our loaf and eat it.  We must decide on what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of interest rates, it is well known that the pressure is downward on interest rates in America.  It is quite clear that the message emanating from America and many other countries, including Spain, where the rate came down by 0.75 per cent at the start of this week, is for pressure for reduced interest rates.  However, in Germany there are more tax increases to come in June &mdash; whatever level they are going to be, and I do not think anybody can prejudge that <Col N="1800" /> situation.  Whether we talk about G7 or G24 there is an appreciation that lower interest rates are required to kick start the world economy out of the recession it is in at present.  We are dependent on that whether we like it or not in that we export goods to the value of £2 out of every £3 we produce.  Consequently when there is such a bad recession in the United Kindgom and the US and other countries inevitably it backs up here.</P>
    <P>We have made good progress in the past couple of years both in terms of our competitiveness and interest rates.  We have narrowed the margin between the punt and the Deutsche Mark to 1 per cent from 9 per cent in 1987.  The unit wage cost has benefited quite significantly. It has improved by 18 per cent in common currency terms.  The OECD forecast that of all OECD countries Ireland will have the lowest unit wage cost increases in the business sector in the period 1991-92.   As I have said, we are well positioned to take advantage of the recovery when it comes.  We all know the effect real interest rates have on investment.  However, this is a worldwide factor and we cannot press the button and hope to get something different.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Rabbitte that we are not having outflows from the economy.  For sometime we had outflows when people thought the margin was not sufficient.  This was tested last October or November and the margin is being narrowed all the time towards equality with the Deutsche Mark.  I suspect that in the next 12 or 18 months the margin will be even closer, if not equalised.</P>
    <P>That is the background against which we are talking.  As I said, we have to either widen or narrow the base.  We have to take our pick; we cannot have an each way bet.  Even though the mortgage interest relief was reduced from 100 per cent to 80 per cent, I believe taxpayers have benefited by £776 on average by way of additional tax reliefs.  This is an indication that the taxpayer is winning which, as I see it, is my job.</P>

      <P>The Minister addressed his points about widening the tax base to me in particular.  Obviously this is very good in theory but I put it to the Minister that he is not at all keen on widening the tax base when it comes to the corporate sector &mdash; section 84, the bank levy, section 23, the very low rates of corporation tax and various write-offs for companies.  This is all one way business &mdash; individuals, small traders and professional people are the victims of the racket while large businesses and firms are gaining.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is essentially a rose by another name.  We have already dispensed with the primary arguments in regard to indexation in Deputy Noonan's amendment which basically proposed that the allowances should be increased. <Col N="1803" /> I am not going to take up the time of the House as I am more concerned with other amendments in my name.  The Minister and his officials are well aware of the full implications of the amendments in my name and the amendments in the names of other Deputies, all of which propose to index in varying marginal degrees the extent of the allowances which are provided for.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clearly indicated in the House that faced with the choice of reducing the nominal rate of taxation, the percentage at which the take occurs, or alternatively the allowance threshold at which it impacts, and having regard to the overall constraints on the Government's perception of the amount of money they need to raise by way of taxation, in effect, he has decided to freeze allowances and to start to systematically reduce rates over the next year or so in accordance with the programme.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to confirm that that is a correct and reasonably factual observation of his position &mdash; there will be no movement on allowances. Effectively what this country has on option this year through the Coalition Government is a factual reduction in the percentage rates at which taxation will impact and a freezing of the allowance threshold level at which they will occur or some other variation which will have the same revenue effect, and there is no possibility of both.  If, having regard to his extensive reply to Deputy Noonan's contributions on section 1, that is the Minister's position, I should like him to clarify it for the record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendments Nos. 9 and 12 deal with exemption limits.  While I welcome the small increase in exemption limits given by the Government this year, this is probably the most important way we can give recognition to the ridiculous situation where people on small incomes have to pay income tax.  The Minister is proposing an exemption limit of £3,400 for a single person, about £64 or £65 per week.  This is a very small <Col N="1804" /> amount and anything over this amount will be taxed.</P>
      <P>Like the Deputy Quinn I believe the first priority of the Government should be to take these people out of the tax net. The same applies to married couples who earn up to £6,800 a year.  It probably costs more to collect these small amounts of PAYE than is actually taken from such people.  These people also have to pay PRSI contributions.  The Minister should be generous to them.  Deputy Bryne wants to increase the limits even further. Perhaps he is going a little too far while Deputy Quinn is not going far enough.  My figures of £4,000 and £8,000 seem to be right, and perhaps the Minister can take them on board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to argue in favour of Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 8 calling for the limit of £6,800 to be substituted by £10,000.  I am in favour of amendment No. 11 too which calls for the substitution of £3,400 with £5,000.  Everybody is now agreed that rising tides do not raise all boats.  It is very sad that people such as the elderly, old age pensioners, widows and certain categories of retired workers with small incomes by way of pension from the companies they worked for and who are also drawing old age pensions are taxed when one considers the amount of tax evasion that takes place here and when one looks at the £500 million debacle concerning Goodman.  It is difficult to reconcile the fact that these people who worked hard all their lives and have earned a miserable pension from the companies for whom they worked are taxed while others are evading their tax.  Under no circumstances should couples in receipt of £10,000 a year be considered to be wealthy.  They should not be taxed.  Various reports have shown that many of the disadvantaged poor in our society are actually paying tax.  Like previous speakers I appeal to <Col N="1805" /> the Minister, to recognise that people on the poverty line are being forced into the tax net, and to take our amendments on board.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn proposes to increase the limits as set out in the Bill, by £700 for married couples and by £350 for single and widowed persons, the cost of which is £14.6 million in 1991 and £24.3 million in a full year and would exempt some 29,600 persons from tax liability.</P>

      <P>In 1988 the limit for single and widowed persons was £2,750. It is now £3,400, an increase of 24 per cent.  I would love to make it 124 per cent but balances have to be struck.  The limit for a married couple with no children was £5,500 in 1988 and is now £6,800, an increase of £1,300.  The limit for married couples with three children has been increased from £5,500 to £7,900, an increase of £2,400 or 44 per cent.  Those are areas where there are real poverty. A married couple with four children had the limit increased from £5,500 to £8,400, an increase of £2,900 or 53 per cent. The limit for a married couple with five children was increased from £5,500 to £8,900, an increase of £3,400 or 62 per cent and the limit for a married couple with six children was increased from £5,500 to £9,400, an increase of £3,900 or 71 per cent.  There stands my record in this area.  I would like to do more and will continue to do more but we have to put the record straight.  Certain people seem to think that nothing was done in this area.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill already provides for generous increases in the general exemption limits of £300 in the case of married couples and £150 in the case of single and widowed persons.</P>
      <P>In addition, in recognition of the difficulties faced by low income families, the special addition of £300 per dependent child is being increased for each third and subsequent child to £500 per child.  This child element, and especially the increase for each third and subsequent child, is intended to target relief at a group which has been identified as particularly in need of State support &mdash; low income married couples with large families &mdash; and, together with the increases in the basic exemption limits, will go a long way towards alleviating the tax burden on such low income families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases provided by section 1 <Col N="1807" /> and the associated marginal relief will cost the Exchequer £8.6 million in 1991 and £14.3 million in a full year and will exempt 17,900 persons &mdash; with 22,500 children &mdash; from liability to income tax. A further 26,300 taxpayers &mdash; with 35,500 children &mdash; will have reduced liability because of the operation of marginal relief as a consequence of the increases in the exemption limit and the reduction in the marginal relief rate.</P>
    <P>The increases in the exemption limits provided for in section I are the most generous that can be afforded at this time especially as other significant reliefs, i.e. the reduction in both the standard and top rates of tax, the increases in the standard rate band &mdash; section 2 &mdash; and the personal allowances &mdash; section 3 &mdash; and the renewal of the PRSI allowance &mdash; section 9 &mdash; costing some £106.9 million in 1991 and £176.3 million in a full year, are provided for in the Bill.  Accordingly, the amendments must be opposed.</P>
    <P>Our tax policy is clear cut.  We are not, under any circumstances, freezing all allowances and just going after rates on their own.  We are doing a combination of other things as circumstances permit.</P>

      <P>I might have been slightly out of order interrupting the Minister and for that I apologise but it struck me when he was speaking that since self-assessment was brought in a substantial amount of evasion has been taking place particularly by the self-employed.  Added to that, the Combat Poverty Agency held a conference only yesterday which highlighted the stark reality of Irish life today, that one in five of our population are living on or below the poverty line and many people in low paid employment are equally trapped.  When the ESRI carried out a survey in 1987 they found that 66 per cent of those living in poverty and paying tax would move above the poverty line if their tax burdens were removed. There are enough bodies out there among the caring agencies, not least of which is the Combat Poverty Agency, who argue that we should remove those on lower incomes from the tax net.  On that basis <Col N="1808" /> we were seeking to increase the exemption limits substantially.  Of course we are conscious it costs money.  There was no doubt in our minds that it was in the full knowledge of that that we called not just glibly but sincerely for an increase in the exemption limits.  A two-tier society seems to be developing.  The rising economic fortunes Fianna Fáil Ministers speak about so proudly are fine in that people benefit from them, but the sad reality is that huge and ever-increasing numbers are not benefiting.  The Minister for Labour at the combat poverty conference yesterday at least recognised that the rising tide is not lifting all boats.  We are developing more and more rapidly into a very destructive, divisive, two-tier structured society.  The degree of resentment is understandable when, for example, old age pensioners are forced into the tax net with miserable small company pensions coupled with social insurance pensions.  I leave that point for the Minister to bear in mind.</P>

I know there are problems and we are moving along at the best pace possible.  When we talk about increases ranging from 24 per cent to 71 per cent in a period when the cost of living rose by 10 per cent that indicates the Government's record in tackling this problem which was highlighted by the ESRI report some three years ago.</P>

      <P>In page 10, paragraph (a), between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted Deputy Gay Mitchell's amendment to give the married exemption limits to widowed and single parents.  The House will be aware that there is already provision in the income tax code for the position of widowed and single parents in that widowed and single parent allowances bring their basic allowances up to the same level as those of a married couple. In addition widowed and single parents who are taxpayers will have benefited from the general income tax reliefs introduced in recent years, including increases in the personal allowances, reduction of the standard rate to 29 per cent and extension of the standard band by £2,000 over recent years.</P>
      <P>The fact that widowed and single parents have personal allowances equivalent to the married personal allowances means their basic allowances significantly exceed the single exemption limit.  If they qualify for PAYE and PRSI allowances, as is often the case, their allowances would substantially exceed the single limit.</P>
      <P>I would not be in favour of allowing such taxpayers the married exemption limits.  The reason married couples receive the double exemption limit is quite simple; it is because there are two adults to support.  This is not the case with widowed and single parents where there is only one adult to support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, as Deputies will be aware, in recent years I introduced a child addition in conjunction with the exemption limits.  The Deputy's amendment would mean that this would apply in conjunction with the married limits for <Col N="1810" /> widowed and single parents.  This would mean double recognition of children for such taxpayers, once in being granted the married exemption limits and again in benefiting from the child addition.  This would be in sharp contrast to the position of married couples who do not generally receive recognition for their children in the tax code but where they do, by means of the child addition, they receive such recognition only once.  Accordingly, if the double limits were granted to widowed and single parents in conjunction with the child addition we would have a situation where one household was getting the same exemption as another despite having just one adult fewer.</P>
    <P>I should also mention the cost of implementing this amendment would be over £3 million a year.  In view of all these factors I could not agree to accept Deputy Mitchell's amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In page 12, lines 2 and 3, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) As regards 1991-92 and subsequent years of assessment, relief in respect of children shall be allowed at £300 per child.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to re-introduce child income tax allowance at £300 per child.  I raised this matter last year during the course of the Finance Bill.  I did not expect that the Minister would pay attention to it because his sums and figures were done, but I had hoped he would take it on board in 1991.  He has not done so and I dare say I will be here this time next year proposing the same amendment.  Since then one could make a case for increasing this amount to £500. The reason I selected £300 was that this is the exemption limits the Minister introduced in the 1990 Finance Act.  He clearly indicated that for a low-income married couple with children the exemption limit was not adequate and should, therefore, be increased by £300 per child.  I would welcome that.  In this year's Finance Bill he has increased that amount to £500 per child.  In spite of that he has still not reintroduced children's allowance for the average taxpayer.</P>
      <P>There are many taxpayers who are just over the exemption limit and, furthermore, are just over the limit where marginal relief would apply.  This is a new kind of poverty trap.  When a person with four or five children gets beyond the exemption limit and the marginal relief they are in trouble because they are no longer in receipt of the child allowance. It can be argued that parents receive child benefit, and this is very good but it is by no means sufficiently high.  Had the Minister's colleague in the Department of Social Welfare been more generous, this amendment might not be necessary. The fact is that the level of child benefit is not adequate, hence we must recognise the real financial burden on parents with children; that is something not reflected in the income tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind Members of the House <Col N="1812" /> that the child allowance used to extend to children at third level provided they were receiving full-time education. Already today Deputy Noonan, who tabled amendment No. 2, endeavoured to obtain some relief for parents who had children at third level colleges.  While I had some reservations about that amendment, I felt it was on the right lines in the sense that it was a recognition of the extra costs to be met by people with children. I do not suppose this amendment will get support from anyone else in the House because no one else has tabled an amendment in that respect, but perhaps there will be some contribution from the Opposition Deputies on that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have a lot of sympathy with Deputy Garland's arguments.  I would approach it from a different perspective and it is this: the whole poverty trap is preventing certain people from ever taking part in the workforce. If a man with, say, four children is in receipt of unemployment assistance, he will get child dependant allowance for the four children and the children's allowance will be paid to his wife.  What was normally called children's allowance will be paid to the family, and through the social welfare code an allowance in respect of each child will also be paid.  If the same man returns to work he will get child benefit but there is no longer a child tax relief.  I am aware that that relief was abolished when we were in Government but that particular consequence was not foreseen.  There is no doubt that it was one of the key factors in magnifying the effect of the poverty trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much in sympathy with removing a clause which in effect means that a married man with four children cannot go back to work unless he gets a wage of about £230 per week, because otherwise his finances will work out at about the same when everything is included.  That has been confirmed by a question from the leader of the Labour Party and by statements in the House by the Minister for Labour, Deputy B. Ahern.  There is no longer any argument about the nature of the problem.  Some <Col N="1813" /> of us may say the problem is more severe for a person in receipt of £180, others would argue that the income is higher, and there would be a debate about what should be a factor in relation to deductions. Much of the difficulty arises directly from the fact that there is a double benefit in respect of children of the unemployed.  That is fair enough, they need it, but it is paid in two ways. When the same person returns to work, only the child benefit is paid and there is no allowance under the tax code.  If the person concerned is single there is no problem; if the person is married with one child, the problem is small, but when it comes to a family of four children in receipt of benefit there is a real aggravation of the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>To try to give extra income to needy families through the tax code &mdash; unless tax credits are provided &mdash; means that the person at the higher marginal rate is getting more than the person at the lower marginal rate.  In other words, a £100 worth of children's allowance to somebody paying tax at the rate of 53 per cent is worth £53, whereas to somebody paying tax at the standard rate it is worth only £29.  That is regressive because the person who has a much higher income receives twice as much.  That is the problem we cannot overcome.  When we abolished that allowance in Government we use all that money to increase child benefit. Because child benefit can be targeted, the mother receives the same allowance in respect of each child, whereas if the same money is used through the tax system it is skewed towards the better off because the allowance is applied at the marginal rate.  I do not have a solution to the original problem I outlined, the poverty trap, which is so evident in the system.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on it.  It seems to me that consideration must be given to the possibility of one integrated child allowance in respect of children whose parents work or whose parents are unemployed.  While our solution was intended as a more equitable system, it produced this unforeseen result of a poverty trap which we had not identified when we made the <Col N="1814" /> decision.  If we accepted the Deputy's amendment we would return to the old problem of the tax allowance going to the better off families rather than to the average or poorer families.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a further study on the possibility of having one integrated child allowance, whether it is under the social welfare code, the child benefit scheme, under the tax allowance or whether it would follow from progressively increasing the exemption limits which the Minister introduced in respect of children two years ago.  I would like the Minister's views on it.  There is room for a further study on it and action in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Woods, is studying the area the Deputy has talked about here.  This amendment seeks to reintroduce the child tax allowance of £300 in respect of each child which was withdrawn in the 1986-87 period with the introduction of the new social welfare child benefit to which Deputy Noonan referred.  In accordance with the Government's decision to consolidate secondary tax allowances with social welfare payments, it was felt, because of the different rates of tax, that the child tax allowance applied unequally and child benefit got over the problem.  This amendment must be viewed against the background of the progress that has been made in introducing substantial income tax reliefs in recent years, progress which has significantly benfited all taxpayers, including those with families.  This year's budget provided for an increase in the social welfare child benefit of £7.10 for the fourth and subsequent child, bringing the new rate up to £22.90 per month.  The increase applies from October this year. For each of the first three children the monthly rate is £15.80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment before us, if accepted, would mean that people paying the standard rate of tax would get less than those on the higher rates, which is a problem already referred to.  This is not the best way to distribute scarce resources.  It will not get to the people who need it most. <Col N="1815" /> Again this year, I have targeted the lower rate taxpayers with children for relief under the tax code and that is why I moved along that road a couple of years ago &mdash; to try to target money where it is needed, to the people on lower incomes with large families.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Garland would cost £42 million in 1991 and £70 million in a full year.  In the light of the general reliefs in this year's budget and the particular emphasis that this and previous years, budgets have placed on helping lower paid families, I cannot accept the amendment. It would not be the right way to target the money.  I have taken on board some of the comments of Deputy Noonan.  We have removed quite a few of the problems in that area but there is still a margin to be got at.  We will continue to work towards eliminating that margin.</P>

Will the Minister comment briefly on whether he is prepared to give serious consideration between now and the next budget to looking at the question of a system of tax credits?  This would possibly satisfy Deputy Noonan.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that, as my amendment stands, it will benefit higher rate taxpayers. That is not my intention, but all allowances at the moment benefit higher rate taxpayers unduly, whereas a system of tax credits would not do so.</P>

    <P Just="Right">'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to write in over a three year period the full extent of what the Labour Party would like to see implemented by way of a range of tax allowances and tax rates.  The scheduled Table A (1991-92) speaks for itself and I have nothing further to add in view of the extended discussion we had on the whole question of income tax allowances today.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to put in place now an income tax rate structure that would apply for the years 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94 and subsequent years of assessment. While the rate of tax proposed are constant, at 29, 48 and 52 per cent, the scheme envisages a widening of the standard rate tax band in each year and also a broadening of the 48 per cent tax band <Col N="1818" /> for the years 1992-93 and 1993-94 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>For 1991-92 the amendment proposes to widen the standard rate band beyond what is proposed in the Bill from £6,700 to £7,500, an increase of £800 for single and widowed persons, and from £13,400 to £15,000, an increase of £1,600 for married couples.</P>
      <P>For 1992-93 the amendment proposed to widen the standard rate band beyond what is proposed in the Bill from £6,700 to £8,750, an increase of £2,050 for single and widowed persons, and from £13,400 to £17,500, an increase of £4,100 for married couples and to increase the 48 per cent rate band from £3,100 to £3,750 an increase of £650 for single and widowed persons, and from £6,200 to £7,500, and increase of £1,300, for married couples.</P>
      <P>For 1993-94 and subsequent years of assessment the amendment proposes to widen the standard rate band, beyond what is proposed in the Bill from £6,700 to £10,000, an increase of £3,300, for single and widowed persons, from £13,400 to £20,000, an increase of £6,000 for married couples; and to increase the 48 per cent rate band, from £3,100 to £4,600, an increase of £1,500 for single and widowed persons, and from £6,200 to £9,200, an increase of £3,000 for married couples.</P>
      <P>The cost of the proposed changes to the Bill in 1991-92 terms is estimated at £43.9 million in the first year and £73.1 million in a full year in respect of the 1991-92 proposals; £57.1 million in the first year and £95.2 million in a full year for the 1991-93 proposals, and £43.0 million in the first year and £71.7 million in a full year in the case of the 1993-94 proposals.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, the proposed changes will cost £250 million over the three year period provided for in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures already incorporated in the Bill propose that the standard rate of tax be reduced from 30 per cent to 29 per cent and that the band of income chargeable at that rate be widened from £6,500 to £6,700 for single and widowed persons and from £13,000 to £13,400 for married couples.  In addition, the top rate <Col N="1819" /> of tax is being reduced from 53 per cent to 52 per cent.  These changes are estimated to cost £57.3 million in 1991 and £95.5 million in a full year.  About 770,000 taxpayers will benefit from these changes.  Moreover, the cost of all the main income tax changes provided for in the Bill is estimated at £183.9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Government are committed in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress to further reduce the standard rate to 25 per cent by 1993 and to move towards a single higher rate.  These and other commitments to income tax improvements over the next three years contained in the programme will cost up to £400 million in a full year.  The measures contained in this year's Bill represent a significant first step in the process of implementing the programme.  The steps whereby the programme's undertaking is achieved and the bands of income to which the reduced rates are to apply will, of course, have to be determined in the context of the budgetary conditions that will prevail in the coming years.  It would be inappropriate that we should be attempting to map out the income tax structure on the basis proposed in the amendment at this stage.  There must be sufficient room for manoeuvre in the framing of future budgets, room which would be severely curtailed by the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    <P>The changes in the rate structure already provided for in the Bill are substantial and are the maximum that can be afforded this year.  In all the circumstances, I must oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was curious to hear the Minister's response to a three year proposal on tax.  Surely the intellectual validity of that approach is written in tablets of stone by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress?</i>  If it is unacceptable to so do in legislation for which the signatories are directly accountable to the public, it is no less unacceptable for the <i>Programme for Economic and Social <Col N="1820" /> Progress</i> to so do and then bring it to the House.  There is a certain disingenuity in the Minister's response.  Why is it wrong to have a three year planned programme if the explicit commitment from the Government, the explicit commitment from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> and the repeated assertions of Government Ministers &mdash; particularly the Minister himself and the Taoiseach &mdash; is to meet in a commitment over a period of three years?  Why can we not go to the next stage now and plan? Nothing in amendment No. 38 prevents the Minister, in the event of some unforeseen circumstance arising in the next year, from coming in with an amendment next year, just as such a provision exists within the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> itself.  The small print of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides that everything is conditional upon the overall movement in economic growth being maintained.</P>
      <P>I shall not go into the Minister's specific arguments.  I thank the Minister for his contribution and his officials &mdash; the staff of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance &mdash; for their co-operation in enabling Members to do our own costing.  That helps the quality of intellectual honesty and debate &mdash; in that order &mdash; in the House, and we are all, as citizens, &mdash; the beneficiaries of that.  I thank the Minister for the costings.  Why is it acceptable to have in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and elsewhere a three year programme but not acceptable as a table set out in section 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is very simple.  Deputy Quinn must know that our commitment to the rates is enshrined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  He has chosen a different way to distribute the money that is in it.  Basically, we are talking about different choices and different priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it, that if the rates were strictly in alignment with what is written down in the <i>Programme for <Col N="1821" /> Economic and Social Progress</i> the Minister would accept such an amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is always a condition in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and everywhere else about budgetary circumstances permitting such things to happen.  In the first programme, a commitment was made for only £225 million but we delivered about £800 million.  The first year of the present programme is a more difficult year, but who is to say that 1992 or 1993 will not be better?  We would all like to do better, but we are all clear about what the commitments in the programme are.  Those are our objectives, that is Government policy, and we strive to achieve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows the position of the Labour Party on the idea of programmes.  The tide will not always be in for whoever occupies the hot seat at present occupied by the Minister.  Would the Minister not agree that in order to give some sense of validity and underpinning, the commitments have to be underwritten in the House, and not behind closed doors in the winter palace across the way?  Would he also agree that they have to be underwritten by people who are themselves accountable to the electorate to provide for the circumstance of a failure, irrespective of the table of numbers?  I am quite prepared to accept that properly speaking from the Minister's point of view the programme commits itself to a different schedule of figures.</P>
      <P>At 9.55 p.m. on this Tuesday night I want to record clearly the Minister's formal political reluctance to write into legislation something that he and his colleagues have frequently trumpeted about when talking about the programme.  The Minister should say whether it is a promise or a commitment.  If it is a promise, the Minister can make that promise outside the House; if it is a commitment, it should be made law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know what the programme is; it is the coming together of a set of objectives and programmes.  We <Col N="1822" /> all know it is subject to the economic circumstances permitting at the time.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments that have already been expressed.  The tables produced in our amendment head in the same general direction, but there is a substantial difference.  The Workers' Party really do believe that the higher earning brackets should have the higher rates of taxation, substantially higher than those already listed.  For example, in an attempt to alleviate the tax burden that has fallen on the groups at the lower end of the income scale, our figures propose a 29 per cent rate of tax from the first £7,550.</P>

      <P>The people had decided that there should be a prohibition on divorce; I do not think that that prohibition will last for very much longer if the present Coalition Government have the wherewithal to recognise the thinking of the people.  I consider it to be an inevitability that within a relatively short period of time the State will recognise that marriages are not staying the course for large numbers of people and that it will eventually regularise the dissolution of marriage.</P>
      <P>Not so long ago the Minister for Social Welfare introduced a regulation in social welfare legislation that gave recognition to cohabiting couples as being the spouse of one another.  The decision was progressive although I think it was intended to cut the amount of benefit which cohabiting couples were receiving. However, now that it is on record that a Minister recognises cohabiting couples as spouses of one another, it should mean that cohabiting couples should be recognised as being married.  The amendment says that for the purpose of income assessment married persons shall mean (a) a man and women who are married to each other, or (b) a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabiting as man and wife.  FLAC might also have something to say in this regard.</P>
      <P>In regard to social welfare payments or benefits there is no point in recognising a relationship in relation to cohabiting where the State recognises them as a spouse of one another and reduces their welfare accordingly but, for tax purposes, it takes a diametrically and opposing position. I will be fascinated to hear the Minister's decision on this amendment; I should like to think he would see merit in supporting it.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The case in this regard was made very strongly last year and this year.  If cohabiting couples are discriminated against in the social welfare code, then they should be on the other code and get the allowances, which would be fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to treat cohabiting couples on the same basis as married couples for tax purposes.  As the Deputy will be aware, in making any changes to the income tax code, there is a necessity to adhere to the precepts of the Constitution in framing such changes.  The Constitution binds the State to safeguard the institution of marriage &mdash; a requirement which the court found to be applicable in tax law in the case of Murphy v. Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to introduce a provision to allow for the assimilation of treatment under the Income Tax Acts to parties outside the legal marriage contract, it could face similar constitutional difficulties. In these circumstances it would not be desirable to make any special provision in the Income Tax Acts in respect of voluntary arrangements such as those identified in the amendment.  Provisions regarding the status of parties to a non-marital relationship should be contained in the general law relating to marriage <Col N="1826" /> which would then be reflected in relevant income tax legislation.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, a White Paper on Marital Breakdown is currently under preparation by the Department of Justice.  In these circumstances, it would be preferable to await the report before making any change in the tax code which, as I have said, reflects the general law relating to marriage.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Byrne's point about social welfare, I noted what has been said about the treatment in this regard of cohabiting couples.  However, the treatment is aimed at ensuring that in the social welfare code cohabiting couples are not treated better than married couples.  There is no necessary connection between that treatment and the income tax treatment of cohabiting couples. In the income tax code married treatment is confined to married couples. This treatment reflects the general law in relation to marriage and I do not have any plans to change it.</P>
    <P>It is not the function of income tax law to move ahead of general marriage law. Provisions regarding the status of parties to a non-marital relationship should, if considered desirable, be contained in the general law relating to marriage which would then be reflected in relevant tax legislation.  We await the publication of the White Paper and we will take the debate from there.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Government have twisted and turned in regard to this hot potato given the constitutional ban on divorce.  Many marriages have irretrievably broken down, through no fault of the people concerned but the State does not afford them civil, legal divorce so that they may rebuild their lives and relationships with other partners.  The Minister said he cannot treat cohabiting people more favourably because of the constitutional safeguard of the institution of marriage.  He also said he can only give tax entitlements to people who are legally married.  I wish that this matter could be challenged by an organisation like FLAC because there is hypocrisy in relation to <Col N="1827" /> those trying to rebuild their lives in second relationships.</P>
      <P>Nothing in the Finance Bill recognises their position, not even on the same basis as they have been recognised as cohabiting spouses by the Department of Social Welfare.  The bare minimum from the Government in this regard would be to recognise, for tax purposes, that they are, to all intents and purposes, married. Their treatment is mean, cruel and petty and the Minister is hiding behind the Constitution which was not intended to be interpreted to discriminate against cohabiting couples.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a personal interest in this matter because I am in a second legal marriage which is not recognised in the State.  In relation to the points which the Minister made about tax, I do not need to remind him of the famous &mdash; or infamous &mdash; Murphy decision, depending on which side of the Revenue collection point of view you are.  I caution him &mdash; perhaps the Minister may wish to come back on Report Stage &mdash; in relation to receiving legal advice.  Has he sought legal advice, from a general point of view, on whether the principles enunciated in the adjudication on the Murphy case <i>vis-à-vis</i> married people living together, seeking the same treatment as two single people living together or separately, might have for the purposes of income tax?  If two people on social welfare took a case in regard to benefits to which they were legally entitled, as distinct from an allowance for which there was an element of insurance contribution, it might result in a judgment not dissimilar to that of the Murphy judgment.  If the Minister got that advice and then did his calculations, he might find it would be much cheaper to concede some points here than to reverse the attempts at reform which the Minister for Social Welfare made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a complex area and nobody has a simple solution.  There are genuine constitutional constraints, this House can propose changes in the Constitution but the electorate have the final say.  As a <Col N="1828" /> democrat I accept that without reservation although I may not like it.  I understand the constraints but I should like to know if the arguments which the Minister put forward take into account the logic of the conclusions of the Murphy case.  If they do not &mdash; I am not a lawyer &mdash; it is possible that the validity of the recent changes made by the Minister for Social Welfare in that respect for some, but not all, social welfare cases could be invalidated.  From an overall Revenue point of view, that might be far more expensive.</P>

      <P>Between now and Report Stage I will look at the points raised by Deputy Quinn.  I do not see any immediate way out.  I am not a lawyer either and I do not propose to go into each Article in the Constitution and how it impacts on this area.  I am glad that Deputy Quinn, as a democrat, accepts the position.  Deputy Byrne does not seem to accept that that is the position. The people have voted on the matter. Like the Deputy, I am well aware of the problems facing people whose marriages have broken down irretrievably but he will not gain anything by pointing the finger at me as if I was a free agent to make changes just because somebody makes a case.  I am not a free agent. Deputy Quinn has been quite open and fair, in saying that this matter affects him.  That is no reason it should not be changed, if it is safe to do so.  The Government will publish a White Paper later this year which will address this problem but, at the end of the day, it is the people of the country, not me or anyone else, who will decide whether the constitutional ban should be removed.  Like everybody else, I only have a role to play.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the part of the Minister's response I heard.  I am not sure I can understand the reason the State can treat a couple in one fashion for social welfare purposes and in a different fashion for taxation purposes. Clearly, the Exchequer saves money in the social welfare area by treating them in one way but when one puts a similar proposition in respect of income tax apparently a different set of rules apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot readily see a constitutional obstacle or impediment in the way of the Minister taking on board the spirit of the resolution.  Surely, it ought to be possible to frame an amendment which is perfectly consistent with the aspiration in the Constitution to protect the family.  We are talking here about common law marriages, about fixed and stable relationships between two adults and I cannot for the life of me see how enshrining the amendment in the Finance Bill, 1991 would run counter to the aspiration in the Constitution to protect the family.  We are not asking the House to approve an amendment that would be enshrined in the Constitution or that would be the subject of a referendum to change the Constitution.  We are merely seeking to highlight the factual position.  Having regard to the precedent referred to by Deputy Quinn, and the situation outlined by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, I beg the Minister's indulgence and patience and ask him to explain again why he considers there is a constitutional impediment in the way of him accepting the fiscal change proposed here.  I cannot readily see it.  We are perfectly free to make this change and it is consistent with the aspiration to protect <Col N="1830" /> the family.  I do not see any conflict because that is precisely what we are doing here.  Two adults, in the circumstances envisaged by the amendment, are just as concerned to protect their family as somebody in a relationship which is acknowledged under the laws of the State.</P>

      <P>The Constitution also sets out to protect the family.  I cannot see how we would undermine the institution of marriage if we were to permit, for tax computation purposes, what is envisaged in the amendment.  Whatever objections there may be to taking the spirit of the amendment on board I cannot accept that there is a constitutional argument that we would undermine marriage if cohabiting couples were treated as if they were married; in other words, that there would be a rush of unofficial liaisons throughout the country for tax purposes.  This is nonsense. There is no tax advantage to be gained in leaving one's spouse or in being thrown out by one's spouse.  That simply does not add up.  At best, one would be no worse off than when one was in a relationship recognised by both the Constitution and the laws of the State.  How it could be considered to be an inducement to undermine the concept of marriage is beyond me.  I honestly think the Minister is trying it on to reject it purely on the basis of a constitutional argument.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between the Table and line 31, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1832" />&ldquo;(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Tax Acts, Part II of the Table to section 2 of the Finance Act, 1984, (inserted by this section), shall apply to persons with dependants who are widows, widowers or single parents.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to have dependants who are widows, widowers or single parents included.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to extend the double rate bands which apply to married persons to single and widowed parents.</P>
      <P>The basic problems which give rise to requests to extend double rate bands to lone parents are the high rates of direct taxation and the low levels of income at which the higher tax rates apply.  If the vast bulk of taxpayers paid tax at the standard rate only, the distinction between the double rate bands and the single rate bands would become largely irrelevant.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's objective as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to further reduce the standard rate of income tax to 25 per cent by 1993 and to implement further movement towards a single higher rate of tax.  This year progress has been made towards achieving that objective.</P>
      <P>General reductions in the rates benefit all taxpayers and reduce the disincentive effects of high tax rates.  This, undoubtedly, is the correct way forward.  In contrast, providing special rate structures for selected groups no matter how deserving, serves only to impede the progress towards lower tax rates and, therefore, runs counter to Government policy. Attainment of the Government's objectives in the taxation field will lead to the elimination of most of the anomalies of concern to Deputies and will result in a better and more acceptable tax system for all taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of extending the double rate bands to one-parent families would be about £4 million in 1991 and £6.5 million in a full year.  If the married entitlement <Col N="1833" /> to mortgage interest and life assurance relief were also extended to single parent families, as should logically be the case, costs would be even greater.</P>
    <P>The income tax code already provides some help for widowed and single parents.  Widowed persons have a widowed personal allowance which stands at £3,600 compared with the single person's allowance of £2,100.  Both widowed and single parents benefit from lone parent allowances which, combined with their basic personal allowance, give such parents effectively the same personal allowance as a married couple, that is, £4,200.  While the Government appreciate that lone parents may have particular difficulties, there are very serious practical objections to giving the double rate bands to them.</P>
    <P>Double rate bands are given to married couples because there are two adults to support.  This is not the position with lone parents whose present tax treatment falls between that of a single person and a married couple &mdash; such treatment is not unreasonable given that there is only one adult to support.  Double rate bands would be of value only to lone parents taxed at the higher rates, at present, about 30 per cent of them are on the higher rates.  Any concession would, therefore, be one for the better off lone parents.  If a concession was made for lone parents because they have children there would be immediate calls for a concession for such parents with lower incomes who could not benefit from a doubling of the bands and also from married couples with children.  As a concession would have already been made for higher rate lone parents, such calls would be virtually impossible to resist.</P>
    <P>However, the root of the problem is, I have to repeat, the burdensome nature of our income tax structure which we are committed to improving in coming years. Consequently, I will be opposing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties with taxation is that the entire system is in need of consolidation.  I do not think there has been a tax consolidation Act <Col N="1834" /> since 1967 and, consequently, we have to deal with reform on a piecemeal basis, such as the amendment in my name which relates to the position of widows, widowers or single parent families.  What strikes one immediately about the Minister's response is the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of his reply when one contrasts it with the debate we have just had about the family and marriage and two adults cohabiting. When it is convenient, we get the very opposite logic to the response to the circumstances envisaged in my amendment, that of a widow, widower or single parents and their dependants.</P>
      <P>The constitutional aspirations and concerns for the family and for the institution of marriage can be turned on their head when presented with another fact of Irish life, the many single parents striving in very difficult circumstances to make ends meet.  The Minister referred to some minimal improvements that have been made, they are precisely that, minimal, and the difference he adverted to in the case of widows is virtually negligible.  The Minister would agree that the difference is minimal.  It would seem to me that somebody who finds herself in a position of being a lone parent and, predominantly, single parents tend to be women &mdash; finds it a great burden and arguably there is a greater burden on her than on the conventional family where there are two adults.  The demands made on the single parent, usually a woman, who is forced to go out to work and does go out to work because she does not want any hand-outs from the State, are enormous and it would be fair that the double benefits would be given to her, as envisaged by this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that the Minister would have addressed this in the debate last year.  It would be a progressive move. It would be an incentive to keep people at work who find themselves in this category. From time to time the extreme right-wing fringe of Irish politics rant and rave that young girls become pregnant merely to benefit from the State allowance and live on the State and it is suspected that they cohabit.  In this <Col N="1835" /> amendment we are dealing with a category of single parents who for whatever reason are in the workforce and want to stay in the workforce and who have dependants to raise and we should give them assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat that double rate bands are provided to support two adults.  In this situation we are talking about one adult, and only 30 per cent of this group of widows, widowers and lone parents are in the high income group and only they would benefit from this amendment.  I do not think that is what Deputy Rabbitte wished to do when pushing the case of this group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I would like to especially thank you for allowing me to raise this matter this evening. While I would like to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, for coming in to reply to me and high as I hold the Minister of State in esteem, I have to express my deep disappointment that the Minister for Health is not here to deal with a very important health issue.</P>
      <P>This matter is a very difficult one to have to raise, involving as it does an entire family and especially the distressing experience of one wife committed involuntarily to a medical home on the initiation of her husband and on the order of two doctors.  I have her agreement to raise this matter here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This happened exactly one week ago. At 5 p.m. on 14 May an ambulance, a squad car, two doctors and this woman's <Col N="1841" /> husband arrived at her home with a temporary committal order.  No medical examination was done and no explanation was given to either the woman or her 74 year old mother who was there and who tried to oppose her being taken away.  Despite strong appeals from women neighbours, at 6.30 p.m. she was forced into the ambulance with a bangharda and taken to St. Patrick's Hospital.  There her clothes and possessions were taken away and she was locked in a room and allowed no telephone calls or visitors.  She spent two nights locked up and was seen by a doctor on 16 May.  He said he found the committal order inappropriate and told her she could leave.</P>
    <P>The woman was released to her brother and is now in hiding afraid that she will be the subject of another committal order, because this woman knows that her mother-in-law was committed involuntarily to a mental hospital five years ago.</P>
    <P>This was a strained and difficult marriage. On 7 May one week before her committal, the woman got a protection order in the District Court for a barring order hearing on 7 June next.  A copy of this barring order was in file in Rathcoole Garda Station and it was from here that a squad car and two gardaí came to escort her to St. Patrick's.  It apparently was ignored.  The implications of that protection order were not considered at all, even by the main architects of her illegal detention.</P>
    <P>The committal order was signed, according to the gardaí in Rathcoole, by a Dr. Browne who was a locum for the woman's own GP but who did not examine her, and by a Dr. Ollinger whom the woman had neither seen nor heard of. While she was in St. Patrick's she was examined by Dr. Matt Murphy who decided she should not be in there and refused to sign the temporary reception order.  This woman, who applied for free legal aid but was told she would have to wait for four months and eventually made the barring order application herself, had the considerable resources of the Garda, <Col N="1842" /> the ambulance service and two doctors used against her.</P>
    <P>This drama happened in broad daylight in a Dublin suburb, carefully planned and timed.  This woman was treated like a criminal or a terrorist who could not be left free.  Her neighbours and friends are outraged, all right thinking people are outraged, and those gardaí and doctors who became implicated in this plot are, I hope, examining their actions.  In Dublin it is fairly certain people will come to the assistance of a woman like this, but what would happen in a remote village or townland?  A person could be whisked away in a matter of hours and no one would raise a voice.</P>
    <P>What are the legal facts?  This committal was carried out under the provisions of section 184 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, but from my observations the requirements were not observed.  The Act provides that two medical officers have to certify that each has examined the person to whom the application relates on a date not earlier than seven days before the date of the application and is of the opinion that the person is suffering from mental illness and requires for his recovery not more than six months suitable treatment and is unfit on account of his mental state for treatment as a voluntary patient.  We have Victorian mental health legislation to deal with problems in an era of high technology medicine.  Why are we operating with a 46 year old law when so much positive change in medical practice has come about and there has been a revolution in public understanding and awareness of mental health?</P>
    <P>In my research I discovered a more up to date Act, the Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981, of 26 sections, which is in no way a comprehensive answer to what I want but makes some reforms.  It is a dead Act.  It never came into force because no ministerial order was made to put its provisions in force.  Why not?</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister for Health was here to answer the questions.  Can the Minister of State tell me how these doctors and gardaí could collude to commit this woman?  Why was this woman committed <Col N="1843" /> at all?  Why was the protection order which was in the Garda station not taken note of?</P>
    <P>The Minister bears responsibility for the present state of law which can allow similar abuses any time.  I am seeking a review and a report on each of involuntary committal in all mental hospitals in this country in the past 20 years.  I am seeking a repeal of the 1945 Act, and a new code of law for the treatment of mental health.  There are many wives in poor marriages caught in an impossible state from a legal point of view.  They have cause to fear tonight while this 1945 Act remains on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the constitutional protection of the woman in the home is a sick joke when an outrage like this can be done by the State against her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me say both the Minister for Health and I are very concerned about this very traumatic case.  I regret that the Minister for Health, who is tied up with Government business away from the House, could not be here nor could my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, who is indisposed and has not been here today.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the House that there are safeguards incorporated in the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, to ensure that a patient is not detained without due cause.  The compulsory admission to and detention of a patient in any psychiatric hospital, including private psychiatric hospitals, is also specified in the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, and the application for such admission requires the signature of two doctors.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health will ask the inspector of mental hospitals to investigate the circumstances surrounding the admission and discharge to St. Patrick's Hospital of the patient in question already referred to by Deputy Fennell. This will be done as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cotter has given me notice of his intention to raise the closure of laundries at Monaghan General Hospital and at St. Davnet's Hospital, Monaghan and the subsequent job losses.  Deputy Cotter knows the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I will be discussing pales into insignificance when compared with the previous matter for discussion.  Nevertheless, it is very important to me and to many people in Monaghan. At the outset I compliment the staffs of the two hospitals in question. Indeed, I have great admiration for the quality of their work under the most difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>I have in my possession a letter signed by many people asking that the laundry service be maintained in Monaghan.  The background to this affair is as follows. The health board decided to close the laundries at Monaghan General Hospital and St. Davnet's Hospital a few months ago.  The laundry in Cavan is now to do all the work formerly carried out by the two laundries in Monaghan.  This move was justified by the health board on the basis of cost savings.  Indeed, there may be an element of savings involved, though I am not at all convinced that that is the case.  We will have collection and delivery costs now which we did not have formerly. They will be quite high and there will be other costs to be taken into account which would not be of a financial nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First there are the job losses.  There are eight people working in the laundry in the general hospital and four working in the laundry in St. Davnet's.  I understand the permanent staff are to be taken into the two hospitals as domestic staff. This begs the question: will that mean temporary and part-time staff will be pushed out?  I think so, otherwise the <Col N="1845" /> health board will be saving nothing at that level.  I imagine that is part of the plan.</P>
    <P>Second, I want to mention morale in the hospitals.  It is generally known that in recent years morale in the health services had been very low because of low staffing levels of both nursing and domestic staff. Nurses have been greatly overworked and regularly have to carry out non-nursing duties which should be carried out by domestic staff.  Closing the laundries at this time is a cause of further unease. It is seen as downgrading the hospitals, particularly the general hospital in Monaghan which has been under threat before and this is another blow for morale.</P>
    <P>It is the opinion of many people that the Minister for Health and the North-Eastern Health Board are undermining the viability of Monaghan General Hospital at this time.  They have decided to close the laundry service having already failed to bring the mobile coronary unit into operation.  There is a mobile coronary unit lying idle in Monaghan which should be providing a good and much needed service.  Further, the North-Eastern Health Board have decided to build only part of the proposed extension to the hospital.  Clearly there is a backroom conspiracy here.  Many people are unsettled by that and it is a cause of great concern.</P>
    <P>I have to report to the House as well that there was a bout of local &ldquo;electionitis&rdquo; yesterday at the North-Eastern Health Board meeting where a number of councillors from the Minister's party who had already voted in favour of closing the laundries in question decided to change their minds.  I imagine there is an element of fear that the Monaghan voters may well reject them for their folly.  I think the Minister should be aware that he will have support from his own party in Monaghan for maintaining the services in the hospital.</P>
    <P>I am requesting the Minister to intervene in this matter.  I want him to revitalise the plans for the provision of a central laundry for the county which will serve the two hospitals I mentioned and St. Mary's Hospital, Castleblayney.  It could <Col N="1846" /> be made into a very efficient unit where job losses would be avoided only the costs involved in transporting garments, bedding, etc. long distances to have them cleaned in Cavan will be avoided.  Taking everything into account, I think the correct decision here would be to build a central laundry for the three hospitals in Monaghan town.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take note of what I am saying and act upon it immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would point out that the organisation and provision of laundry services for hospitals in the North Eastern Health Board region is primarily a matter for the North Eastern Health Board.  We are all aware of the need to provide the best value for money in the health services.  The inefficient use of money in one area means less money available for another.  The North Eastern Health Board are, therefore, looking at ancillary services in their hospitals to ascertain if these are being provided in the most effective and efficient manner. That is good management.  I understand it has become very clear to the board in recent years that the smaller and older laundries in their area are not processing laundry efficiently.</P>
      <P>In order to improve on the present position, the board now proposes to rationalise laundry services in their area and to provide this service from their two larger laundries at Cavan General Hospital, which is a modern new hospital, and Louth County Hospital.  This proposal involves the closure of laundries at Monaghan General, St. Davnet's and St. Brigid's Hospitals.  I understand that a number of laundry staff will be retained at each of these hospitals for laundry collection, dispatch and other related duties.  The remainder of the laundry staff will be re-deployed to vacant attendant posts in each hospital so there will be no job losses.  The North Eastern Health Board estimate that revenue savings this year alone will be of the order of £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cotter strayed away from the <Col N="1847" /> laundry issue into various other issues. The House should be aware that major improvements are being carried out at present to outpatient services at Monaghan Hospital.  Deputy Cotter must be fully aware that when his party were in Government their policy was to close down Monaghan Hospital but, obviously, they are now having a change of heart. Were it not for the Trojan work of the then shadow Minister, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon and the assistance of his colleague, Deputy Leonard, there would be no need for laundry services because there would be no hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this very important health matter which is affecting patient care in the south east region and particularly in the new hospital in Ardkeen.  It gives us no pleasure to raise these subjects but we have a crisis in the health services.  Is the Minister aware of that crisis?  The Minister should intervene immediately in this dispute which has led to a stoppage of work by nurses in Ardkeen Hospital.</P>
      <P>I compliment the nurses for the way they acted in this dispute which was to highlight the difficulties in staff levels at the hospital.  Their picket was not an allout picket.  They also managed to introduce, with some assistance from their colleagues, a procedure whereby no patient was neglected today at the Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision by the nursing staff to have this one-day token strike was a difficult one for them.  Bearing in mind the <Col N="1848" /> mounting problems facing them and the intolerable working conditions in Ardkeen Hospital they were left with no other option.</P>
    <P>The nursing staff are demanding a minimum of an extra 14 nurses so that their nursing duties can be carried out in accordance with their medical training and their responsibilities.  Last year the workload at this hospital &mdash; a new regional hospital &mdash; increased by a staggering 25 per cent in many faculties and by more in some.  The increased activities affect all areas of treatment.  This increase in workload has occurred in the paediatric unit, in the intensive care unit where consultant anaesthetists were increased from one to three, in medical and surgical wards, the neonatal wards and the day care wards.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, 13 patients required beds in the day care ward but three beds were available.  Like a game of chess the nurses had to move patients from beds to chairs such was the demand in the day care ward yesterday.  Does the Minister expect the same service in this hospital to be maintained by the board when the activity of the hospital has increased by almost 25 per cent, when the allocation has not been increased in accordance with that and the nursing levels have not been increased to meet this demand?  There have been some increases over the past two years but nurses are not able to keep pace with the demands.</P>
    <P>The Minister has agreed to spend £36 million on this new purpose built 424 bed hospital.  The Minister in the House this year, in reply to one of my questions, said: &ldquo;This hospital is geared to the needs of the 21st century.&rdquo;  Yet, at the same time, he expects the existing staff numbers to service the extra beds and units. It would appear rather contradictory that a Minister on the one hand is prepared to invest £36 million without providing the proper and adequate staffing.  Surely, in the context of the overall cost of the hospital, the provision of a mere extra 14 nurses would be a reasonable request.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1849" /> The decision of the staff in Ardkeen Hospital to go on strike to highlight the impossible working conditions they are expected to work under is a mere microcosm of events occurring in all health boards.

      <P>What will have to happen before the Minister takes note of the chronic financial circumstances in our health services?  The South-Eastern Board, who are responsible for this hospital, have the worst nurse-patient ratio in the country.  The Minister has been made aware of this by the board on numerous occasions yet he chooses to ignore it.  The responsibility does not rest with the health boards &mdash; which the Minister is likely to say &mdash; but with the Minister and the Department of Health whose allocation to this health board is insufficient. I have said that before in the House.</P>

      <P>Ongoing negotiations between the South-Eastern Health Board and the Irish Nurses Organisation, have been taking place on claims by the INO for increased staffing levels at Ardkeen Hospital.  The INO are seeking the creation of 14 additional nursing posts at the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1850" /> Within the terms of the Department's personnel policy; agencies are provided with overall staffing ceilings, within which they must operate.  Autonomy exists, however, to target staffing resources to areas of priority need, within the parameters of overall staffing levels, and the financial allocation.  It is a matter, therefore, for the South-Eastern Health Board to determine the appropriate staffing levels, in each of their institutions and other services, within their approved employment ceiling, and their financial allocation.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years 31 extra nursing posts have been created at Ardkeen. In addition 50 nurses employed in a temporary capacity at Ardkeen have been made permanent.  The annual costs of these measures alone is circa £700,000.</P>
    <P>I would like to confirm what Deputy Ferris said that a total of 13 day patients went through the day care unit yesterday.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the turnover in a unit.  The Deputy is not comparing like with like.  How many people go through and how many can attend is a medical decision.</P>
      <P>In the course of the ongoing discussions with the INO &mdash; the most recent meeting took place on 14 May, just one week ago &mdash; the South-Eastern Health Board agreed to the establishment of a joint management-staff committee to examine and revise duty rosters.  This committee are at present examining the situation. The South-Eastern Health Board also sought the agreement of the INO to the reassignment of a small number of nurses within the hospital to areas of greatest need on an interim basis, pending the outcome of the discussions.  Regrettably agreement could not be reached on this reassignment request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the ongoing negotiations on these matters, the INO decided to hold a 24-hour work stoppage on today, 21 May, to highlight their claims for extra <Col N="1851" /> staff.  Emergency cover was provided. The South-Eastern Health Board regrets that the INO should have decided to adopt this action at this time during the negotiations.  It is the intention of the South-Eastern Health Board to hold further meetings with the INO on the outstanding issues at the earliest possible date.  I am sure the House and the Deputies present will share my concern that these discussions lead to an agreed solution to the problems involved and that all avenues of negotiation will be pursued before recourse is again had to industrial action.</P>

      <P>I am receiving correspondence from a variety of women who were deprived of their livelihood when there was a ban on married women working in the public service in the 1950s. One lady who was a teacher wrote to me last week from County Mayo with a most sorrowful story.  She was stopped from teaching in the mid-fifties when she married, and because she was a member of the Church of Ireland her chances of getting a school after the ban was lifted was even more difficult.  She eventually obtained a teaching job in a Catholic school but missed valuable years of service for which she has been penalised severely.  She now lives on a pittance of a pension compared to what she should have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are thousands of these cases coming up now.  What consideration has the Minister for such people?  There must be a huge element of discrimination here. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that some women or a group of women will contest this issue in a court of law. Do we want another protracted and costly case in the European Court?  Fair play demands that such women do not suffer twice in their lifetime.  They suffered as a result of being told to stay at home when they should have been <Col N="1852" /> allowed to work and now they are suffering because they are not receiving the same pension entitlements as every other person in the service who had been allowed to continue to work on marriage.</P>
    <P>There is a very reasonable case here. This will be a very serious problem because it is only at this stage that this sort of case will arise.  In all justice the Government should take a very close look at this issue because there is discrimination, and it will have to be addressed some time.  It is in this country that it should be addressed and not in Europe as in some former cases which have cost the taxpayer dearly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The case to which the Deputy refers is still before the courts, as the Deputy may know, and it arises from a delay in implementing equal treatment.</P>
      <P>In relation to the case raised by the Deputy, where a person leaves the work force, entitlement to short term benefits is retained only for as long as the contribution conditions continue to be satisfied. This can be for a period of up to two years after leaving work.  Any contributions paid are of course reckonable for pensions in the longer term.  Credited contributions which maintain social insurance cover, including cover for pension entitlements, may be awarded for periods of proven unemployment or certified incapacity.  Where a person leaves the work force to take care of their family, they do not in the normal course qualify for credited contributions.</P>
      <P>I know that in the past, many women felt that they &ldquo;lost out&rdquo; on social welfare entitlements because of the time which they spent working in the home and out of the paid workforce.  I have taken a number of initiatives to improve their situation and to bring the social welfare system into line with the requirements of today's society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently extended social insurance to 27,000 part time workers.  This is a major step in providing these workers who are <Col N="1853" /> mainly women with entitlements to social welfare payments in their own right.  I also extended social insurance to self-employed workers.  This has given independent cover for pensions to thousands of spouses, all of whom would have had to rely on means-tested payments in the event of their husband's death.  They also now qualify as contributory adult dependants on their husbands attaining age 66.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance which I introduced last November provides an independent weekly payment mainly to women who care for elderly pensioners.</P>
    <P>The extension of the dental and optical benefit schemes to the dependent spouses of qualified insured persons was a positive move by the Government.  It recognises the real needs of dependent spouses, mainly women working in the home, for dental and ophthalmic care.  To date some 160,000 dependent spouses mainly women have received treatment under the extended schemes.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, today's women and men in balancing their time between their families and the workplace, want options which meet their individual needs. Career breaks, worksharing and flexitime are examples of developments which have taken place to accommodate this trend.</P>
    <P>The question of providing protection for social insurance entitlements already built up by workers in the light of these developments is one with which I have been concerned for some time.  One way of providing such protection especially for women is to extend the credits facility to cover situations where time out from the workforce is taken for family responsibilities.  I am very interested in the possibilities of this approach and we are examining this issue at present.</P>

Pension entitlement for women who work in the home or who have taken time out from work for family responsibilities are aspects of pensions which will be considered in that context.  In other words, I am aware of the difficulties expressed by Deputy Connaughton and the National Pensions Board will report later in the summer on that aspect of pensions. However, they are very complex issues, as the Deputy will appreciate.</P>

      <P>The very efficient and courteous manager of the employment exchange in Lismore, County Waterford, is retiring on 31 May, that is, next Friday week, and there is no guarantee that the employment exchange will be retained in the town after that date.  I am asking for an assurance from the Minister tonight that such an exchange will continue to operate in Lismore.</P>
      <P>There are 310 people signing on at this exchange currently and if it was closed, the alternatives would be for these people to sign on at the exchanges in Dungarvan, Fermoy or possibly Youghal or to sign on at the local Garda station in Lismore, Tallow, Cappoquin and Ballyduff.  We should not call on these stations to provide the service.  They would probably not be very happy about it, nor would they be able to cope with the work involved if the exchange no longer existed.  It is vital that the exchange service be continued for the convenience of the public.  It is a black spot where employment is concerned and the Minister for Labour has included it in his scheme of particular deprived areas.  He has introduced a new scheme whereby 12 areas in the country are to be given special treatment to deal with unemployment and this area, around Lismore, has been designated as one of the areas in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister tonight give a firm <Col N="1855" /> commitment that the employment exchange in Lismore will remain in that town, in that premises or in some other premises in the town?  It is imperative that a commitment be given.  I do not want to see the exchange closing on 31 May, because it may never reopen, and I do not want to see it kept open on a very temporary basis just to carry over through the local elections.  I want to see it retained on a permanent basis.  The Ceann Comhairle, as a Dáil Deputy, who represented that part of west Waterford so nobly for so many years will understand how remote an area it is and how difficult a problem it would create if the exchange were to close permanently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's services to unemployed persons who are resident in the Lismore area are at present provided through a branch employment office located in the town.  Branch employment offices provide a limited range of services.  Their managers are employed under a contract for service which requires them to provide their own staff and premises.</P>
      <P>The Lismore office serves 275 unemployed people.  Eighty-one of these claim unemployment benefit, 181 claim unemployment assistance and 13 sign for credited contributions.  Of these, 207 people attend the office in person each week to sign the unemployment register and receive payment.  The others sign at Garda stations and are paid at their local post office.</P>
      <P>The branch manager in Lismore is retiring from his position with effect from 1 June next.  I would like to pay tribute to the retiring manager.  For almost 40 years he has provided for my Department's clients in Lismore a standard of service which has been exemplary in all respects.  I would like to formally record my appreciation of his dedication and commitment.  He and his wife and family have my best wishes for a long and happy retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" /> The retirement of the branch manager affords me an opportunity to review the arrangements which have been in place for many decades.  While these have worked well in the past, recent developments, particularly in the information technology area, have seen major changes in the way in which my Department can deliver their services to our clients.  Clients now want more information at local level, not only about unemployment payments but also about their entitlements generally.</P>
    <P>My aim is to provide improved access to social welfare services.  As part of this plan I will shortly announce a major restructuring of my Department.  The new structure will be based on local and regional offices, each of which will administer the full range of my Department's services and provide improved access to information for clients across all our schemes.  I am at present reviewing all the options available to me to achieve these aims in the south-east.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that in the interim arrangements have been made to ensure continuity of the existing service to clients in Lismore following the retirement of the branch manager.  From 2 June next the office will be staffed by officials of my Department.  This arrangement will continue until such time as a decision is taken regarding the nature and scope of the service which best suits the people of Lismore.</P>

      <P>There has been an alarming increase in juvenile crime in recent times in the town of Tralee.  Many young offenders involved are allowed to walk the streets unpunished because of the lack of places available in juvenile detention centres.  In one case both a young offender and his family pleaded with the authorities to have him placed in a detention centre.  However, there was no place for him.</P>
      <P>Tralee has recently experienced a large number of break-ins, both to businesses and private houses.  The residents of Boherbee, Tralee, recently set up a special traders' association to organise themselves against the threat to their livelihoods posed by local criminals, both juvenile offenders and more seasoned criminals.</P>
      <P>The people of Castleisland are very concerned about the spate of vandalism in their town that has taken place recently and during the past few years.  Break-ins have occurred in schools, the convent, shops and lately in private homes.  I have a list of 54 households the occupants of which live in fear, most of them are living alone and those who have been victims of robberies and threats find it very difficult to get over the trauma of their experiences.</P>
      <P>There has been a very worrying increase in vandalism and the number of break-ins in the town of Listowel recently.  That town is usually very quiet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are coping with the problem as well as they can.  Extra gardaí are needed on the ground in those towns so that more foot patrols can be <Col N="1858" /> provided, otherwise the situation could get out of hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of Garda manpower to individual areas is entirely a matter for the Garda authorities who inform me that measures are being taken to deal with the particular crime situation in the Listowel, Tralee and Castleisland areas.  These include the effective deployment of regular foot and mobile patrols in the areas concerned and, in addition, extra patrols have been put into operation to meet the specific needs of certain areas.  The gardaí are actively involved in promoting community based crime prevention schemes, such as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert, in the areas concerned and a number of such schemes have been established and are operating satisfactorily. The gardaí also offer crime prevention advice to all sections of the community and, in particular, close liaison exists with local traders, with a view to making their premises more secure.</P>
      <P>I have studied the figures relating to both gardaí manpower and crime in the district.  Manpower has remained at the same strength for the past three years; there has been no depletion in the number of gardaí available; crime decreased from 204 reported crimes in 1988 to 139 reported crimes in 1990 and for the first three months of this year the number of reported crimes stood at 33.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there has been a major increase in crime in the past two months, but for the first quarter of the year the figures were static or reducing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>My grievance arose from a public relations scam on the part of the Minister for Justice last week.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced, in a blaze of publicity, the opening of legal aid centres in Letterkenny and Dundalk.  Those centres had been promised by the Minister and, indeed, also by his predecessor some three years ago.</P>
      <P>My problem relates directly to the legal aid centre at Portlaoise, which has ceased operation, in effect, that centre has closed down.  I do not intend to enter into argument with the Minister on the history of legal aid services in Ireland, suffice to say that placing the scheme on a statutory footing was promised as long ago as 1986, when the then Minister of Justice stated that the Department had the required legislation at an advanced stage of preparation. Nothing has happened since.</P>
      <P>Portlaoise had a legal aid centre but that centre was closed down.  It is one thing to have no service at all, but it is reprehensible and disgraceful to have a service withdrawn overnight.  Clients and people with problems had entered into commitments with officers of the legal aid service in the area.  Work is unfinished and uncertainty and confusion are now the order of the day.</P>
      <P>There are hundreds of family law problems throughout County Laois and County Offaly that are at present being ignored.  Clerks of the District Court, officials of the Minister's own Department, are now operating the service by means of issuing District Court summonses and applications.  Surely the Minister will admit that is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental thread of the legal aid system is service, but there is no service to the people of County Laois or County Offaly when they are expected to <Col N="1860" /> travel as far as Waterford or Dublin as a result of the service at Athlone being grossly understaffed and overworked.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister why the midland area has been abandoned and why we hear promises of the same funds being allocated when, in effect, those promises are nothing more than a public relations effort before the local elections.  The Minister would accept that the issue of family law is expanding to meet the needs of the public, yet areas such as County Laois and the town of Portlaoise have been completely abandoned and the service is crumbling.  I ask the Minister to address the matter at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially, the Legal Aid Board operated a part-time law centre in Portlaoise.  Due to staffing problems experienced by the board, which became acute about four years ago, the service from the law centre was suspended.  The amelioration of the board's staffing difficulties in the interim has not been such as to allow the board to resume the part-time service from Portlaoise.</P>
      <P>With the significant expansion of the scheme, which will take place this year as announced recently by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, and referred to by Deputy Flanagan, I am confident that the board will reassess the position in relation to the provision of legal services under the scheme at Portlaoise.  I will bring the discussion in the House this evening to the attention of the board; I should point out that while the Minister's formal approval for the opening of full time law centres is specifically required under paragraph 6.1.2 of the civil legal aid scheme, the board can open part-time law centres &mdash; such as the one previously in operation in Portlaoise &mdash; on their own initiative and without reference to the Minister in accordance with paragraph 6.2.3 of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that Portlaoise was previously considered by the board as a suitable venue for a full-time <Col N="1861" /> law centre in 1986.  This formed part of a proposed expansion under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984, for provision for civil legal aid.  The Deputy's party in Government at that time did not proceed with the proposal due to funding problems with the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice hopes to continue with the development of the civil legal aid scheme on a phased basis depending on the overall budgetary position. Accordingly, the position regarding the provision of a full-time law centre in Portlaoise will be considered in this context.</P>
    <P>The House must acknowledge and accept the fact that the Minister for Justice has made trojan efforts in providing extra staff and funding for the free legal board which is a measure of his commitment to the scheme and the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak about the difficulties in operating the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, relating to teenage drinking.  The law in relation to teenage drinking offences should be repealed because teenagers in their thousands are breaking it every week.  However, there were only 140 prosecutions during 1990 for teenage offences under the Act.  This part of the Act is clearly in disrepute and has done nothing to protect teenagers from ruthless exploitation.  For those reasons it is bad legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was the legislation updated?  The reason was &mdash; I remember it well because I was teaching at the time &mdash; that there was enormous public demand for more effective legislation.  Sadly, however, there has not been any change, if anything it has got worse.  The law was intended to protect teenagers from exploitation by people who are interested only in making money.  The Act has spectacularly failed in that respect and as <Col N="1862" /> a result many people are saddened and disappointed.  Why has the Act failed so lamentably?  Is it because the Minister does not have the will to apply it?  Is it because the legislation is inoperable? Whatever the reason, it has resulted in disaster because 140 prosecutions is the highest number recorded; in previous years the numbers were fewer.  I should like to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has already forwarded to Deputy Cotter details of prosecutions for supplying or selling drink to persons under 18 in 1989 and 1990.  If the Deputy compares those figures with the number of prosecutions under this heading instituted in the six years before the 1988 Intoxicating Liquor Act came into force &mdash; these figures are available in the reports of the Garda Commissioner on crime for the relevant years &mdash; he will see that there has been a dramatic increase.  In the seven year period from 1984 to 1990 the numbers are as follows: in 1984, when the Deputy's party were in power, there were 18 prosecutions; in 1985 there were 22 prosecutions; in 1986 there were six prosecutions; in 1987 there were 21 prosecutions; in 1988 there were 29 prosecutions; in 1989 there were 121 prosecutions, the 1990 figures are being compiled at present and will be in excess of the 1989 figures.</P>
      <P>One of the new curbs on under-age drinking contained in the 1988 Act is that it is now an offence for a person under 18 years of age to purchase or to consume drink in any place other than in a private residence.  In the two years since the operation of the Act, the number of prosecutions under this heading was 135 in 1989 and 133 in 1990, which is a very encouraging sign in such a short space of time.  On the basis of these statistics the provisions are working as it was intended they should.</P>

    <P>It should not be forgotten that the <Col N="1863" /> question of implementing the very wide-ranging and comprehensive legislative provisions to combat under-age drinking is a matter for the Garda.  Everyone has a part to play in that process and breaches of the law must be reported to the Garda if the law is to be implemented with the necessary vigour by them.</P>
    <P>On the related question of identity cards and controls over drink outlets in supermarkets, the Minister dealt with both of these issues in some detail in this House on two occasions, on 6 March last and again on 2 May and I have nothing to add to those remarks.</P>
    <P>We are simply deluding ourselves if we think that more legislation is the panacea for the problem of alcohol abuse by young persons.  We already have in place <Col N="1864" /> a sound legislative basis for action.  Further moves lie ahead in the area of education, particularly to help young persons themselves to make informed decisions about alcohol.  Indeed, a comprehensive major research project has been commissioned by the Advisory Council on Health Promotion as a prelude to the drawing up of a national policy on alcohol and I am pleased to be associated with that.  This matter was outlined in detail by the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, in this House on 26 February last.  This policy will address the broader issues involved in alcohol abuse by young persons, such as the economic, social, educational, cultural and health factors, which impinge on the problem.  The Minister will await developments in this regard with interest.</P>

      <P>I have been following developments in Yugoslavia with grave concern.  I regret in particular the tragic loss of life <Col N="1599" /> that has occurred as a result of interethnic confrontation.</P>
      <P>I consider that Ireland can best contribute to a solution to the problems of Yugoslavia by working towards that end in close co-operation with our partners in the European Community.  On numerous occasions, through public declarations as well as by way of approaches to the parties concerned, the Twelve have made clear their wish to see the integrity of Yugoslavia maintained on the basis of democracy, pluralism and full respect for the human rights of all its citizens.  On 8 May, the Luxembourg Presidency, on behalf of the Twelve, issued a statement reiterating our firm opposition to the use of force and restating our view that only dialogue between all the parties concerned will provide a lasting solution to the present grave crisis.</P>
      <P>The President of the European Council, Mr. Santer, and the President of the European Commission, Mr. Delors, will visit Belgrade later this month.  While there, they will meet with the Federal authorities and with the leaders of the republics.  They will restate the Twelve's views and will encourage them to reach a peaceful solution to their problems through dialogue.</P>

      <P>I understand that the incident to which the Deputy refers occurred on 27 November 1989 off the coast of Skerries, when the MFV <i>Marie McClements</i> was <Col N="1600" /> apparently dragged backwards for three quarters of a mile.  On the basis of the statements later submitted by the crew to the Department of the Marine, it appears that this incident may have been caused by the vessel catching a passing submarine in its nets, although I should point out that the vessel was not, apparently, fishing in a submarine exercise area at the time.</P>
      <P>This was clearly a dangerous incident, but there has been no evidence of the nationality of the submarine.  As I have indicated on previous occasions, claims for damages to fishing vessels are essentially a civil matter, in which the Government have no involvememt.  In cases involving unidentified vessels, however the Government take whatever action is open to them to assist identification, in order to facilitate any action for damages that may be taken.  As the nationality of the submarine in this case however, has not been identified, a private insurance claim may be the most obvious course open to the owner of the vessel.</P>
      <P>Finally, and on a more general note, I would like to take this opportunity to underline the concern of the Government in relation to the safety of Irish fishing vessels at sea.  We avail of every possible opportunity to highlight, in international fora, the dangers which submarines pose to fishing and other vessels in the waters around our coast.  As an indication of our serious concern we are raising the matter again at the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and we will continue to avail of other opportunities through diplomatic contacts with representatives of countries whose submarines have been identified in incidents involving Irish fishing trawlers.</P>

The Contras or the Nicaraguan resistance, as they are referred to by the United Nations, have been demobilised and the Secretary General has expressed himself satisfied with progress made in this area.

      <P>Mrs. Chamorro's Government have moved towards an open market economy. The Sandinistas, who retain positions of influence in the administration and the armed forces, and hold a substantial proportion of seats in the National Assembly, have played their part in efforts to overcome the difficulties which are facing the country.  A significant reduction in army strength has been achieved, in line with the objectives of the Central American Security Commission and the Esquipulas process.</P>

The last non-career appointment as Head of Mission was made in 1949.

      <P>The Government have been deeply concerned about the reports of the illtreatment of Palestinians following the liberation of Kuwait.  It seems clear that there was a backlash from some Kuwaitis not only against suspected collaborators but against Palestinians in Kuwait in general.

This is the first such report by the Commission and it will serve as a useful basis for assessing progress in achieving equality of opportunity.</P>
      <P>A number of the conclusions which can be drawn from the report give cause for concern.  Among these is evidence of under-representation of members of the Catholic community at management and administrative levels in both the public and private sectors, in many areas of district council employment including at management and administrative grades and in certain key areas of the private sector such as financial services, the energy and water supply industries and the engineering industry.</P>
      <P>These conclusions underline the need for effective measures to ensure equality of opportunity for all.  The Government welcome the 1989 Fair Employment Act as a serious attempt to respond to the problem of discrimination.

As regards national policy towards South Africa, including the question of sanctions, the Taoiseach has made it clear in recent statements in the Dáil that Irish policy, too, will evolve in line with developments in South Africa.</P>
      <P>With respect to the second part of the Deputy's question, the legislative proposals currently before the South African Parliament will, once enacted, remove the remaining pillars of the apartheid system.  I refer here to the draft Bills to repeal the Group Areas Act and the Land Acts, and to repeal the Population Registration Act, subject to certain transitional arrangements.  These essential reforms will eliminate the statutory basis of the apartheid system and greatly enhance the prospects for negotiations on the establishment of a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa.  The new, pluralist South Africa must be the fruit of all-party negotiations aimed at drawing up a new constitution which guarantees to all South Africans an effective role in the governing of their own country. As the Taoiseach has already said in the Dáil, President de Klerk, during his visit to Ireland on 25 April gave us firm assurances that his programme is to move steadily towards a pluralist democracy in South Africa.  The Government believe that these assurances can be accepted and that President de Klerk is fully committed to the abolition of apartheid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have not submitted any paper to the conference on this matter.  However, we have clearly expressed our views in the conference as <Col N="1610" /> to how existing procedures can be enhanced to allow the European Parliament to play a more effective role in the Community's decision making process.</P>
      <P>We already know of the very strong views held by the Parliament about what it feels its role should be and what it wishes to see from the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union.  Some member states are able to support almost everything the Parliament is looking for whilst others are more reserved.  For our part, we will look carefully at the demands of Parliament and see what improvements can be made to existing procedures.  We will also wish to take account of the need to preserve the balance and efficiency in the operation of the Community Institutions as we seek to ensure the democratic legitimacy of the Community and its democratic accountability.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific issue of co-decision, I have already outlined to the House on previous occasions that we have some reservations about the procedure as proposed by some member states and the Parliament.  We believe that the role of the Commission in the legislative process must be maintained, including its sole right to make proposals and its capacity to amend proposals at any stage in the process.</P>
      <P>We do believe however that there has to be a genuine increase in the capacity of Parliament to make a substantial contribution to the legislative process.  For example, this could include giving greater attention in the Council to the first opinion of the Parliament.  We could also envisage the establishment of an effective and more extensive conciliation procedure in which all three Community institutions could meet to resolve outstanding difficulties on draft legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We consider that this can be achieved by improving the status of Parliament's first reading in the co-operation procedure, by facilitating greater consultation with Parliament throughout the process and by improving the existing <Col N="1611" /> conciliation procedure so that any differences can be overcome and compromise reached.</P>

      <P>In the negotiations presently underway to create a European Economic Area EC and EFTA Ministers have agreed on the importance of the objective of greater cohesion through the reduction of regional economic and social disparities. Policies allowing for greater access in the agriculture and fisheries sectors are expected to make a contribution to this goal.  The EC side has in addition proposed the setting up by EFTA of a financial mechanism, or fund, as an <Col N="1613" /> essential element in the process.  Detailed negotiation on this has not yet taken place.  However, at a joint meeting with EC Ministers in Brussels on 13 May EFTA Ministers expressed readiness to consider creation of such a financial mechanism.</P>
      <P>In preparation of the Community negotiating position Ireland have emphasised the importance of overall balance in the agreement and therefore of adequate provisions on cohesion.  We have made substantial input to the Community proposal for a cohesion fund to be established, financed by the EFTA countries alone and clearly separate from the existing EC Structural Funds.  The proposal envisages that the beneficiaries would be primarily those regions of the Community to which objectives 1 criteria of the EC Structural Funds apply.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer has a social welfare pension and <Col N="1614" /> a pension from Meath County Council. Both pensions are taxable.</P>
      <P>However, as the taxpayer's income does not greatly exceed the exemption limit for tax purposes she is entitled to marginal relief.  Marginal relief operates to ensure that the tax payable in respect of the taxpayer's total income is no more than 52 per cent of the excess of her total income over the exemption limit.  In every case in which it applies, it is more favourable to the taxpayer than taxation under the normal system of applying the standard rate to her taxable income, that is income less personal allowances and reliefs.  Though the rate of tax is higher, it is still more favourable because the amount of income to which it applies is considerably less.</P>
      <P>An amended certificate of tax-free allowances which entitles the taxpayer to this marginal relief was issued on 17 May 1991 granting net tax-free allowances of £1,053 for the current year at tax table C (52 per cent.)  Any tax overdeducted will be refunded by Meath County Council on operation of this certificate.</P>
      <P>The Inspector of Taxes has reviewed her liability for the tax years 1989-90 and 1990-91.  She was also entitled to marginal relief for these years.  As overpayments of £15.90 for 1989-90 and £213.28 for 1990-91 have arisen, cheques for these amounts will issue to her within the next ten days.</P>
      <P>The county council have confirmed that PRSI is not being deducted by them, as the taxpayer is not liable to PRSI.</P>

      <P>The conditions currently applying to career breaks for civil servants are as follows: Eligibility: In order to be considered for a career break an officer is required to have satisfactorily completed two years service and must be under the minimum retirement age.  The duration of a career break may not extend beyond minimum retirement age.  The granting of a career break is subject to the exigencies of the work and certain grades with specialist skills have been excluded from the scheme.  Purpose and Duration: Career breaks are available for domestic responsibilities, further education or a stay abroad.  A career break consists of special leave without pay for a period of not less than one year and not more than five years.  It is possible to extend a career break in six monthly periods or in periods in excess of six months provided the total period of special leave does not exceed five years in all. Additional Career Break: One additional career break may be granted provided the period of service between career breaks is equal to the duration of the initial career break and that the total period of the special leave does not <Col N="1618" /> exceed five years in all.  Return to duty: Officers returning to the civil service after a career break have a guarantee of reemployment in a relevant grade within the civil service, but not necessarily within their existing organisation, within a period of 12 months of the date on which they had planned to return to work.</P>
      <P>The total number of civil servants who had taken career breaks up to the end of 1990 was 3,477.</P>

      <P>Wild mink are carnivorous and will eat a wide range of prey.  They differ from most predators in that they often kill many more animals than they need for food.  Their impact on populations of other wild animals can be greatly exaggerated as can the range of animals which they will attack.  A recent study by the Wildlife Service has identified rabbits, cray fish, eels and small perch as their main prey.  The mink is not a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and may be lawfully killed using traps under the Wildlife Act (Approved Traps, Snares and Net Regulations, 1977 S.I. No. 307 of 77) or using legally held shotguns.</P>

      <P>On 6 May 1991, when publishing the Fair Trade Commission report on petrol supply, I announced my intention to de-regulate the petrol supply industry here by removing existing restrictive practice and price controls after the Competition Bill currently before this House is in place.  No suggestion on the lines indicated by the Deputy has since been made to me.  The commission took the view that re-regulation would be beneficial for competition in this industry and that prices would ultimately fall more into line with those in other north western European countries. I made clear in my announcement that I retained the option of reintroducing controls in order to ensure that the consumer benefits anticipated by the commission are indeed realised.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to my reply in this House to his Question No. 170 on 24 October 1990, where I emphasised the impact on petrol prices of different rates of taxation levied here and in Northern Ireland.  As the House will be aware, there has since been further convergence of VAT rates applying here and in Northern Ireland due to 1991 budgetary decisions by the respective Governments.</P>

      <P>Only one working group meeting was chaired by an officer of my Department during the course of the EC Presidency. This was a meeting of the Economic Questions group which dealt with the 9th Amendment to Directive 76/769.  In addition, during the Irish Presidency, officers of my Department chaired a number of meetings which co-ordinated the policies of EC member states specifically at the International Labour Conference in Geneva, in June, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council working group which deals with social policy matters generally is the Social Questions Group.  That group was chaired during the Presidency by the Social Affairs Counsellor in Brussels who is an officer of the Department of Labour but who is seconded to the Department of Foreign Affairs during the period of service in Brussels.  That group normally meets twice a week.  The <Col N="1634" /> number of meetings of the group during the six month period of the Presidency will be included in the figures supplied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in reply to another question.</P>

There are no arrears of this supplement due to him which ceased to be payable in January 1991 when his wife became an adult dependant in respect of whom an increase is now being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> Deductions of £3 are being made from his weekly entitlement of £89.90.  The deductions relate to an overpayment which occurred prior to October 1988. The amount remaining to be recovered by deductions is £338 and deductions will continue for approximately two more years.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme on 7 November 1990 in respect of an accident at work on 2 August 1988 while employed as a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>To have a claim for occupational injuries benefit accepted, the claimant is required to be employed in employment which is insurable for occupational injuries benefit.  Under the Social Welfare Acts, employment as a Garda Síochána was not insurable for occupational injuries benefit until 6 April 1989 when the scheme was extended to include such employment.  Under the statutory provisions, the extension applies only to occupational accidents happening on or after that date.  As the claim in question was in respect of an accident at work in August 1988 it could not be allowed.</P>
      <P>A Garda who suffers an occupational accident may claim compensation under a scheme administered by the Department of Justice.  It is understood that a claim under that scheme is being pursued in this case.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 117 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>A bilateral agreement with the United States is included in my programme to complete social security agreements with countries which are outside of the EC.</P>
      <P>We already have an agreement in place with Austria and I have recently signed agreements with Canada and Australia. These will become operational when both of these countries complete certain internal constitutional requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement which I am currently negotiating with the United States is one to which I attach a great deal of importance in view of the very significant number of Irish emigrants who have spent a considerable part of their working <Col N="1640" /> lives in that country.  Discussions on the text of this agreement have been substantially completed between officials of my Department and their counterpart officials in the United States.  There are however, a number of minor issues still outstanding some of which have constitutional implications and on which legal advice is necessary.  These are being pursued urgently and I would hope that the agreement will be ready for signature within the next few months.</P>
    <P>The agreement when completed will cover the Irish social welfare schemes of contributory old age pension, retirement pensions, contributory widows and orphans' pension, invalidity pension and death grant and on the US side the federal programmes of old age, survivors and disability insurance.  Its main purpose will be to allow periods of employment in one country to be counted towards satisfying the conditions for pension entitlement in the other country.  In addition, on the Irish side, when the agreement becomes operational recipients of US social security pensions, who are resident in Ireland, will become eligible, on a par with Irish pensioners, for free travel, free electricity, free TV licence, free telephone rental and free fuel.  This is as a result of the initiative which I introduced as part of the social welfare improvements in last year's budget.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the available resources are being deployed to best advantage in meeting the current policing needs of the Maynooth, Leixlip and Celbridge areas.  Day, evening and night patrols are already being carried out by the gardaí based at these centres and there are arrangements for 24-hour cover from Lucan station and the divisional headquarters at Naas.

I have no doubt that many towns can lay claim to the need for designation.  However, in order to maximise the impact of the scheme, designation must be restricted to the most urgent cases.

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 41 of 7 May 1991; the position in relation to the rehousing of tenants on the transfer list are identical for all housing authorities.</P>
      <P>I would draw attention to the increased capital allocation to Cork Corporation this year for the provision of local authority housing.  The 1991 allocation of £1,763,000 represents an increase of 107 per cent on the 1990 figure of £850,000 and will enable the corporation to complete work on 56 houses and to commence a further 50 new dwellings.</P>
      <P>In addition, the initiatives announced in <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> provide tenants in overcrowded conditions with further opportunities of obtaining alternative accommodation suitable to their needs.</P>

    <P>With regard to the funding of the Irish Family Planning Association which has been raised by the Deputy, the position is that the association is funded directly by my Department.  A grant of £5,000 was paid to the association in respect of 1989. The application from the Irish Family Planning Association Limited for a grant in respect of 1990 is under consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to parts (4) and (5) of the question, grants have been made by my Department and by the health boards for natural family planning to the National Association of the Ovulation Method in Ireland and the Couple to Couple League.  The National Association of the Ovulation Method in Ireland in its centres throughout the country, teaches and promotes natural family planning methods to couples.  It also provides services such as pregnancy testing, menopause and fertility advice, pre-marriage courses and makes available an &ldquo;Education for Life&rdquo; programme to schools.  As regards the health promotion unit, information on family planning currently available from that unit is being reviewed in the context of the proposed changes in the family planning legislation.</P>
    <P>General practitioners participating in the general medical services scheme provide, as part of their services, information and advice in relation to family planning.</P>

      <P>It is not possible, at this stage of the year, to form a clear view as to the likelihood of any variations from the budgeted cost of drugs in the GMS.  The introduction of a supplementary estimate does not, therefore, arise at this time.  Drug costs will be closely monitored throughout the year, and every effort will be made to ensure that costs are kept to a minimum, consistent with the provisions of an effective service.  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department have developed an integrated strategy to control the cost of drugs while ensuring that patient needs are met.</P>
      <P>As part of this strategy I launched the national drugs formulary earlier this year which <i>inter alia</i> encourages the use of generics.

    <P>As the Deputy will also be aware in the context of the provision of additional places under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there are initiatives for increasing participation in third-level education by mature students through improvements in the higher education grants scheme.  An allocation of third-level places will be made for mature students from disadvantaged areas as an extension of the existing provision for mature students together with support or access programmes where necessary.  In addition, the targeting of places for the disadvantaged would be further strengthened through linkages between specific second-level schools and third-level institutions, the appointment and designation of an appropriate member of the staff of the institution to oversee the linkages, the joint monitoring of performances of <Col N="1668" /> the pupils particularly during the senior cycle and consideration of initiatives from other institutions such as the National College of Industrial Relations.</P>
    <P>The higher education grants scheme will be re-examined in the context of (i) assessing income eligibility of mature students who are not dependent on their parents, on the basis of their own and, if married, that of their spouses' incomes and (ii) mature students who secure a place in a third-level institution as satisfying the academic requirements.</P>

      <P>Section 90 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 provides that Telecom Éireann may make a scheme providing for all charges which are to be made by it and the other terms and conditions which are to be applicable to its services.

Article 52 of this scheme <Col N="1679" /> allows Telecom Éireann to classify telephone exchanges into groups and to determine in relation to each telephone group what telephone groups, if any, are to be regarded as adjacent to it and the point which is to be used for measuring distances for the purpose of charging for telephone calls.</P>
