      <P>Members of the House learned with great sadness last week of the untimely death of John Kelly.</P>
      <P>His retirement from politics in 1989 cut short a distinguished career, which began 20 years earlier when he was elected to the Seanad.  In 1973, he was elected to the Dáil for the first time and was immediately appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and Government Chief Whip.  In the same administration, he also held the post of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as well as serving briefly as Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Between 1977 and 1979 he was Opposition Spokesman on Industry and Commerce, while from 1979 to 1981 he was Spokesman on Economic Planning and Development and Energy.</P>
      <P>In 1981, John Kelly was appointed Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  He also briefly held the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An incisive wit and picturesque turn of phrase made him a most effective and formidable parliamentary debater.  Even when he retired to the backbenches in 1982, he continued to express his opinions trenchantly and it was perhaps <Col N="774" /> from the backbenches that he dispensed some of his most effective broadsides.</P>
    <P>John Kelly was also a distinguished academic.  Educated at Glenstal Abbey; University College, Dublin; Heidelberg University; Oxford University and the King's Inns, Dublin, he practised at the Irish Bar from 1957 to 1962.  He was a fellow and lecturer in law at Trinity College, Oxford between 1961 and 1965 and was a Professor of Jurisprudence and Roman Law at University College, Dublin, from 1965 until his death.  A senior counsel, he published several books on law, including <i>Fundamental Rights in the Irish Law and Constitution, Roman Litigation, Studies in the Civil Judicature of the Roman Republic,</i> and perhaps his most famous work, <i>The Irish Constitution.</i></P>
    <P>A distinguished scholar and a dedicated politician, John Kelly will be greatly missed on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to offer our deepest condolences to his wife, Delphine, his sons Nicholas, David and Bernard, and his daughters Alexia and Julia.</P>
    <P>Ar Dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I express our gratitude to the House for the opportunity that has been afforded to pay tribute to the late John Kelly.  John Kelly will be missed in a very deep sense by all Members of the House but particularly by his closest colleagues in the Fine Gael Party.  He was a politician who was able to give voice &mdash; and it was a very eloquent voice &mdash; to the common values that represent the party of which he was a member.  John was a person who showed tremendous loyalty: loyalty to his friends, loyalty to his colleagues and, indeed, loyalty to his party. I suppose the greatest test of loyalty is to remain loyal even when things are being done with which you do not necessarily fully agree.  John Kelly demonstrated that loyalty in the most expressive way of all during his period as a backbench member of our party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> He was, however, also a very distinguished member of successive Governments. As Government Whip he was responsible for organising the business of the first Coalition Government to take office at that time for 16 years.  Being a Whip is never an easy task but that was obviously a particularly difficult one and John Kelly took on the task with tremendous fortitude, dedication and personal concern for each and every member of the then Government parties.  He was responsible also, as he had said, for initiating improvements in the way we do our business in this House, allowing us to have more civilised sitting hours and thereby making the life of successive generations of Deputies that little bit easier &mdash; something for which we owe John Kelly thanks.  He was, as has been said on a number of occasions, a truly devastating orator.  In my view he was the best parliamentary speaker of his generation and possibly of any generation this century.  He was able to harness wit to illustrate difficult political concepts, which sometimes could not be illustrated otherwise.  He was able to use humour and his sense of acute personal observation not only to expose humbug and hypocritical policies where he had occasion to criticise them but also to show the way forward.</P>
    <P>Some will ask the question, and it is a just question: what was the particular political achievement of John Kelly?  In my view it was that of giving us a respect in this country for our own laws made in this House by our own elected representatives. He was always a consistent critic of the idea that we should adopt legislation from Britain or from any other jurisdiction.  He held the view that this House as a sovereign assembly should make its own policies and its own laws in its own distinctive way; that we should feel no sense of inferiority about what we are capable of doing here in this House in comparison with what might be done in legislatures elsewhere, either in London or other parts of the world.  He, in a true sense, was a tribune of this, a mature democracy and a mature State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> He conveyed that sense to his generation in Dáil Éireann and has conveyed to coming generations of politicians a sense of the worth of our work in this House.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has correctly said, in addition to being a politician, John Kelly was a distinguished scholar.  As an academic dealing with Roman law he earned a worldwide reputation; he was one of the few scholars with a truly worldwide reputation in that particular discipline. His work on the Irish Constitution made that fundamental document &mdash; upon which all our freedoms are based &mdash; accessible to thousands of people who might not otherwise have fully understood it.  Laws that are not properly understood are not laws that protect us. Law is designed to protect.  So, in a sense, by writing as he did about our Constitution in a highly distinguished way, John Kelly enhanced the civil rights of our people by making the laws which protect them more accessible to them than they would otherwise be.</P>
    <P>We all feel a deep sense of loss, the loss, in particular, of a friend to many of us in this House.  I wish to join with the Taoiseach in conveying to his wife, Delphine, and to his sons and daughters the sympathy of my party and the sympathy of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise on behalf of the Labour Party to pay our respects to the memory of the late Deputy John Kelly. John Kelly was a unique man, a scholar, a writer and a politician.  I would not have agreed with many of the views expressed by Deputy Kelly down through the years and, indeed, he would not have agreed with many of the views expressed by me or by the Labour Party.  Nevertheless, one could respect his views which were always delivered in this House with unique style and expressed without fear or favour.  He was a remarkable man in that he combined a fine academic career and his substantial political career for many years.  He will be missed in many aspects of Irish society, in politics and in university life, but he will never be forgotten.  His tremendous work on the Irish Constitution ensures that the name <Col N="777" /> of John Kelly will be revered by students of our Constitution, by practitioners and by politicians.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to express our deepest sympathy to his wife and family on their sad loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, on behalf of The Workers' Party, would like to be associated with the expression of sympathy of this House with the family of John Kelly.  John Kelly and I and my party differed on very fundamental issues and, indeed, he never failed to challenge us in this House to justify our position which we always sought do do.  He always expressed his views frankly and honestly and with a degree of wit, sometimes barbed, but I do not recall him ever being cruel in his expression of his disagreements with us or anybody else in this House.  His political skills, his eloquence and his honesty will be missed by us all, but, most of all, he will be missed by his family.  I want to convey my sympathy and the sympathy of my party to his wife and family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, and on my own behalf, I want to express my deep sympathy on the untimely death of John Kelly.  John Kelly was a brilliant academic, the country's foremost constitutional expert and, representing a rare combination, he was also one of the finest politicians to grace this Chamber.  He was an intelligent, incisive politician who brought rapier-like wit and delightful and creative use of the English language to explode and expose humbug, pomposity and sheer incompetence when he believed he detected it in the political arena.  I came to know him first in 1960 when he lectured on Roman law in UCD, and ever since I have admired his many fine qualities.  He will be sorely missed from Leinster House and from public life, and he will be sadly missed by his family and his friends.  To his wife, Delphine, and his family I express my very deepest sympathy.</P>

      <P>In view of the ongoing war in the Gulf and the concerns to which it gives rise in regard to the economic security and the personal security of Irish citizens, will the Taoiseach state if he proposes to establish any mechanism for consultation with the parties in this House on a confidential basis or otherwise about security matters or foreign affairs, perhaps by the appointment of a foreign affairs committee?  Further, in view of the importance of security generally at the present time, would the Taoiseach agree that the time has come for a full-time Minister for Defence to be <Col N="779" /> appointed as was envisaged in past practice and in the normal operation of this House?  If he does agree, will he indicate when he proposes to ask for time here for the appointment of an addditional Minister?</P>

      <P>I seek clarification on two matters, one of which I should like to bring to the attention of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food who might clarify the position.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the Department of Agriculture and Food are not taking any queries or communications from TDs?  Can anything be done about that or does it just reflect the state of chaos in that Department at present?</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach a number of questions?  First, is it proposed to bring the draft <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> before the House for approval and, if so, when? Will he indicate whether he proposes to enable this House to debate the developments in the Gulf war where at least one of the allies involved in the war have indicated that they intend to go beyond the mandate of the Security Council?  In view of the fact that we have already supported this resolution it is important that we have an opportunity to address this issue.</P>

It is becoming increasingly difficult to cross the Border because of the security arrangement of the British Army on the northern side of the Border, making people's use of the Border very restricted. In this regard I tabled a question to the Taoiseach asking him to deal with the matter but it was referred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Does the Taoiseach consider that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is the appropriate person to deal with matters relating to this State and to Northern Ireland?</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for certain matters relating to the restructuring of Siúicre Éireann CPT.  The primary function of this legislation is to provide for a restructuring which will enable the company to pass from State to a more widely diffused ownership in partial privatisation.</P>
      <P>Before discussing the Bill I would like to set out in general terms the process which has now culminated in the Bill being placed before the House.  Because of their concern for the future of the Sugar Company, in early 1989 the Government commissioned a study on the affairs of Siúicre Éireann and on their future development.  Consultants were appointed and given the following terms of reference: (1) to review the operations of Irish Sugar; (2) to report on any restructuring or other developments considered necessary to ensure their long term commercial viability and growth; (3) to assess the economic and financial implications of any recommendations; and (4) to complete the review and submit a report by the end of March 1989.</P>
      <P>The consultants reported in May 1989 and, in evaluating the options for the future of Siúicre Éireann, concluded that the company could not remain static if their long-term commercial viability and growth were to be ensured.  In September 1989 the Government having considered the report decided that further analysis of the future options for the company was required.  Accordingly a small <i>ad hoc</i> group were set up representative of my Department, the Department of Finance, the Industrial Development Authority and Siúicre Éireann, to prepare a report on all the options for the company's future, including diversification, with a minimum of financial risk.</P>
      <P>The group examined three basic options for the future of Siúicre Éireann. These were: (1) the continuation of the present activities and structure; (2) total privatisation; (3) partial privatisation and commercial development of the company while retaining a degree of State control over their sugar operations and the sugar quota.</P>
      <P>Before commenting on the various options for the future of the company I would like to sketch out briefly some facts about Siúicre Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Siúicre Éireann are, as of now, a public limited company with an issued share capital of £66 million comprising 65.5 million ordinary shares of £1 each and 0.5 million 6 per cent cumulative preference shares of £1 each.  The Minister for Finance holds all the ordinary shares save a <Col N="797" /> small number of qualifying shares held by directors.  The 0.5 million preference shares are held by various investors.</P>
    <P>The main activity of the company is the processing and distribution of sugar. They have almost 100 per cent of the market for sugar in the State and 70 per cent of the market in Northern Ireland and a small market for industrial sugar in Great Britain.  The company are also involved in the food sector and in the recent past have made a number of acquisitions in this area, the most significant of which was a 50 per cent share in Odlums Ltd. with options on the purchase of the remaining 50 per cent.  Agri-trading is the principal other activity of the company who are also involved in recently commenced joint ventures with private companies, notably in Thurles.</P>
    <P>The company have reported net profits on ordinary activities since 1986 and had a record after tax net profit on ordinary activities of £15.353 million in the year ending 30 September 1989 compared with £11.886 million in 1988.  During the period of recovery, profits were applied in reduction of borrowings and large accumulated losses which had been incurred prior to 1986.</P>
    <P>Turnover in the year ending September 1989 was £216 million made up as follows: sugar division, £125 million; food division, £34 million; and agri-trading division, £57 million.</P>
    <P>The turnover consists largely of Irish sales with only £36 million accounted for by sales outside the State.</P>
    <P>The financial results of the company for year ending September 1990 are due to be published shortly, and it is expected that they will show an increase in profits over last year's figures.</P>
    <P>In the year to 30 September 1990 the company employed 1,757 people compared with 1,556 the previous year.  This increase, the first in many years, was essentially as a result of acquisitions during the year.  I am happy to report that at the end of 1990, 187 new jobs had been created in the joint venture replacement industries in Thurles and the target of 384 for the end of 1992 is very clearly realisable.  I am glad to say also <Col N="798" /> that, as regards the old Tuam sugar factory site, planning permission has been sought for the building of a 20,000 sq. ft. advance IDA factory which will bring a new industry to the area.  The Sugar Company will contribute to the cost of this factory, in the context of their commitment to the establishment of new industries in the area following the closure of the sugar factory there.</P>
    <P>The company have undoubtedly made substantial financial progress in recent years and have rigorously pursued a programme of cost competitiveness.  This programme was a difficult one and tough decisions were taken.  The results of these decisions can now be seen in the performance of the company and in their improved financial position.  However, apart from the excellent work of the board, management and staff a major factor in turning the company around was the significant capital investment by the Exchequer.  The Exchequer contributed £30 million equity in 1982, £20 million in 1983 and £9 million in 1987.  This was a major injection which brought the total Exchequer equity up to £65.5 million. There has been and continues to be a considerable cost to the State arising from the provision and servicing of these funds.  As mentioned earlier, no dividend has been paid because of the legal ban on any such payment until accumulated losses have been cleared.  In addition, because of protracted loss-making, the company have paid little corporation tax.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation, when enacted, will at last enable the State to get some return for its investment.  This will be achieved both through the sale of shares and the payment of dividends on the residual Exchequer shareholding following the proposed flotation which I shall refer to shortly.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the different options considered by the <i>ad-hoc</i> group to which I have referred.  I will refer first to the option of continuing the present activities and present structures of the company.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the company's excellent performance in recent years they are <Col N="799" /> expected to continue to operate profitably in the medium term.  The company could therefore continue with the present range of activities and concentrate on further rationalisation as necessary.  On that basis the shareholder could expect a reasonable dividend this year and for some period thereafter.  However, this approach would be appropriate only if the company were prepared in the longer term to remain in a static rather than a dynamic position.  They are not prepared to do that and in any event the environment in which they are likely to have to operate would not allow them to do so.  Possible changes in the Community sugar regime, the outcome of GATT negotiations and the fact that in European terms the company is a moderately sized player in a market tending to be dominated by the large, all point to the need to diversify and expand their base. The future success of the company in their existing activities will thus be dependent on their ability to adapt continually to changes in their business environment.</P>
    <P>While a continual reliance on the core business of the company would yield a return to the Exchequer in the form of receipts from dividends in the short to medium term, such a policy would not provide a basis for the growth and development of the company.  Acceptance of this option, even for a limited number of years, would place the company on an irreversible course from which they could not generate the resources to recover.</P>
    <P>There is also the consideration that the disposal of shares by the State at a later stage, if in the meantime the company were to continue only with existing activities, would fail to maximise the return on the State investment.</P>
    <P>The business environment changes affecting Siúicre Éireann make it imperative for the company to embark on a policy of carefully planned expansion away from its existing core business into areas that are complementary and in which their operational, technical and managerial expertise can be applied to good advantage.  Indeed the programme <Col N="800" /> of rationalisation that had been undertaken by the company in recent years must be viewed as the first but significant step to ensuring this future prosperity. Continued reliance on the core activities is unrealistic as it offers limited prospects for the long-term future of the company and their employees or an acceptable return to the State on its investment.</P>
    <P>The second option &mdash; total privatisation of the company &mdash; was not considered as suitable.   Such a course now could ensure that the Government would realise a short-term Exchequer benefit on its investment in Siúicre Éireann. However, the company would be particularly attractive to other EC companies which would anticipate maximising economies of scale and-or rationalisation.  A sale on that basis could have particularly negative effects on employment and on the future of beet growing in Ireland.  In addition, there would be no guarantee that any of the profits from future sugar operations would be invested in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the company on the basis of partial privatisation and commercial development while retaining a degree of control over their sugar operations and the sugar quota was the final option examined by the group.  This was examined in the context of what the group saw then as the future requirements of the company.</P>
    <P>They considered various possibilities for the commercial development of the company and concluded that they need to diversify and broaden their commercial base.  They took the view that such commercial development should be undertaken largely by means of acquisition and-or joint venture so as to minimise the risk for Siúicre Éireann. However, they recognised that while the development of the company cannot be financed solely from internal resources or by borrowing, the Exchequer should not be required to provide additional equity capital for development purposes.  They concluded that funding for development purposes would have to be partially obtained by way of additional equity and that this equity should be raised by the <Col N="801" /> issue of new shares on the stock market following flotation of the company.</P>
    <P>The group's recommendation, subsequently accepted by the Government, was to pursue the option of partial privatisation provided that it would be carried out in such a way as to afford reasonable safeguards for the Irish sugar industry, yield a reasonable return to the Exchequer and ensure as far as possible the future viability of the company.</P>
    <P>In reaching their decision the Government were mindful that partial privatisation would represent a fundamental change in the status of the company. However, they considered that the conditions which originally existed and justified exclusive State control no longer apply.  As indicated, the future success of Siúicre Éireann is dependent on their developing a dynamic and fully commercial approach to the conduct of the business in which they are engaged.</P>
    <P>Further commercial development of the company is unavoidable.  It is essential that they be in a position to avail of opportunities for growth and expansion that may emerge and be able to explore commercial sources of finance for such purposes.  It would not be either appropriate or practicable that the company should be dependent on the State for approval or finance.  Therefore, it is desirable to give the company access to equity from the capital markets by way of a flotation on the Stock Exchange.  In view of the size and profitability of the company and the potential for further improvements I am confident investors will welcome the opportunity to become involved with them, thereby contributing to their successful launch on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>I should stress &mdash; and the House will be aware &mdash; that the capital markets are a demanding taskmaster and investors demand high standards of performance from publicly quoted companies.  A track record of returns by way of dividend and capital appreciation of share values is essential if a company is to expect investors to put up funds for acquisitions and development.  Accordingly, once Siúicre <Col N="802" /> Éireann, or to be more correct their proposed holding company, Greenvale plc, is set up and floated on the Stock Exchange, they can expect to be subjected on a continual basis to detailed analysis by investing institutions and individuals.  Investors will continue to support the company and meet demands for injections of additional equity as long as they are delivering a satisfactory return on their investment.</P>
    <P>Already Siúicre Éireann are in the top flight of agri-business entities operating within the State with higher profits than any other company in the sector.  Furthermore, I am satisfied that they have the requisite ability to meet the demands of investors and, as a result of access to market funding, will develop in time into a very substantial food company.</P>
    <P>I am mindful of the fact that the employees and the suppliers of raw materials to the company, in particular beet growers, will be anxious to ascertain if the flotation will have significant implications for them.</P>
    <P>Neither workers nor suppliers have anything to fear from the flotation.  On the contrary, the overall strengthening of the financial base of the company arising from the flotation can be to their advantage only.  Beet growers and employees of course, will approach certain individual issues from a different perspective to that of the company.  There will always be negotiations on matters such as prices and wages.  However, in a growing and profitable company &mdash; such as I expect Greenvale to be &mdash; these matters should continue to be capable of resolution without particular difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is the Government intention that beet growers and employees will be asked to subscribe for shares in Greenvale.  I believe this is an important development. These groups, as shareholders, will have an active interest in the company and benefit from its development by way of dividends and the capital appreciation of their holdings.  The terms on which shares will be made available to beet growers and employees will be discussed with the two parties involved.</P>
    <P>One point on which concern has been <Col N="803" /> expressed since the publication of the Bill is that of the rights of employees following flotation.  The position is that workers' interests are already protected under the European Communities &mdash; safeguarding of employees' rights on transfer of undertaking &mdash; Regulations, 1980.  However, in order to reassure workers on this point I intend moving, on Committee Stage, an amendment underlining the rights of employees.  This will provide specifically that the rights which employees of Siúicre Éireann or its subsidiaries hold before the date on which the Minister for Finance transfers his shares in Siúicre Éireann to the new holding company will continue to be held by them on and from that transfer date. Provision will also be made to ensure that employees will not suffer any less favourable terms under their pension or superannuation schemes after that transfer date.</P>
    <P>In addition, I should add that Siúicre Éireann has indicated to ICTU a willingness to confirm formally a number of commitments, in writing, relating to employees' conditions subsequent to the restructuring of the company.  These commitments are as follows: no interruption in continuity of employment; current rates of pay and conditions of employment will continue to apply; continued recognition of existing trade unions; and existing procedures for determining rates of pay and conditions of employment, including redundancy terms, will continue to apply.  The company are willing to register these commitments in the Labour Court and with the new Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>I would now like to make some comments on the food industry.  While Siúicre Éireann, with a turnover of £271 million in the year to September 1990 and over 1,700 employees, is a substantial company in Irish terms, it is quite small by international standards.  It is generally accepted that for companies to be viable and internationally competitive in the agri-food business in the long term, they must be of a size which is somewhat greater than Siúicre Éireann as presently constituted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> Given my responsibility for the food industry and its relevance to the future of Siúicre Éireann I would like to take the opportunity to speak in particular about the challenges posed by 1992 for Irish food companies.  The future offers the prospect of a general restructuring of the food industry in Europe.  There are likely to be an increased number of mergers and acquisitions which in turn should result in lower costs and greatly increased competition.  In considering the size of the resultant big EC companies one must remember that they in turn will be smaller than some of their competitors on the world food stage.</P>
    <P>Irish food companies will never be as big as the giant European and US companies. However, that does not mean that they cannot succeed in the Europe of the future.  There will be plenty of room for relatively small companies, even though they will have to be large in Irish terms as presently understood.  The companies that succeed will be those that recognise that the different elements of the European market will no longer be self contained but will be interacting with each other.  It can be expected that customer tastes and preference will begin to overflow country boundaries while prices will be increasingly affected by European rather than local considerations.</P>
    <P>While the small scale of Irish food companies is a disadvantage, their ability to source high quality raw materials at a relatively low cost is a major advantage. Siúicre Éireann have in recent years displayed abilities which should stand them well in their drive to become a successful food company in the nineties. They have been successful with branded sugar products in Ireland while Odlums is a household name.  Developing international brands is an expensive and difficult process.  The larger Irish food companies are conscious that apart from the brand route which can be so difficult there are substantial opportunities in Europe for trading directly with other companies.</P>
    <P>Sale to other manufacturers, own-label production, joint ventures and supplying the catering industry are but a few <Col N="805" /> examples of the opportunities that exist. Siúicre Éireann have developed markets with other manufacturers for sugar with some considerable skill and are well placed to use this experience in pursuing new developments in Europe over the coming years.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the particular provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 is the standard definitions section and requires no specific comment.</P>
    <P>Section 2 allows the Minister for Finance to exchange his shares in Siúicre Éireann for shares in the new holding company which as I mentioned earlier, is to be called Greenvale plc.  It also enables the Minister for Finance to acquire further shares in the holding company with the required funds being advanced from the Central Fund.  He may also, following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food sell or dispose of shares in the holding company as he sees fit. Funds received in respect of share sales and dividends must be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>This section also allows the Minister for Agriculture and Food to acquire a special share in the holding company. This share is analogous to the &ldquo;Golden Share&rdquo; issued in privatisations in other European countries in recent years, notably in the UK and France.  The purpose of the special share is to ensure that the State can effectively exercise certain specified control over the sugar operations of the company while reducing its own shareholding below 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The special share is designed principally to ensure that none of the following events can arise without the prior consent in writing of the special shareholder: any change in certain specified articles in the Articles of Association of the company; the winding up of the company; the sale of more than 49 per cent of Siúicre Éireann which, following the Stock Exchange flotation, will be a subsidiary company of Greenvale plc; the disposal of specified sugar assets including the Irish sugar quota held by Siúicre Éireann; the creation of a new class of shares in the company; and the <Col N="806" /> building up by one shareholder or a consortium of shareholders, other than the Minister for Finance, of more than a 15 per cent shareholding in the company after flotation.  The above points are dealt with in some detail in the Articles of Association of Greenvale.</P>
    <P>I should mention at this stage that it is the intention of the Government that the Minister for Finance will only dispose of sufficient shares on flotation to bring his holding down to 45 per cent.</P>
    <P>In conclusion on the special share, I could summarise it as being a device to prevent the disposal of the controlling interest in Siúicre Éireann or the sugar assets and to prevent a shareholder or group of shareholders acting together from gaining control of Greenvale.</P>
    <P>A further provision in section 2, which I should mention, is that enabling the Minister for Finance following consultations with the Minister for Agriculture and Food to sell or dispose of his shares to such specified persons and on such terms and conditions as he may prescribe by regulation.  The intention of this section is to facilitate the sale of shares to employees and beet growers.</P>
    <P>It is as I indicated earlier, the intention of the Government to encourage the employees and beet growers to invest in Greenvale and to this end the Minister for Finance will dispose of some of his shareholding to these groups or alternatively new shares may be issued to them.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the two ministerial shareholders may exercise all their rights attaching to the shares in the holding company, which is Greenvale, including, where applicable, the exercise of those rights by attorney or proxy.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the allotment of shares and empowers the two ministerial shareholders to appoint nominees and to transfer shares to such nominees to act on their behalf.  The section sets out the rights and duties of nominees and the power of the Minister to issue directions.</P>
    <P>Section 5 grants relief from stamp duty on any agreement, transfer, conveyance, assignment or lease whereby any business, assets or liabilities of Siúicre <Col N="807" /> Éireann, or shares held by them are transferred to the holding company.  This relief is a common feature of group reconstructions.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the repeal of the Sugar Manufacture Acts while section 7 is a standard provision relating to any expenses arising under the Act.  Section 8 is another standard provision and deals with the laying of orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This provides for the orders to apply immediately but states that they may be annulled by either House within 21 sitting days.  Section 9 contains the usual citation and commencement provisions.  The Act will come into operation on such day or days as the Minister for Finance may determine following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>Deputies will understand that I felt obliged to speak at some length on the Bill.  It is important legislation and it was necessary to explain the background and the need for changes in some detail.  I am sure that Deputies will respond in a positive manner.  I will deal with any specific points raised in my reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>We will not be opposing or impeding this Bill, but we may question some aspects of it.  We obviously welcome the general thrust of the Bill since it could be said that we initiated it.  The Minister was not at all apologetic in the course of his statement.  If the Bill had been brought before the House three years ago the Minister would have been duty bound to vote with The Workers' Party in opposing it.  At that time he was vehement in his opposition to the rationalisation of the Sugar Company. The Workers' Party and Fianna Fáil are the two parties of humbug and hypocrisy, as a former colleague of mine might have said.</P>

      <P>If you want humbug you will get it in the midst of the two of them. The Minister probably would have had <Col N="808" /> no option but to vote with The Workers' Party because he was hell bent on not allowing the Sugar Company to become a viable financial entity.  With the passing of this Bill the company will have the opportunity to make a considerable amount of money for the State, allowing that money to be reinvested in other projects. I see setting up Greenvale plc as the start of something special in the processing facilities for Irish agriculture, particularly in regard to vegetables.  It could be the springboard for fantastic developments of the type we have spoken about for many years but never achieved. With the money raised on the Stock Exchange we should be in a position to provide further processing of a whole range of vegetables.  We should be able to broaden the base of the Sugar Company and increase its turnover from £250 million to £1 billion, with the foresight and imagination which is there at present.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his election literature in 1987 made the point that if Fianna Fáil got back into office the board of the Sugar Company would be replaced.  I am glad that the two mainstays of that board are still there, namely, the chairman, Mr. Cahill, and the chief executive, Mr. Comerford.  They have called the shots and turned the company around.  The Minister did not get his way.  There were some minor changes in the membership of the board but the brainbox stayed where it was, the people with the backbone and the gumption to pursue forward-looking policies stayed at the helm.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party, far <Col N="809" /> from being the party who promote the welfare of workers, should be renamed the anti-workers' party.  They seem intent on destroying companies which provide employment.  I have seen it in my constituency and others and in the amendment put forward today by The Workers' Party.  Their long-term aim is to destroy jobs, not to create them.  One needs money to create jobs and by raising money through such a company as Greenvale there will be the wherewithal to invest and create new jobs.  That does not appeal to The Workers' Party.  They would like to think in terms of minimum numbers in employment in the Sugar Company and its subsidiary industries.</P>
      <P>Some ten or 12 years ago employment in the Sugar Company was 2,400.  When the necessary rationalisation took place the number fell to 1,200.  Today it has risen to 1,700 and is increasing rapidly. With the public floating of the company and the injection of capital, not only will we see a turnover which will be a multiple of the £250 million obtained in 1989 but probably a similar multiple in the numbers employed.  I look forward to an industry involving the processing of sugar beet and vegetables and grain milling, such as the Minch Norton operation, which would employ 5,000 or 6,000 people.  The Minister in his reply might refer to that aspect in some detail.  This is the best opportunity of achieving what we have been promising to do since the foundation of the State.  Let us build on it.  We have the right people at the top in the Sugar Company and I hope they will also be at the top in the new company, Greenvale plc.  It is important to retain those people.</P>
      <P>I must rebuke the Minister for what I can only call a typical exercise in gombeen politics, his personal manifesto to the people of Thurles in North Tipperary in 1987.  I refer specifically to the document circulated on 9 February 1987 relating to the future of the Thurles sugar factory.  This is the type of document which brings politics and politicians into serious disrepute.  It is the type of document which, if implemented, would keep us in the dark ages in industrial terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> The document states that where the Government talk of closing Thurles, Fianna Fáil plan for development.  It goes on to state that the Coalition Government and the present board of the CSE talk of closing down the Thurles sugar factory.  It urges people to change the Government so that Fianna Fáil can change the board.  In the meantime, the document states, Fianna Fáil will insist that the present board review their so-called two factory plan.  It is a good job the Minister did not get his way and that the board did not reconsider the two factory plan.  The two factory plan has brought the sugar factory into profitability.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Taoiseach, I do not know if he has a ruler in the Cabinet, but he rapped the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the knuckles and told him to forget about his three factory plan because it was going to be a two factory operation.  Perhaps it is a bit rough on the Minister but he invited it.  He chided the record of the Coalition Government for closing various elements of the Sugar Company, including Tuam.  We grasped the nettle and we attracted political odium for doing so.  It seemed that the whole west of Ireland would go against us but nevertheless we did it, and it did a lot of good for the Sugar Company. If the Minister had been a little more forthcoming in agreeing to a quick closure of the Thurles factory we could have had Greenvale plc floated two years ago and we would have been on the way to establishing and sustaining a huge vegetable processing industry here.  Because of the Minister's opposition we are probably two years behind the times in doing this and in the process have probably lost about £100 million.</P>
    <P>One of the things I am aggrieved about is that I read more about this Bill in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Business Post</i> than I did in the Bill itself or in the explanatory memorandum.  We are used to getting very enlightening memoranda.  The parliamentary draftsmen draw up legalistic Bills which are difficult for the layman to understand.  Here, however, the memorandum is not a whole lot <Col N="811" /> better.  The type of information one would expect in a memorandum was not in the memorandum. It was in the <i>Sunday Business Post.</i> They point out a fact of life which is rather unfortunate.  They say that because of the economic climate at the moment, because of the weakness on the Stock Exchange, the value of the Sugar Company now, instead of being £200 million is only approximately £140 million and that cannot be helped; that one always imagines one is in the very worst situation but that, however, might not be the case and the market might get even worse.  If that commentary on the value of the Sugar Company is correct, it is unfortunate that the placement was not made two years ago when the market was so buoyant.  It was not made because of the Minister's resistence and his determination to defend the indefensible.</P>
    <P>There is something that is somewhat puzzling about the Bill.  The Sugar Company, as we know it, is at present owned by the Minister for Finance who is the main shareholder.  As well as that the Minister for Finance will be a 45 per cent shareholder in the new holding company, Greenvale.  He can sell those shares off as time goes on if the company are operating as we anticipate.  Why does the Minister for Finance have to own the Sugar Company as he did in the past?  Why does he have to own 45 per cent of the shares in the new company, Greenvale, when really it is the responsibility of the Minister and the Department of Agriculture? The Minister for Agriculture appoints the chairman and the members of the board. When there are problems in the Sugar Company the Minister for Agriculture is the person to whom the board refer.  I cannot understand why the shares have to be vested in the Minister for Finance. My advice to the Minister &mdash; I have probably given him this advice before in regard to other aspects of the Department of Agriculture &mdash; is to wean away the property which rightly belongs to the Department of Agriculture from the Department of Finance as quickly as he can because they are about the most inhibiting force I know in this State when <Col N="812" /> it comes to development.  They will chop the Minister right, left and centre and if this company have the good fortune to make a lot of money or more money than is anticipated, they will grab it and it will not go for the betterment of the new company, agriculture, farmers or the workers involved in the company in Ireland.  The Minister will have to fight tooth and nail.  It is about time a marker was put down, that Ministers got a lobby going in the Cabinet to see that something that was within their portfolio is controlled by them and not by the Department of Finance.  As a former Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture should be well able to untangle that particular web.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>He is still the main shareholder, which means he calls the tune.  It is all about money.  I would not say the Minister was converted on the road to Damascus.  I would say he had to be hauled up that road from Thurles to Saint Stephen's Green bawling and shouting the whole way.  I would not say the Minister was actually spread all over the Cabinet table but I would say the threat was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to cost competitiveness and tough decisions.  Those decisions were taken back in 1983, 1984 and 1985.  I am glad to see that the present Government had the bigness of mind, the courage and the wisdom to reappoint Mr. Cahill as the chairman of the company because he showed that he could get things done and that is essential.  He had the courage and the backbone more than anything else, and ability is inherent in <Col N="813" /> people like that.  He had the right ingredients and I am glad to see that he was reappointed.</P>
    <P>There was a major part for Minister Kirk to play in this new board because it is a springboard for what he has been trying so hard and so fruitlessly to do for the past four years, if he will excuse the pun, that is, to start up a viable vegetable processing industry in this country not just to grow vegetables but to process and have them available for 12 months of the year so that we would not have to depend for our vegetables in the first six months of the year on the British, on Northern Ireland producers, on the Danes and particularly on the Dutch.  If the home grown produce cannot be retained fresh it should be processed so that we can avail of them.</P>
    <P>I note that the Sugar Company have acquired not just 50 per cent of Odlums and have an option on the remaining 50 per cent but have also acquired companies such as Grassland and Swiss Co and that they have a certain interest, although it is only academic at the moment, in companies like Minch Norton.  The Sugar Company must expand their activities and that will probably mean doing what the major co-operatives in this country, such as Avonmore and Waterford, have already done, that is, acquire complementary industries in Britain and America and probably on mainland Europe because the processing of 200,000 tonnes of sugar is in itself a very restricted activity.  While it may now be a profitable activity, that may not always be the case.  Take, for instance, the GATT negotiations presently drawing to a conclusion with, we hope, not too hurtful a result for this country.</P>
    <P>It is quite likely that, if not immediately then with the passing of time, Third World countries will produce enough cane sugar to seriously erode the price structure of sugar extracted from sugar beet in this country.  It may well happen that there will be a free world market and prices will be held at a reasonably high level as far as Third World countries are concerned, but not as far as we are concerned and there could be a serious <Col N="814" /> undermining of our position as a result of the sale price of sugar.  That is what may happen in the years ahead, although it may not be too many years ahead. Perhaps the World Bank will invest on a massive scale in the Caribbean and Pacific islands which will allow them to produce significant quantities of relatively cheap sugar which we will not be able to keep out of our market.</P>
    <P>The protectionist system in which the EC has wallowed for the past 25 years is beginning to crumble.  However, we would hope that we could get derogations and exemptions from the effects of a dilution of the protectionist system.  In the event that we would not be as successful as we would hope, it is imperative that we would have fall-back positions. The Sugar Company must diversify and, most likely, diversification will not be limited to Ireland; it should involve Britain, the United States and western Europe and there should be a wide range of food industries so that we have other methods of raising profits that are vitally necessary for survival.</P>
    <P>The base is too narrow at present, although I compliment the present board and management of the Sugar Company for having broadened that base and, in particular, for having the courage to close down the unprofitable elements of their business and having bought in profitable elements.  I think the Minister has not given them credit where credit is due. This is the first opportunity we have had to say that in this House.  We should not be afraid to take on people who have nothing better to suggest than dead end, useless solutions &mdash; they are not solutions, that is the wrong word; they should be called &ldquo;ideologies&rdquo;.  These are idiotic ideologies suggested by people who have nothing better to say.  Let us give credit where credit is due.  Let us support the people who have shown the inventiveness and innovation which are so badly needed in this country.  Let us hope that this trend grows and spreads. Let us hope that the Minister is appreciative of their efforts and that the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, is fully occupied <Col N="815" /> in drawing up plans with the Sugar Company to develop the home industry while the Sugar Company concern themselves with acquiring industries at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see in the Minister's statement that the unions are quite happy that the employment of the present employees is being safeguarded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement, the Minister says that written commitments are being given to the ICTU, and that seems to be a reasonable accommodation.  I could not see why the unions would be objecting when job opportunities have been expanded and are due to be expanded further.  If the company benefit to the tune of £40 to £50 million from the flotation of their company shares on the Stock Exchange, that will mean more jobs.  How could any trade unionist in his right mind object to that?  The essence of what employment is all about is job expansion and job creation.  I hope the safeguards referred to in the Minister's statement are acceptable.  In my day I dealt with people in the unions representing the food industry who were extremely reasonable, particularly those involved with the Sugar Company and the food industry generally.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister is retaining a special share, &ldquo;a golden share for a golden boy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes we are nice, but not always.  It is nice to be nice.  I believe it is called a golden share in England and France, however I am not convinced &mdash; in fact, nobody can be convinced &mdash; in these days of High Court and Supreme Court challenges and challenges in the European Court that the validity of the &ldquo;golden&rdquo; or special share will survive forever. This is worrying.  It is a supposed right of a government to stop industry from another country buying an industry <Col N="816" /> within the State, and that the industry can be safeguarded by this golden or special share.  I think that in time to come senior counsels in Ireland and elsewhere will have a field day arguing that case in the European Court.  I hope that will not happen, but it is a worrying aspect.  With the advent of 1992 and the open market, that concept could be challenged and it would be very worrying if it was challenged.</P>
      <P>The thought of any part of our 200,000 tonne sugar quota moving out of the country is too dreadful to entertain.  We have already seen our tillage farmers in the grain sector threatened with annihilation if the proposals put forward by Commissioner MacSharry last week come to fruition; there will be no place for tillage farmers in this country if they are expected to grow grain for £75 a tonne.  It just cannot be done.  If we cannot quote a national vital interest in a case like this, that section of our agricultural industry will go to the four winds and it will be destroyed.  We must be very careful that our sugar quota is maintained. I am not a senior counsel, however I think the Minister is a junior counsel and knows the vagaries of the law, but one can never be quite sure how a decision will go.</P>
      <P>At present we have 5,000 farmers farming 82,000 acres who primarily depend on sugar beet for a living.  It is a reasonably well paying activity, particularly in comparison with grain growing. For tillage farmers who are involved in both &mdash; and most tillage farmers are &mdash; sugar beet growing is the mainstay of their enterprise.  It will certainly be the mainstay of the enterprise if Commissioner MacSharry's proposals come to fruition even in a diluted form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers have indicated to me that they are worried about the manner in which they are being paid for their sugar beet. They feel they should be getting more, not just a price increase because of the improved extraction of sugar from the sugar beet crop due to new improved technology in recent years which increases the value of the sugar beet crop by something in the order of £6.5 million. <Col N="817" /> Basically the methods have improved so much that more sugar can be extracted from the sugar beet and not only the sugar beet but what was traditionally referred to as the crown, the part that is snagged off by hand.</P>
    <P>Nowadays sugar can be extracted from the crown area which was not extractable in years gone by.  Because of the improved method of extracting sugar from the main body of the sugar beet and the sugar which is extracted from the crown &mdash; which previously was disposed of &mdash; the value of the sugar from both those extra extraction methods is worth £6.5 million to the industry in this country.  The 5,000 farmers who are supplying the sugar beet company are asking that they be given some of this money, not all of it.  I think Deputy Sherlock has a much better working knowledge of this aspect, although in our younger days many of us weeded, thinned, snagged and piped beet, not a very pleasant task in freezing wet miserable winter days.  The improved extraction methods mean that £6.5 million extra is now being made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In five or six years time there will be no such thing as beet growing in this country.  The Deputy knows that but he is not prepared to admit it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know from what source the Deputy gets his information. We will safeguard that 200,000 tonnes of sugar whether in government or out of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will maintain it or we will support the Government to maintain it.  If the Deputy had his way there would be no sugar company because it would be bankrupt; they were so much in debt as a result of his methods.  The growers are merely asking for £2.5 million of that £6.5 million.  We will go back to the big villain of the piece &mdash; the Department of Finance and not the Department of <Col N="818" /> Agriculture and Food.  They are insisting that all the extra moneys which are being obtained by the improved methods of extraction be retained by the Sugar Company.  I believe the Minister and the Department of Agriculture and Food might be easier to deal with if they were allowed to carry out the negotiations with the beet growers.  I believe we are seeing the hand of the Department of Finance in this instance.</P>
      <P>It is not unreasonable for the growers to request a portion of the £6.5 million which has come about as a result of improved technology.  That is the point I am making.  I ask the Minister to give us his views on that element when replying because it is a burning issue and I feel the growers have a point.  They are seeking only a proportion of the extra moneys being made available.</P>
      <P>There are some nice nicknames in this new legislation.  The golden share is referred to as ghost beet in the industry. It was not there previously &mdash; now you see it, now you do not &mdash; but it is there and it is worth £6.5 million.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten me as to why, at the most recent meeting of the Council of Ministers of Agriculture, the sugar regulation was renewed only for a two year period whereas traditionally that regulation was renewed for a five year period.  Is there some peculiar reason why the regulation was renewed only for such a limited period when it was normally renewed for five years?</P>
      <P>I would like if people in The Workers' Party, such as Deputy Sherlock and others, and some of the Independent Members who have objections to this Bill would bear in mind an interesting development.  Five years ago when I was Minister the Sugar Company was in considerable disarray.  From 1982 to 1987 &mdash; and Deputy Kavanagh will be aware of this &mdash; we gave equity to the Sugar Company of £59 million which effectively bailed them out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on condition that the company became a viable entity, which <Col N="819" /> it did.  What was happening at that time was that the French sugar processors were moving into this country and underselling us on our own markets.  They could do it because of the inefficiency of our sugar plants and our Sugar Company generally.  Had we not acted in the early and mid-eighties there might not be a sugar industry in this country because under the laws of the EC we could not prevent that sugar from coming in.  The only reason the Sugar Company has been maintained as a viable entity is that we are able to sell sugar as cheaply as anybody else within the EC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We were able to sell it because we got a board who were able to rationalise the Sugar Company with the aid of finance from the Government. That enabled our sugar to be as competitive as sugar in the EC.  Do not let anybody forget that.  You can have your stupid ideas and ideologies about over-manning and employing three times or four times as many people as are necessary but you cannot survive on a free market or an open market with that type of codology.  It is about time the public of this country &mdash; and most do &mdash; recognised that you cannot operate with outdated systems.</P>
      <P>As I stated at the outset, we support the Bill.  We wish the new company good fortune because we believe it will be the beginning of something new and very good for the horticulture industry, the tillage farmers, the workers and the economy of this country.  While I may have had some harsh words to say about the Minister's original reluctance to get the show on the road, he has come right in the end and we wish him the best of luck in putting this project through.</P>

      <P>The first day of this session will be remembered for the debate on the budget and not for the debate on this Bill which deals with the <Col N="820" /> privatisation of the Sugar Company. Those of us who are not as familiar with the agricultural industry as others must wonder why we are discussing this Bill at a time when there are serious problems in the agricultural industry but no proposals are being put forward to help those who are suffering.</P>
      <P>It seems strange to me and I believe, to most farmers that, having experienced one of the worst winters ever, having heard the news from Brussels about the reformation of the CAP under an Irish Commissioner and the problems we face in the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations, we are dealing here with an industry which has produced excellent results over the past two or three years. I had hoped that the Government would provide time for an urgent debate on all the problems in the agricultural industry, The Minister could have come here today and given hope to the very important and essential group of people in that industry who are depressed and demoralised and believe the Government do not have any interest in their problems.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance will show some concern for the people in this basic industry when he makes his budget speech today.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to hand over a very large proportion of one of our most important and spectacular industries, the Sugar Company, to the private sector.  I believe this proposal is a long way down the list of concerns of most people.  I say that because I do not think he has responded to the problems being experienced by those in the agricultural sector in the past six months or so.  As I said, the agricultural community are demoralised as a result of the bad weather, flooding and other problems to which I referred and I hoped the Minister would avail of this opportunity today to give hope to that community for the remainder of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious from the remarks made by Deputy Deasy that this Bill will be given a Second Reading as both the Government and the main Opposition party support it.  The Workers' Party tried to prevent the Second Reading of this Bill by calling for a vote on the Order for <Col N="821" /> Second Stage.  Because the Whips from all parties had agreed to the debate taking place today, the Labour Party could not support The Workers' Party gimmick which was done perhaps for publicity. We should use this debate to amplify our concerns&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Workers' Party seem to have increased their level of support, but our support has been progressively increasing since the last general election.  We should debate the merits of the Bill and give our opinions on it rather than try to stultify it at birth, so to speak.  We could not support The Workers' Party proposal this morning as we would much prefer to hear the Minister's views on our concerns about the Bill.</P>
      <P>We will be opposing the Second Reading of the Bill as we have very genuine concerns about the provisions in it.  The Minister did not address these concerns in his speech but perhaps he will do so when he is concluding the debate.  We cannot support the Bill as it stands at present as it will give rise to concern in three areas &mdash; our quota for sugar, the workers in the industry and the producers. I believe the consumers, who are the other element in this issue, are satisfied at the way in which the Sugar Company have done their job.  During my contribution I want to point out to the Minister our genuine concerns about the provisions in the Bill in regard to these three areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sugar Company have a very proud history.  They were, to use the operative word today, a jewel in the crown in the semi-State sector.  General Costello, who has been given great credit for setting up the sugar industry to ensure that beet producers would have a viable industry, <Col N="822" /> has rightly been listed as one of the managers who took over a semi-State company and made a great success of it. Perhaps the work done by him will be undone by this Bill.  I know that times change and different business attitudes are adopted in every area.  I am not saying everything that happened was right and that things should not change, but it is only right that we should consider the advantages and disadvantages which may result through a major change in one of the jewels in the crown of the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>The great asset of this company is its 200,000 tonne EC sugar quota.  This has made the company attractive to other businesses both in Ireland and abroad. Companies have made attempts over the past two years to get their hands on this quota.  Because this company is of such concern to us and because its importance to the economy generally, reference has been made to it in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Even though it is only dealt with summarily in the programme &mdash; five lines &mdash; nevertheless it is referred to.  The programme states:</P>
    <P>The vesting in the Minister for Agriculture and Food of the special share in the holding company to be established for the Stock Exchange flotation will ensure, <i>inter alia</i>, that the retention of the sugar quota in Ireland is safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The Government will undertake to agree terms with the Company to protect the present representational arrangements regarding quota distribution. </P>
    <P>At least we know the priorities of the Government in this area.  They, obviously, wish to sell off a large part of this company to the private sector.  They hope the Bill will ensure that the quota is retained here and this special share, the golden share, is the method by which that will be achieved.</P>
    <P>It is strange that in those five lines of that document there is no word about the concerns of the workers or the producers in this industry.  The Minister adverted to <Col N="823" /> this in his speech on Second Stage, but nevertheless, our party are concerned about the privatisation of the company. There seems to be an attitude here that everything that is operated by the public sector is wrong.  A number of right wing economists seem to indicate that every company the State built up over many years should be sold to the private sector who can better operate them, but I do not agree.  There are many valuable companies operating very well in the public sector that should not be privatised, but the Government have apparently, in more than one area, taken on the mantle of the Thatcher approach to the public sector and seized the opportunity to raise money by selling off the assets of public companies.</P>
    <P>This is a far cry from the stated position of the Taoiseach when he was Leader of the Opposition only a few years ago.  On 20 January 1987 &mdash; almost four years ago to the day &mdash; the Taoiseach wrote to Mr. Peter Cassells, then assistant secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who in various media contributions expressed his concern on behalf of workers for their continuation in the public sector and the likelihood of changes at that time.  He sought the opinion of the Fianna Fáil Opposition who were a little ambivalent in this area.  At that time Deputy Haughey wrote to Mr. Cassells &mdash; one can get the sense of his feeling at the time from this letter &mdash; stating he saw some comments in print about Fianna Fáil's position in regard to semi-State companies. He wished to point out that shortly prior to Christmas &mdash; this refers to 1987 when Fine Gael were in power on their own &mdash; a motion was put down in Dáil Éireann by Fianna Fáil which read:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its support for an efficient and effective semi-State sector as a major instrument of economic development and the provision of employment, and deplores recent Government statements to the contrary. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> The letter went on to state:</P>
    <P>As you will be well aware, the record of Fianna Fáil, whether in Government or Opposition, has been one of consistent support for our State bodies, most of which were created under Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>I have on many occasions made my views known on privatisation.  For example, in the Adjournment debate of 14 December 1984 I stated: &ldquo;To close down, sell off or devalue a State company seems to have been turned to by the economists and other spokesmen for the New Right as a demonstration of political virility....  If this process of dismantling the State sector is brought much further, the Government&mdash;</P>
    <P>it was not a Fianna Fáil Government at the time</P>
    <P>&mdash;will get to the point of dismantling the State itself&rdquo;.  But I can assure you that Fianna Fáil has no intention of privatising established State bodies such as Aer Lingus, Bord na Mona, CIE or any other commercial semi-State body.</P>
    <P>With best wishes,</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Charles J. Haughey, T.D.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach still has a very strong hold on his Coalition Government and would have a big influence in the policies they adopt.  There is a question to be answered by the Taoiseach as to when he decided to change from his total support, as he said in 1987, for the continuation of the semi-State industries as public companies to his new way forward &mdash; that term was used in a document in the past &mdash; to privatise or sell off the family silver to get a few bob in the coffers.</P>
    <P>This matter is relevant on budget day and it will be clearer to us as the hours go by.  The Fianna Fáil Party did a U-turn and changed course in the past four years.  They were in Opposition in 1987 but now that they are in Government the position is different.  We all know that Fianna Fáil have changed course in other <Col N="825" /> areas.  In 1985 they won the local elections hands down by saying they were going to do away with service charges, but instead they were increased from something like £20 in in my constituency to £160 now.  That U-turn seems to have been forgotten.</P>
    <P>It never bothered Fianna Fáil to state their principles and then do a U-turn.  In this debate we are dealing, as I said, with one of the companies that has been the jewel in the crown of semi-State companies. When we were in government with Fine Gael we encountered problems as regards the industry which was going through a very difficult patch.  We had to face opposition inside and outside the House to the actions we took in order to put the company on their feet.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation which took place involving the closure of the Tuam sugar factory was most unpopular within the trade union movement and with the people of the area.  Indeed, the Fianna Fáil Opposition at the time made the most of it.  As a result of those actions, and with the determined leadership in the Sugar Company &mdash; I do not doubt that they support what is in the Bill &mdash; the company have been making a profit for the past three years.  In 1988 the company made £12 million and in 1990 they made £15 million.  Yet we are told by the Minister that in order that the company may progress, expand and prosper they must be privatised, but I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>I remember when in Government an industry based in my constituency &mdash; they also had a base in Cork &mdash; the old NET company, were experiencing serious difficulties because of the change in trade and the importation of cheap fertiliser.  The solution on that occasion was not to sell off the company, because nobody was interested in them, they were not making a profit, but the Government looked for a joint venture operation which rescued the company.  That option was still open to the Government and could have been used &mdash; as a fourth option &mdash; and put forward to the specialists who looked at this industry and made recommendations to the Government.  I do not know why it was not submitted as a fourth option to <Col N="826" /> be thoroughly investigated by specialists as is the case in regard to every problem which the Government face.  If the recommendation was favourable it could have been accepted and if not it could have been buried in the file and the dust allowed to settle on it.  It was a successful option in the case of some of our semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>This Bill raises many queries which have not been answered in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council was established by the Government in November, 1973 as a forum in <Col N="829" /> which the Government and the social partners discuss the principles relating to the efficient development of the national economy and the achievement of social justice and advise the Government, through the Taoiseach, on their application.  The constitution and terms of reference of the council were established by the Government in consultation with the social partners and can be altered by the same procedure.  The membership of the council was revised in 1989 to provide for six Government nominees, one being from the National Youth Council of Ireland.  Previously there were five Government nominees, of whom two were from the National Youth Council.  The three Secretaries of Departments attend by right of the office held and are not Government nominees.</P>
    <P>The term of office of all current members who are appointed for five years will expire on 16 November 1994.  The Government and the social partners agreed in 1989, because of the importance of the European Community dimension for the council's deliberations, that an observer from the European Commission nominated by President Delors could attend council meetings as an observer.  There is nothing in the constitution of the council to prevent this arrangement and the council, as a matter of practice, have on occasions invited experts to council meetings.</P>
    <P>The council is not a political forum. The value of its views and reports is greatly enhanced because they are of a non-political nature.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, that party political representatives, as suggested by the Deputy, should participate in it.  The role of political representatives arises when the reports of the council are laid before each House of the Oireachtas and published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that the material in the NESC documents, including in particular the strategy for the nineties, played a large part in creating the basis upon which the Government were able to produce <Col N="830" /> the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress?</i> In view of the fact that the policy commitments in that document are ones in respect of which, ultimately, Dáil Éireann must make a decision and in view of the concern to have a national consensus, will the Taoiseach agree that it would be appropriate to find a mechanism whereby elected representatives, other than office holders, would have some opportunity to have an input to the discussions in the NESC, either as full members or, if not, as observers?  If that is not the case we will have a situation in which Dáil Éireann will be presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> negotiated outside this House with the social partners in respect of which the Dáil will have no option but to accept or reject <i>in toto</i> whatever proposal is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not say that the Deputy is confusing but he is merging two things.  I am firmly convinced that it would not be desirable to have participation in the work and reports of the NESC by Members of this House or others.  It is a carefully constructed economic and social forum which has worked well.  Its value largely derives from the fact that it does not have any political character or input; it is simply a forum whereby the different elements in the social and economic structures of our society can come together and arrive, as far as possible, at agreed views and opinions and report thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point Deputy Bruton made related to the national programme. Again, that is something which was worked out in the normal way with the social partners.  It was negotiated, discussed, amended and finally produced in its present form.  It is the intention to bring that programme before the Dáil, to have it fully debated and approved or disapproved as the Dáil thinks fit.  I think that is the best, most feasible and most constructive way of proceeding.  With regard to the NESC reports, we have debated in the House one of the major reports in connection with the European Community.  As I see it, the proper <Col N="831" /> procedure is to have all these matters considered in a non-political forum and then have the reports discussed here in this political context.  With regard to the programme itself, if the Deputies opposite wish, we could perhaps agree to discuss the NESC report on strategies for the nineties and the national programme together and have a vote on the programme as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that in most other countries where consensus economic policies are pursued &mdash; it is desirable that one should have consensus as far as possible &mdash; specific arrangements exist to involve parliament in the building of consensus? Would he agree that it is not desirable, from the point of view of the sovereignty of parliament, that parliament should be presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> which has been agreed outside this House in respect of which we would have no choice but to either accept it <i>in toto</i> or reject it <i>in toto?</i> Would he agree, if he wants a genuine consensus not just involving the social partners but the best available democratic input, that some mechanism must be found to involve parliament prior to the finalisation of the programme either through the NESC or some other mechanism? Would he not agree that that is the pattern in most other countries where consensus policies are pursued?  May I ask the Taoiseach one other specific question as five questions are being taken together?  Why has he reduced the representation of the National Youth Council, from two members to one, in view of the very large number of young people, many of whom have to emigrate, who ought to have representation on the NESC and should not see their representation being cut in half as seems to have happened in the recent revision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the place to secure political consensus is here.  The position now is that we have secured economic and social consensus between the Government and the social partners. It now remains for us when we debate <Col N="832" /> the programme to see if we can achieve political consensus here.  There is no other feasible way of doing it.  I would like to remind Deputy Bruton that we discussed this several times during the course of the negotiations.  Not only would it not be feasible but it would be totally impractical to endeavour to have political input into the negotiations on the programme.  I am sure the Deputy understands that it is complex enough as it is to secure agreement between the trade unions, the employers, the farmers and the Government.  That is a multifaceted process.  If we were to attempt to bring in to that process the additional political dimension the thing would become quite impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of the representation of the National Youth Council on the NESC, again we have discussed that matter <i>ad nauseam</i> here and I have explained exactly what the position was.  There are a number of very important bodies which have only one representative on the NESC.  That works perfectly satisfactorily. The National Youth Council had two representatives but the normal practice was that only one of the representatives attended.  In fact I do not believe that the two ever attended together but they are in no way deprived from giving full expression to their opinions by having one representative as have these other major and important bodies.  The National Youth Council have the right to have an alternate.  If the nominated person cannot be there the alternate can be but, as I said, we have been over this ground again and again and I have explained the position.  I believe it is working quite satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the points raised by the Leader of the Opposition are valid in that, if we are to have consensus and a ten year plan, as envisaged in the Irish Congress of Trade Union's document and indeed in the programme, that this <Col N="833" /> necessarily involves the alternative government and that in order to copperfasten this approach there is a need to involve the Opposition parties at an earlier stage and in a more meaningful way than is envisaged?  Would he also not agree that there is a danger that this new form of consensus between the Government and the social partners could lead to what was described in <i>The Irish Times</i> as a Fifth Estate or, in other words, a third House of Parliament which would be more influential than the elected Houses of Parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would reject that completely; there is no merit in that argument. What is happening is a process that happens over and over again in many other areas.  First, the people involved sit down and come up with an agreement which is hammered out between them. That agreement then goes to the constituent parties to be approved.  This agreement has to go to the social partners, the trade unions, the employers and the farming organisations to be approved but the ultimate approval is the democratic approval of the Dáil.  That is the right way to do it and that is the way the last programme was done.  We talk about consensus and, of course, I would greatly welcome an all-round political consensus but I doubt very much if there is any possibility of getting it considering the diametrically opposite and conflicting views, not just on policies but on ideologies that are held in this House.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that what he has said may have been correct at a time when national agreements related solely to pay matters but in the context of the current arrangement where there is a broad legislative programme and a broad range of commitments right across the board, affecting Justice, Environment, Labour, practically all Government Departments it appears that, in the event of matters continuing as they are, it is the social partners who will determine the legislative programme of this House and any input made by the Opposition parties will cease <Col N="834" /> to be as relevant as that which derives from the social partners at the times when such agreements are negotiated?</P>

      <P>I am afraid you are quite right, that to a large extent I will be repeating myself.  I do not think there is any basic substance in what the Deputies opposite are suggesting in this regard. We agree a programme with the social partners but that is subject to the approval of the Dáil, and not just a general approval which we hope we will get within the next few weeks, and also this Dáil has the final authority to vote the money for all these things which will still have to come before the House individually for approval.  If these things have to be covered by legislation, again that legislation will still have to come before the Dáil in the normal way for approval. Therefore there is no question of the House abdicating its responsibility in these areas.  Let us look at the budget, for instance.  The budget will be brought before the House today and it will have to be approved by the Dáil.  This is exactly the same situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take Questions Nos. 8 to 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> I have dealt with many of the issues raised in these questions in my statement to the House of 18 January.</P>
    <P>The Government have been briefed by the US authorities on the meeting between the US Secretary of State and the Iraqi Foreign Minister.  As is by now well known, that meeting did not result in the commitment which everybody had hoped for on the part of Iraq, to comply with its UN obligations and international law.  During my meeting with the US Ambassador, we exchanged views on the situation.  It has not been the practice nor would it be appropriate to give details of confidential discussions of this nature.</P>
    <P>During the course of my statement to the Dáil I dealt with the question of refuelling US aircraft at Shannon and with the request to allow six American aircraft to refuel there in August of last year, following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  With the outbreak of military conflict I do not consider it would be appropriate for security reasons to give further details at this stage, other than to say that the number of requests for landing rights for US military and other flights is not abnormal.</P>
    <P>I did not feel it necessary to seek any clarification from the United Nations of the meaning of the words, quoted by Deputy De Rossa, in the UN Resolutions as the meaning of these words is clear to everyone who reads them.  Apart from the request expressed in Resolution 678, Ireland has received no request from either the United States or the United Nations in respect of participation in the Gulf War.</P>
    <P>As a member of the United Nations, we maintain contact with the Secretary General and follow closely developments in the Security Council and in the other member states.  We continue to be alert to any reasonable prospect that might result in a peaceful settlement on the basis of compliance by Iraq with the Security Council Resolutions.  In the absence of any such indication, I do not consider that an initiative on my part, at this stage, with the heads of Government in neutral or non-aligned countries, would be likely to meet with any success.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> We of course keep in close touch with our partners in the European Community about any possible diplomatic or other initiatives that might be taken to shorten the conflict.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Dáil, on 18 January, Ireland will not participate in the Gulf War.</P>
    <P>The Government are at present considering two appeals which have been received, one from the UN Disaster Relief Organisation and another from the International Committee of the Red Cross.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Dáil on 18 January, had in advance of the outbreak of war made all possible arrangements to cope with the situation that would arise for us in this country.  It would not be appropriate to give details of the security aspects of these arrangements.  The Government are satisfied with them and they are being kept under constant review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>One can agree with the Taoiseach in relation to the Government's wishing for a peaceful resolution as soon as possible in this catastrophic war that is taking place in the Gulf.  I am aware there are certain matters which may be confidential between the Taoiseach and the US Ambassador, and even the US Government, but could I seek some clarification from the Taoiseach on when the request was received by the Government in relation to the use of Shannon by US military aircraft?  Was it before the Dáil debate or since the Dáil debate?  Secondly, are the Government going to respond to the request they received from the United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation or the Red Cross for humanitarian aid either in Ireland or the Middle East which I would say will be not only acceptable to everybody in the House but indeed will be commended by all Members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first matter, the original requests were made as far back as August for six landings. Prior to the Dáil debate there were no requests.  Any requests since have been and are dealt with on their merits in <Col N="839" /> accordance with the Resolution, so there is no question of blanket cover or anything of that kind.  It is a question of requests being made from time to time and being acceded to or rejected.  In regard to the two appeals we have had, I am sure we will give favourable consideration to both because that is the best possible way we can contribute to the situation and, so to speak, participate in a humanitarian way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless I am mistaken the Taoiseach said the UN Resolution allowed that all means may be used.  In fact, the Resolution said that &ldquo;all necessary means&rdquo; may be used.  This is where the question of interpretation arises.  What precisely does, &ldquo;all necessary means&rdquo; mean?  To what extent may the forces who are involved in the action against Iraq pursue that?  At what point will the actions they take become unnecessary, particularly in view of the statement by Mr. King, the Defence Minister in Britain, that the withdrawal from Kuwait in line with Resolution 660 will not be sufficient as far as Britain is concerned? Does the Taoiseach agree with that view and that that view is covered by Resolution 678?  Has he become aware that there are experts on the UN Charter, both Irish and international, who have thrown doubt on the validity of Resolution 678 in view of its very wide-reaching effects and permissions it has provided?  Has he taken an opportunity at any time since 16 January to inform the United Nations under paragraph 4 of Resolution 678 with regard to the support the Irish Government have provided?  Is he aware whether any of the other participants in the attack on Iraq are keeping the Security Council informed of what is going on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last point, no, not specifically.  Of course, we have an Ambassador to the UN who is in constant touch with the Secretary General and would keep him informed of all these matters as far as we are concerned, but it is up to us to interpret what is appropriate support.  We have not at all <Col N="840" /> been concerned in the &ldquo;necessary means&rdquo; aspect of Resolution 678.  What we are concerned about is the call on member states to provide appropriate support. We are interpreting that and acting accordingly.</P>
      <P>With regard to disagreements on the extent of the powers conferred by the UN Resolutions, that would be a matter for the UN itself.  I do not know that it would be a matter for us, if any member state goes beyond something purported to be conferred on it by a UN Resolution, to deal with that other than in the UN. As far as we are concerned the whole situation in the Gulf is governed by the UN Resolutions and our complete support for the UN Resolutions.  That is the answer to the Deputy's question about what others may be deciding to do or how they interpret &ldquo;necessary means&rdquo;.  We support the resolutions primarily in that they call for a withdrawal from Kuwait. We also respond to the call in Resolution 678 for appropriate support by us.  We are doing that and no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put four brief questions to the Taoiseach.  By whom are decisions taken with regard to particular requests?  Are such decisions taken by the Government, by an individual Minister or is responsibility delegated &mdash; in the event of decisions having to be taken quickly &mdash; to an official?  Have any requests been rejected for landing at Shannon?  Are these landings commercial arrangements for which the relevant Irish authorities are paid and approximately how much are they paid?  Finally, have the Government themselves considered any support they believe they could give &mdash; from their knowledge of what Ireland can do &mdash; to the United Nations efforts, or are they simply taking the view that we will respond to requests from others without considering what we ourselves can do to assist the United Nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last question raised by the Deputy, I should say it is an international situation.  My <Col N="841" /> own view is that we had better operate through the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but have we considered what we can do practically to help the United Nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an implication in the question about taking initiatives with non-aligned, neutral states and so on.  In a situation like this history tells us that all sorts of people wish to get involved in initiatives of one kind or another and usually they do more harm than good.  Therefore, I think our best code of behaviour, as good international citizens, is to work exclusively and as far as possible in support of the United Nations.  If there is any other way in which we can be of assistance to the United Nations, certainly we will do so but, as of now, I do not think there is. Unfortunately we are in a war situation. At this stage what we should concentrate on, first of all, is doing what we can in the humanitarian area and, secondly, through EC political action, being alert to take any initiative that the European Community can take.  I do not think in this type of situation one-off, individual&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not what I was suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I understand that but I want to take this opportunity to say &mdash; I know that was not what Deputy Bruton had in mind; he was asking specifically if there was anything more we could do to help the UN &mdash; I do not think there is at this stage but, if an opportunity does offer, we will certainly take it.</P>
      <P>On the question of the operations at Shannon Airport, I should say that anybody landing there complies with the normal aviation requirements, including fees and charges of all kinds.  We have not had occasion to reject any particular requests made to us so far.  I do not want to go too deeply into that because I do not want to be disclosing any security aspects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the Taoiseach's attention to Question No. 19?  I do not recall the Taoiseach referring to that question in his original reply. Whereas one might differ in terms of interpretation of the United Nations Charter and the various resolutions, the Taoiseach seemed to rely entirely on the fact that we are doing everything in accordance with the United Nations. Does the Taoiseach not consider it strange that the United Nations, and the Secretary General of the United Nations, seem to be playing little or no role in relation to the conduct of the war in the Middle East, that in fact the Secretary General of the United Nations informed the public that the war had commenced a number of hours before he had been so informed?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that we should be insisting that the United Nations take a lead role in the conflict that has now arisen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by &ldquo;lead role&rdquo;.  Certainly I would not wish to see the United Nations take military action under its own aegis. Apart from that, I do not see anything specific that the United Nations can do at this stage other than make a general effort to exert diplomatic pressure to bring hostilities to an end and, of course, to contain their impact and try to stop some of the appalling atrocities taking place.  Other than that I am not so sure that the United Nations can do any more. In general, let me just say that our ambassador is there and in constant touch with the Secretary General of the United Nations.  If it emerges that we can be helpful in any way, of course we will be so.</P>
      <P>I answered the Deputy's Question No. 19 in a general way when I said, at the end of my original reply:</P>
      <P>As I also made clear, the Government had, in advance of the outbreak of war, made all possible arrangements to cope with the situation that would arise for us in this country...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>in the event of hostilities taking place.  I do not want to give any details but, of <Col N="843" /> course, security at our airports would be high on that list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>May I pose a number of questions to the Taoiseach in relation to this matter.  It has been said, not least by the Taoiseach himself, that he believed sanctions had not worked. Has he available to him a report from the United Nations on the sanctions, as they had operated up to the time the attack was launched on Iraq?  As I understand it, the United Nations Resolutions require that reports be made to a special body of the United Nations in relation to how they were operating.  Do the Government know and will the Taoiseach tell the House what reports are available to us so that we can form a judgment on that matter?  Would the Taoiseach indicate whether the Irish Government have made reports to the Security Council in relation to Resolution 678 and the appropriate support being provided by the Irish Government under that resolution? That Resolution quite clearly states, in paragraph 4, that the states concerned should keep the Security Council regularly informed on the progress of actions undertaken pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of that Resolution. Would the Taoiseach indicate where or how he draws a distinction between providing facilities for military personnel at Shannon Airport, defining that as appropriate support and as not participating in war, but apparently he regards participation directly in the war itself as inappropriate?  What rule of thumb does he use to draw that distinction?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;unavoidable, whichever word the Deputy wishes.  That does not convey any opinion on my part that sanctions did not work.  In fact, in so far as I am on record at all, I think I could claim that my view is that sanctions were not given enough time.  But circumstances developed in which, in my view &mdash; and indeed in the view of the Secretary General of the United Nations &mdash; war did become inevitable, tragically, to the disappointment of all of us.  Of course, we keep the Secretary General of the United Nations informed of what we are doing in these matters.  But the thrust of what the Deputy mentioned was directed mainly at the member states that have undertaken military action; it is they who have an obligation to report to the Security Council.  Perhaps the Deputy would remind me of the other points?</P>

      <P>No, I am simply pointing out to the Taoiseach that paragraph 4 of Resolution 678 requests the states concerned &mdash; who are acting under paragraphs 2 and 3 &mdash; to keep the Security Council informed.  I simply want to know whether the Government are complying with that requirement because it would appear to me that clearly they are not. Would the Taoiseach address himself to that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask the Taoiseach also how he draws a distinction between what is appropriate and what is inappropriate action?  As I understand it, he indicates <Col N="845" /> that the provision of over-flight refuelling and landing facilities at Shannon Airport for military aircraft involved in this war is appropriate support for Resolution 678 but apparently he draws a line in regard to actual direct involvement in the conflict itself as being inappropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This matter was fully and adequately dealt with by me during the course of the debate here on 18 January. I gave my opinion fully then, as to what was appropriate support.  I have said we have decided that the refuelling of aircraft at Shannon came definitely within the terms of appropriate support and was something we were called upon by the UN resolution to do.  I do not intend to go over that ground again today, except to repeat that we are not participants in the war and that we will give appropriate support as we interpret <Col N="846" /> it, in accordance with Resolution 678. What we have done does not constitute participation in terms of the wording of the Constitution.  We have been over all that before and there is no point in going over it again.</P>
      <P>With regard to the UN, as I keep repeating, we have an ambassador there. This is a matter of major importance for the UN and for all our personnel at the UN, and naturally they keep the UN Secretary General fully informed of anything we do.  Furthermore, we discuss regularly if there is anything further that he or we can do, or that the UN can do.</P>

Has the ambassador offered an opinion to the Government in relation to compliance of Resolution 678 with Article 28.3's conditions in relation to, for example, concurrence? Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House, if he is satisfied that Resolution 678 has a conditionality to it which arises from the other Articles, how he or how the Government would decide when it was appropriate to support or not support Resolution 678, or when the obligations to which he referred in Resolution 678 would cease, and specifically if he received a request, would he insist on such a request being from the UN, and will the Taoiseach differentiate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we are getting into rather abstruse semantics at this stage.  With regard to Deputy Higgins' question about the ambassador, on an important decision like that the Government take advice from all possible relevant sources.  We did that on this occasion but the ultimate decision is for the Government who are responsible to this House.  On the question as to the extent of the Resolution, we interpret the Resolutions as giving authority for the use of force to ensure the evacuation of Kuwait.  To that extent we accord <Col N="848" /> appropriate support to the member states who have undertaken that military action.  I know the Secretary General of the UN has expressed himself in similar terms.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that a real effort should be made at this stage to arrange a ceasefire before the land war gets under way?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that earlier in response to other questions.  We are all aware that in this sort of situation history tells us that all sorts of people wish to get in on the act, and all sorts of initiatives of one kind or another are suggested.  Very often they are more detrimental than beneficial.  We can act most beneficially in two directions, first, through the UN by giving full support to the UN, and in that regard being alert to any possibility which will arise for the UN to take action or initiatives to secure a ceasefire or a cessation of hostilities or whatever.  The second avenue available to us is the European Community.  We are keeping in close contact with our partners with a view to availing of any possibilities that may offer for the Community to exercise a useful role or take some useful diplomatic or political initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiative of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland continues to be the subject of ongoing discussions between all the parties involved.  As I have stated previously, it would not be appropriate to go into the <Col N="849" /> details of confidential discussions of this nature but the Government support the initiative and would like to see it succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the confidential nature of the discussions and also of the Government's willingness and I support the Government's hope in this regard.  Given the fact that the likelihood of talks seemed more pronounced last June and July and likewise before Christmas there was a certain focus on the content of the talks and hopes for talks to commence, at this stage is the Taoiseach satisfied or confident that talks will get under way in the short term? Will the Taoiseach outline what difficulties, if any, he sees preventing talks getting under way in the short-term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I am hopeful rather than confident.  Perhaps more importantly, the Government here are still determined to be as oncoming and supportive as possible.  Very soon now an important meeting will take place with the Secretary of State and that will give us an opportunity to assess the present situation.  The Deputy knows as well as anybody else from public reports, and without my giving away any confidential information, where the difficulty lies.  It lies in the way in which the different parties concerned will participate in the discussions.  As of yet there has been no resolution to that aspect.  I assure the Deputy that we have put forward time and again different proposals and suggestions in an endeavour to be helpful. Indeed, we have made very considerable concessions for that purpose too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do.  I do not want to talk about failure of the present initiative at this stage.  Should this initiative fail despite all our goodwill and best endeavours, I should not be at all despondent. I believe there is still a great deal of goodwill for progress in different areas and sections and we would be very anxious to pursue any possible initiative or avenue that might offer the prospect of progress.  I would not be at all pessimistic about that, but in the meantime we must concentrate on the Brooke initiative which is before us and see if by constant dialogue and even compromise we can get a solution.</P>

Would he accept that we on this side of the House do not have the same sense of resignation &mdash; almost acceptance &mdash; which he seems to be essaying this afternoon about the possibility that these talks might not succeed?  Would he agree that it is a matter of the utmost importance that democratic politicians in Northern Ireland get together and start doing business with one another and that we should do everything in our power to bring about that event rather than accept the position in a somewhat resigned fashion?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always a risk when one wishes to be as forthcoming as possible that one would be misinterpreted in that way.  I am not resigned; I am not complacent.  I am as anxious as anyone in this House to have these discussions brought to a fruitful conclusion.  We have all spent an enormous amount of time involved in discussions, dialogue, papers, counter-papers, compromises and formulae. There is no question of being resigned to failure.  That was the first thing I said in reply to Deputy Spring.  We are not contemplating failure at this stage, but we must have regard to the realities of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 to 24, inclusive, together. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiated and agreed between the Government and the social partners was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published on Tuesday, 22 January 1991.  The Government propose to seek the House's approval for the programme.</P>
      <P>The social partners are following their own procedures for approval of the programme by their individual organisations. I would like to take this opportunity to express once again my appreciation and that of the Government to all of the social partners for the constructive manner in which they engaged in the discussions leading to the formulation of this new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are satisfied, on the basis of the experience and of the economic advice of the Department of Finance, that future economic prospects will allow the objectives, especially of low inflation and competitiveness, and the commitments of the programme to be achieved over the next three years and <Col N="853" /> over the period to the end of the century. The programme will contribute substantially to our efforts to achieve the full growth and employment potential of the economy.  The Government's commitment to maintaining firm control of our public finances so that there is a steady reduction in the national debt to GNP ratio is specifically confirmed in the programme.</P>
    <P>It would be premature to seek to assess, at this stage, the possible effects of the Gulf hostilities on world and domestic economic prospects.  Should the need arise, the Central Review Committee of the programme will be in a position to carry out any review necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed under the programme to discuss with the farming organisations who are parties to the programme and the EC Commission the compensatory measures to be adopted to offset the effects of the Commission's reorientation proposals and the GATT negotiations.  In particular, the Minister for Agriculture and Food will, from the earliest possible date, enter into discussions with the farming organisations who are parties to the programme on the approach to be adopted to the Commission's reorientation proposals and maintain close contact with them as the Community negotiations on these and as the GATT discussions develop.  The Government will keep the situation under close review and use all their influence with the Commission and our Community partners to see that Irish vital national interests are protected.</P>

      <P>I would certainly welcome the opportunity of a full discussion in this House on the programme.  Many of the aspirations within it need to be fleshed out and translated into hard facts, if that is possible.  Am I correct in thinking that the assumptions on which the programme is founded are on the basis of a 2 per cent growth in the economy?  The prediction now is that we will have a growth rate of less than 1 per cent, if any growth at all, given the recession in the United Kingdom and the downturn in the US economy. The projections in the programme <Col N="854" /> are obviously interlinked.  What growth rate are the Taoiseach and the Government assuming will be achieved in the economy in 1991?</P>

      <P>The programme is not founded on any specific rate of growth in any particular year.  The general projection of our experts is that the growth of the economy over the next three years and over the decade will be of sufficient magnitude to enable us to cope with the objectives of the programme.  I said in launching the programme that if it transpires that growth falls away and is not of sufficient volume to enable us to achieve all the objectives in the programme, then the programme will have to be reviewed by the Central Review Committee.  Subject to that we are satisfied that the overall growth projected by the Irish economy over the coming years will be sufficient to enable the objectives of the programme to be attained.  The Minister for Finance will very shortly be giving a full account of the economic prospects for this year.</P>

The general answer I would have to give to the Deputy is that if there is a falling off in one sector of that industry we will just have to redouble our efforts through Bord Fáilte and otherwise to make up for that shortfall.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 45, 47, 53, 56, 60, 63, 68, 78, 84, 88, 91, 243 and 247 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The market for oil is global and transparent. Adequacy of national oil stocks must be seen, therefore, in a worldwide context.  A year ago conventional wisdom would have been that the withdrawal of Iraq's and Kuwait's oil production would have left the market in severe difficulty. In the event, the international oil market took this loss in its stride and scarcely faltered.  OPEC and non-OPEC countries <Col N="860" /> alike increased production to offset the loss.  The new equilibrium in the market was helped, of course, by a reduction in demand in some larger countries.  In OECD countries this winter's consumption is two million barrels a day less than projected.</P>
    <P>The IEA in its statement on Monday this week summed up the position as follows.</P>
    <P>The world market was well supplied with crude oil and oil products.  The combination of relatively large stocks, weak demand and ample supplies left the market in good balance. </P>
    <P>Inherent in some of the questions raised today and indeed in the media is the question: &ldquo;What if all oil supplies were cut off?&rdquo; That is a situation which is unlikely ever to arise.  The great oil fields from Alaska to Venezeula, those of the USSR, and most of the Middle East oil fields have not been, and will not be, significantly affected by the conflict in the Gulf.  The Gulf region supplies approximately 26 per cent of total world oil production.  Even in the increasingly unlikely event that Iraq did manage to damage some of the very large Saudi installations further down the Gulf, the impact on overall world oil production would be just a relatively small reduction. Our crude oil supplies come mainly from the UK and Norweigan sectors of North Sea and are under no threat whatsoever. Our oil product imports are sourced in Europe.  So, in respect of both crude oil and oil products, we are not faced with any direct threat to our oil supplies and are unlikely to be affected in any significant way if a minor shortfall emerged on the world market as a result of the Gulf War.</P>
    <P>Should any such threat emerge the Government are well placed to protect our economic interests.  Our stocks levels have never been higher than during the past number of months.  If, for example, there were to be a 10 per cent shortfall in supplies in the future, then our 90 days of stocks would allow the continuation of normal levels of supply for many multiples of 90 days.  Not only that but there <Col N="861" /> are a wide range of measures available to me to effect demand restraint very quickly.  In any event, we would also have the added comfort of being protected by our participation in IEA sharing arrangements should these be triggered off by any significant shortfall in oil supply here.</P>
    <P>Our stocks are a long term safety net with which we can sustain the level of shortage which could be expected to arise if the situation in the Gulf worsened dramatically.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that security would be enhanced if we had a government to government contract with an oil producer country and Nigeria has been referred to in this context.  Such exclusivity could, in certain circumstances, pose serious risks for security of supply rather than enhance it.  We had such contracts in the past albeit only on a medium-term basis notably in the early eighties with Iraq and the experience was not altogether a happy one.  It was abandoned in a war situation.</P>
    <P>With major changes in the pattern of the oil market, INPC, with the Minister's approval, changed to supply from North Sea, shorter term contract trading and to purchasing part of needs from the Rotterdam spot market.  Now INPC are contracted for crude with Statoil the Norweigian State Company, but are free to buy part of their crude needs on the spot market.  This reflects the pattern of a very large number of Europe's oil refining companies.  My policy is to balance security with good commerciality by INPC. We are doing this.</P>
    <P>There would not now be any greater virtue in a government to government deal, even if that were possible.  There is certainly no need for it.</P>
    <P>The oil companies continue to import most of their requirements in product form from the UK.  That country is virtually self-sufficient in its oil needs. There is no reason their supplies should not continue and that is the view of the companies here to whom my Department's officials have spoken at top management level.  Our security rests on this, on the stocks which are in place, and on an on-going refining capacity maintained, <Col N="862" /> I might say, in the face of considerable criticism at the time and improved significantly since then by the INPC and with greater understanding and collaboration of the oil companies in recent years.</P>
    <P>Details of national stocks, including stocks at Whitegate Refinery and in the form of crude at Whiddy, are being circulated for the information of the Members of the House.  Let me state that the data which are being circulated now for information have been the subject of much discussion, speculation and distortion in recent weeks.  This widespread confusion was totally unnecessary as all interested media and notably some of the commentators who were the source of this confusion about oil stocks, were invited by me, personally, to discuss the matter in detail with my Department and were facilitated in every way possible.  I would hope that the information which I propose to issue today will be portrayed accurately to the public and that no further ráiméis will appear.  The stocks tables circulated address the quantitative aspects of the questions now being taken. Since Thursday, 18 January, summary daily stocks data have been issued to the media by my Department and we are happy to provide this data to other interested parties on request.</P>
    <P>In general, the supply situation remains most satisfactory.  I have on previous occasions outlined to the Dáil the methods by which I ensured that national stock levels were increased since 2 August last year to meet, and indeed to exceed, EC and IEA stock requirements. The throughput at the national refinery was maximised in order to boost stocks of petrol and gas oil.  Indeed, I ordered the reopening of Whiddy terminal and additional cargoes of crude oil were put in place there.  In addition, major unused storage both in the private sector and that of the ESB was utilised to augment stocks of diesel and petrol.</P>
    <P>I have taken additional measures to ensure our readiness for any supply difficulties that might be envisaged.  I set up an interdepartmental consultancy and advisory group to allow direct and speedy <Col N="863" /> exchange of information between the various organs of the State.  I also established an operations group which includes the chief executives of the major oil companies, the INPC, CII, IFA and senior officials of my Department.  This group will organise the smooth operation of oil supplies in any shortfall.  I have received excellent co-operation from all sectors in that group.  The oil industry representatives have assured me of the adequacy of oil supplies and are in full agreement with the stocks figures which I publish daily.</P>
    <P>I would like also to assure the House that the European Commission and the International Energy Agency are in full agreement with our stocks figures and have verified that Ireland complies fully with their requirement.  Indeed the methods used in formulating the returns to the European Community and the International Energy Agency by my Department are well known and have remained consistent since the stocks obligations were first introduced 15 years ago.  There is, therefore, no question of double counting of stocks now or any time in the past.</P>
    <P>Given the present favourable oil supply situation I am satisfied that an appropriate level of oil stocks are being held by this country.  Besides the stocks which I have placed in Whiddy and elsewhere, the private sector also has a stockholding obligation to the State.  In general these obligations are met.  As part of the consideration paid by the Government to the then four owners of the Whitegate refinery, each one of these major companies were allowed to claim part of Whitegate stocks as part of their own obligation.  The total of such stocks for the four companies is 170,000 tonnes as agreed by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the intervention because it gives me the opportunity to emphasise that the agreement I have just referred to was negotiated by the then Minister, Michael O'Leary, the then Leader of the Labour Party, and he obtained the then Government's approval for it in early 1982.</P>
      <P>There have, however, been certain difficulties on the part of some small indigenous companies on the periphery of the domestic oil supply scene in meeting specific stock obligations.  These problems in some instances date back many years.  While it will remain the policy of my Department to secure full compliance with stocks holding obligations by all concerned, the nature of these companies and the extent of their operations are so small that they have only a marginal effect on the overall national aggregate stock picture.</P>
      <P>In spite of the very satisfactory underlying international and national stock position there have been some minor difficulties relating to deliveries in the last few weeks.  Continuous storms around the cost of Ireland and, indeed, Western Europe in January led to the deferment of certain cargoes.  This led to short-term bottlenecks in berthing at Milford Haven and other refineries and the telescoping of the pattern of coastal deliveries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>These minor bottlenecks are now being sorted out.  Shipping patterns are returning to normal and I can assure the House that deliveries are scheduled not only for Dublin but for the full range of traditional coastal ports which take oil, notably New Ross, Arklow, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Fenit, Galway, Drogheda, Greenore. Storm deferral deliveries to Derry also <Col N="865" /> affected Inishowen, but here, as elsewhere, these bottlenecks are being rapidly eliminated.</P>
      <P>Indeed, oil companies ranging from the majors down to the local delivery services have coped extremely well with the unprecedented demand for home heating oil.  The convergence of the cold weather around Christmas, the delay in certain deliveries due to the coastal storms and, in certain areas of the country, icy roads stretched the capacity of the delivery system for a number of days.  In general the sector coped very well with these problems, which are now being rapidly accommodated.</P>
      <P>Although, as the tabulated statements show, stock levels on a product-by-product basis are high, the House will be aware of the recent exhortations I have made in the media to consumers regarding the efficient use of fuels and the necessity for the continuation of normal consumption levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Increased consumption and consumer hoarding of certain fuels &mdash; mainly home heating oil and diesel, led to unprecedented demand levels for these fuels in the past few weeks.  The advance purchases of home heating have not led to increases in comsumption; rather they represent in themselves a further element of national stock which is not claimed or indicated in my Department's figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The data which has been distributed <Col N="866" /> does not differentiate between operational and strategic stocks as in any event on a practical basis all stocks are available for national use.  No such differentiation is required under EC or Irish legislation.  Furthermore, along with several other member states we do not take any account of jet fuel stocks for EC reporting purposes.  Stock data on LPG is not normally collected by my Department, LPG is gas not oil and as such does not form part of our EC oil stock obligation.</P>
    <P>The stocks data which I have circulated does not include overseas stocks held by others on behalf of INPC; crude oil and/or product stocks in transit to Ireland; stocks held by garage proprietors and crude and/or products on order but not yet transmitted to Ireland and oil sent abroad for refining.  Oil Companies' stocks are clearly indicated on the tables.  As for the future, I will be guided by developments in the international oil supply situation when deciding whether a further increase in oil stocks would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>I would again remind Deputies that we are not faced with any immediate or likely threat to our oil supplies and I would again assure the House, as I have assured the public on a number of occasions since August, that Ireland's stock position is not only satisfactory but is more secure now than at any time for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, television is bringing my budget address &mdash; quite literally &mdash; home to people, for the first time.</P>
      <P>Over the past 12 months, television has confronted viewers in Ireland with the reality of global change &mdash; startling, fast, global change.  We have seen major upheavals in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.  We have seen the reunification of Germany.  We have seen the impact of Ireland's Presidency of the European Community.  We have seen the advance toward the Single Market, towards economic and monetary union within Europe and, right now, we are seeing the tragedy of war in the Middle East.  My budget, today, must take account of these developments.</P>
      <P>For the coming year, we have got to plan against a difficult and uncertain international background.  But equally, we need to look beyond 1991, out over the medium-term and towards the end of the century.  When world growth prospects are unpredictable, it is doubly important that we are prudent in the way we manage our domestic affairs.  That is why it is a matter of great satisfaction to the Government that a new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has been agreed with all the social partners.</P>
      <P>The new programme creates the framework for a ten year national strategy. It is a charter to see us through to the year 2000.</P>
      <P>Chruthaigh an chéad chlár gur fíor ar fad an seanfhocal &mdash;&ldquo;Ní neart go cur le chéile&rdquo;.  Tá an sprid díreach céanna taobh thiar den chlár nua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget I am presenting today is based on the social and economic philosophy of the programme.  It sees growth <Col N="1039" /> in employment as top of the list of priorities. It sets out to consolidate and build on the considerable progress of the last few years.  That progress must not diminish our resolve to keep borrowing under strict control and maintain the downward pressure on debt.  Nothing must be allowed to jeopardise the exemplary containment of annual borrowing we have achieved.  Sound economic management of our public finances must go on if we are to continue to create jobs for our people.</P>
    <P>The national debt is still a problem, a problem that must not be forgotten, a problem not to be glossed over.  Despite the progress we have made in reducing borrowing, there is still a major overhang of debt.  The servicing of that debt preempts a huge element of the budget. Why?  Because it is one of our largest overheads.  The Government have acted to reduce this debt-servicing burden, and to free the resources we need to fund our public spending programmes and our tax reform programme.</P>
    <P>I have always stressed that disadvantaged people in our society should benefit from any economic progress we achieve.  That, again, is going to be one of my priorities today.  A budget must have a social dimension.  It must give expression to our responsibility for the welfare of all our people and today's budget will address key aspects of social policy.  Of course it is not possible, no matter how much we would wish it were possible, to make progress on all fronts within the limited resources we have. Thus, today's budget is a balanced package of measures designed to make the most of the resources available to us.</P>
    <P>In a very real sense, today's budget is a bridge: a bridge linking the progress we made under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with the progress we are aiming for under the new programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>1990 Budget Outturn</i>
    </P>
    <P>Before I deal with the Government's broad strategy on the economy and the public finances, I want to refer briefly to the 1990 budget outturn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> Tax receipts were about £160 million ahead of the budget estimate &mdash; 2.5 per cent over target.  A major contributor to that was an excellent corporation tax yield &mdash; some 40 per cent ahead of forecast. That happened because of the cumulative impact of the reforms made in the last three years.  Stronger employment growth than anticipated helped income tax revenue to come in higher also.</P>
    <P>On the spending side, current expenditure was, for the first time in four years, a little over target.  Exchequer borrowing for capital was about £34 million more than estimated last year.  The main factor in both of these cases was a delay in EC receipts but the key feature of the budget outturn for 1990 was that, in spite of these adverse timing influences, overall Government borrowing remained at its lowest level in over 40 years.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement was kept to 2 per cent of GNP.  The current budget deficit was at its lowest level since the early seventies.  The crucial debt-GNP ratio continued on a firm downward path; the ratio was just over 111 per cent at the end of 1990, compared to 131 per cent as late as 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic Situation and Outlook</i>
    </P>
    <P>The immediate economic prospect is an important factor in the preparation of any budget.  As usual, I am publishing today, with the other budget documents, my Department's latest economic assessment.</P>
    <P>Last year, our economic performance was, again, among the best in Europe. Output rose by about 5 per cent.  Our economy has now grown by about 10 per cent in the last two years.  Investment moved rapidly forward.  Consumer spending continued to expand.  Our external competitiveness against the EMS narrow-band countries got even better and the balance of payments stayed solidly in surplus.  Prices moved up by 3.4 per cent last year, compared with 4 per cent the previous year, and compared with an EC average of about 5.5 per cent.  More significantly, annual inflation up to last November, despite <Col N="1041" /> higher oil prices, stood at 2.7 per cent. That is far below the British rate, and the second lowest in the European Community. That is a major achievement, with major benefits right across the board.  Low inflation helps everybody.</P>
    <P>Our currency maintained a strong position within the narrow band of the EMS and our interest rate differential with Germany has narrowed by 7 percentage points since March 1987.</P>
    <P>Definite proof emerged that the improvement in economic fundamentals is yielding substantial employmnent gains.  In the year to April 1990, total employment went up by 30,000.  Subsequent indicators suggest that employment has continued to rise.  It is estimated that the average number at work was up by more than 20,000, compared with 1989.  Unemployment, as measured by the live register average, fell by nearly 7,000.</P>
    <P>Now, we have to face the fact that the favourble international environment of the last few years is changing.  Changing for the worse, not the better.  Already, demand in our export markets is being affected, adversely affected.  Already international sentiment is being affected, again adversely affected.  The latest forecast is that growth in the OECD area may decelerate to around 2 per cent.  The European Commission's assessment of Community prospects is similar.  The important UK market is likely to be very weak this year.</P>
    <P>The international slowdown is going to have repercussions on our growth prospects. There is no avoiding that but I am still confident that we can make progress &mdash; economic and social progress &mdash; this year.  It is just likely to be at a more modest pace than in the recent past.</P>
    <P>There are good solid reasons we can maintain progress.  First, investment growth here, supported by the EC Structural Funds, should remain relatively strong, as business continues to gear up for the Single European Market.  Second, the measures I am taking in this budget, together with the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> are going to help underpin that investment, and a <Col N="1042" /> further rise in consumer spending.  Third, I am confident that we can achieve a creditable export performance in 1991, despite modest growth abroad.  I am assuming that overseas markets will expand broadly as projected by the EC in December last.  While recent trends might suggest lower oil prices than the $29 per barrel the Commission assumed, the greater uncertainty now obtaining may well offset this.  Our better competitive position should let us take a bigger share of less buoyant international growth.  Finally, inflation will remain low. Taking account of the measures I am announcing today, the rise in consumer prices this year should be quite close to 3 per cent.  The sharp reduction in pump prices of oil since last autumn will come through in our next inflation figures. Beyond then we have to hope that oil prices on average will not be much above the mid-twenties.</P>
    <P>Taking all factors into account, I am projecting output growth this year of around 2¼ per cent, with real GNP up by around the same.  That kind of growth should stimulate more gains on the employment front.</P>
    <P>I expect there will be 11,000 more jobs in non-agricultural sectors in 1991.  That is not to say that there will not be pressure on the level of unemployment.  Demographic factors and reduced emigration will probably result in an appreciably bigger labour force.  Emigration is going down because we are creating more opportunities at home, and there are fewer opportunities abroad, especially in Britain and the United States.  All of this means that, despite the further growth in employment, we can expect the Live Register average to increase from last year's 224,700 to 228,000.  So our key long term objective has to be to create more jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Medium-Term Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>If we are going to achieve consistent, strong economic growth, if we are going to close the gap in employment opportunities and living standards between this country and the rest of the European Community, then there are a number of <Col N="1043" /> things we must do.  We must secure our position as a low inflation country within the European Monetary System as a prelude to full participation in Economic and Monetary Union.  We must improve our international competitiveness &mdash; especially through moderation of income and other costs &mdash; right across the economy. We must maintain the best possible climate for investment and job creation. We can only do that by demonstrating continued discipline in the public finances. That is the road to confidence.  That is the key to competitive interest rates. We must develop an efficiency culture and make sure that the right incentives are there for effort and enterprise. Reform of taxation, of expenditure programmes and of the regulatory framework can all play a part.</P>
    <P>Protecting and improving the living standards of disadvantaged people has to be an integral part of our overall strategy. Now, let there be no doubt, if we do not get continued restraint in public borrowing, if we do not get continued reduction in the burden of debt, all of our aspirations are going to be frustrated.</P>
    <P>Just servicing the debt, at the moment, demands more than £2,000 million.  Or, to put it another way, nearly 75 per cent of what we get from income tax goes to service that debt.  That is more than the total cost of running some of our major spending Departments.  We all agree that we need improvements to public services. We all agree that we need improvements to our tax systems.  We cannot have those improvements &mdash; we certainly cannot have them as comprehensively as we might want &mdash; until we cut away some more of this borrowing burden.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Government set the target of bringing the ratio of national debt to GNP down towards 100 per cent by 1993.  I now reaffirm this objective. We have also adopted a new longer-term aim, that of bringing our debt-GNP ratio more into line with the rest of the European Community.  It is against this background that the 1991 budget has been framed and the new programme agreed. A weakening of resolve or the wrong <Col N="1044" /> response to unfavourable international development, could very quickly &mdash; all too quickly &mdash; undo the progress made since 1987.  A more difficult world environment may actually require us to be more, not less, resolute in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> what we have done is forge a powerful shield to protect us in the difficult days ahead.  It is a comprehensive charter for our development over the next ten years.  Its proposals on pay will help keep our costs in line.  Its wider social and economic dimension will provide the means of growth and the basis for distributing the fruits of economic progress.  The programme represents the first instalment of a ten year national enterprise.  This longer-term partnership will enable substantial progress during the nineties towards fulfilling our main aspirations.</P>
    <P>Approval of the programme offers: economic and fiscal stability, assurance about employment costs and a foundation for a further period of industrial peace.  These are all crucial.</P>
    <P>I am providing today for the priority improvements in social policy agreed in the programme discussions.  My budget also includes proposals for further reform of taxation &mdash; in pursuit of the tax objectives outlined in the programme. At the same time, it consolidates the improving public finances.</P>
    <P>In effect, this budget is the initial Government contribution to a decade-long partnership for linked economic and social progress.  But let me make one thing crystal clear: the programme's overall goals will be pursued within the overriding economic and budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>With colder international breezes already blowing, 1991 is going to be the true test of our perseverance on fiscal policy.  Be assured; the Government will not fail that test.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Opening Budget Position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The opening current budget deficit, based on the published 1991 Estimates of <Col N="1045" /> Receipts and Expenditure is £183 million, after allowing for the deduction of £15 million for departmental balances.  The opening Exchequer borrowing requirement is £397 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>I am now going to look at the public expenditure components of the budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Central Fund Services and Debt Management</i>
    </P>
    <P>The estimate for Central Fund Services is £2,787 million; of this figure £2,409 million is in respect of debt service payments and £367 million is in respect of our contribution to the EC budget, an increase of £83 million on the 1990 outturn.</P>
    <P>The debt service figure represents an increase of 4.7 per cent on the 1990 outturn of £2,300 million.  This increase is mainly attributable to the additional cost of new Exchequer borrowing, together with the higher cost of refinancing maturing debt.  In spite of these additional costs, debt service payments in 1991, at 10.1 per cent of GNP, are more than one per cent of GNP less than in 1988.</P>
    <P>I did promise in the last budget that a new Government agency would be established to actively manage the national debt.  The National Treasury Management Agency is now in existence and is recruiting staff at the moment.  The borrowing and debt management functions of the Minister for Finance have been delegated to the agency, as have the related operational responsibilities of the Department.  I expect that the agency will make savings of £40 million in 1991; this amount was deducted in arriving at the debt service figure I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exchange Rate Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>Since assuming office, we have resolutely pursued a policy of maintaining a firm exchange rate within the narrow band of the EMS.  That policy has greatly helped to reduce interest rate differentials with other countries and bring our inflation rate comfortably below the Community average.  We are committed, <Col N="1046" /> without reservation, to a firm exchange rate.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NON-CAPITAL SUPPLY SERVICES</P>
    <P>
      <i>Opening Position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure published last weekend shows net non-capital supply services at £6,189 million.  This figure is above that published in the Abridged Estimates Volume last December, mainly because of the inclusion of pay provisions totalling £191 million.  This covers the basic pay increase in the draft agreement on pay and conditions under the new programme, and the cost of special pay increases which have to be provided for under the 1987 public service pay agreement.</P>
    <P>Pay, of course, is only one of the factors exerting upward pressure on expenditure generally in 1991.  The need for us to spend more in areas attracting EC Structural Funds is also contributing to the rise.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Re-Assessment of 1991 Spending Allocations</i>
    </P>
    <P>When the 1991 Abridged Estimates were published last December, I said that the Government intended to review the published allocations, to seek further reductions, and where possible, to redirect resources to areas of greater priority.</P>
    <P>The results of this review enable me to reduce the White Paper figure for net non-capital supply services by £33 million.  This brings the opening figure to £6,156 million or £6,141 million when estimated departmental balances of £15 million are taken into account.  Details of these adjustments are set out in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget,</i> which is being circulated separately.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1991 Summary Public Capital Programme, published last December, totalled £1,811 million.  As with non-capital spending, this figure must now be revised to take account of developments in the <Col N="1047" /> intervening period.  The review of spending allocations allows me to marginally reduce Exchequer-funded spending by some £3 million.  But this is more than offset by additional non-Exchequer spending of £14 million by the State body sector.  The net effect is to increase the published 1991 programme by £11 million to £1,822 million.  Again, details of the changes are in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Programme Outlays</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have already included in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure a provision of £35 million in 1991 for non-programme outlays.  This is intended to cover any essential financial restructuring costs of State-sponsored bodies and other miscellaneous capital payments.</P>
    <P>I now propose to make a number of additions to non-capital and capital spending, starting with Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Welfare, the Elderly and Disadvantaged</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have a strong commitment to the poor and the disadvantaged in this country.  This budget, like our last three, continues to give effect to that caring philosophy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Weekly Welfare Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>There will be a 4 per cent increase, with effect from late July, in weekly welfare payments generally, and also health allowances.  This is in line with the basic pay increase for the first year of the programme, and ensures a fair deal for those dependent on welfare payments.  But I want to point out that this 4 per cent increase in welfare rates goes beyond the commitment in the programme to match inflation.  By way of example, the rate of old age contributory pension for a person under 80 will increase from £61.50 to £64 a week.</P>
    <P>The Government are also acting on their commitment to move towards the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare by 1993.  Thus, people on the lowest payments, especially with large families, will again receive particular attention this year.  For example, a married couple with three <Col N="1048" /> children in receipt of supplementary welfare allowances are going to get an increase of £10 a week or over 9 per cent; going from £109 to £119 per week.</P>

        <i>Twenty-one Year Olds in Full-Time Education</i>

        <i>Carer's Allowance</i>

      <P>The Government intend to change the entitlement conditions for old age contributory pensions. This will address the position at the moment where some contributors with a contribution record of full and modified cover fail to qualify for contributory pensions. Again, the Minister for Social Welfare will be explaining the implementation of this welcome change a little later.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Family Income Supplement</i>
      </P>
      <P>The family income supplement scheme is aimed at lower income workers with families.  These are also the people who most often find themselves in a poverty trap.  That is precisely the reason I have improved the scheme, improved it steadily, in recent budgets.</P>
      <P>I am therefore providing a further £1 million in 1991 &mdash; representing £2.5 million in a full year &mdash; to fund substantial improvements in the scheme.  These improvements will be designed, among other things, to increase significantly the amount of the supplement payable to beneficiaries generally under the scheme. An indication of the improvements is that existing beneficiaries with two children and on incomes below the present limit of £143 a week will receive an extra £11 of supplement each week.</P>
      <P>Particular attention is going to be paid to those on the lowest incomes.  The Government have also decided that the scheme will be extended to families with children aged 18 to 21 in full-time education.  Every effort will be made, moreover, to make sure that those families who are entitled to payments actually get them; actually benefit from the scheme.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Special Equal Treatment Payments</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special equal treatment payments, introduced originally in 1986, will be continued in 1991.  As in previous years, they will be reduced in amount, in the context <Col N="1050" /> of the general improvement in welfare rates, but in such a way as to protect recipients of the special payments against a reduction in overall benefit.  The 1991 Estimates have already provided for this.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Programmes for Women</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year I made a special allocation of £0.5 million for programmes for women, in recognition of the fact that the women of this country make a huge contribution to the tackling of major social problems.  The bulk of these funds were allocated to locally based women's groups and this scheme was very successful. A wide variety of worthwhile projects were funded, in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Mayo, Limerick and elsewhere. I am making the same kind of allocation in 1991 to let this programme continue.</P>

      <P>The allocation arrangements will be made by the Minister for Social Welfare.  A special grant of £10,000 is being made from this allocation to the Aoibhneas Centre for women with children suffering violence in the home; and a grant of £25,000 is being made to the Women's Aid Organisation which also helps women who are victims of domestic violence.  It will also be open to other women's organisations, such as the Rape Crisis Centres, to apply for assistance under this scheme again this year.</P>

        <i>Grants for Voluntary and Community Organisations</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responding once again this year to our long tradition in this country of assisting local community development activities.  I am allocating £0.5 million from the national lottery for grants to voluntary and community organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, what happened was that this scheme funded a number of community development projects in areas such as <Col N="1051" /> Tallaght in Dublin, Knocknaheeny in Cork, Inishowen in Donegal and Louisburgh in Mayo.  That is being continued. I am providing additional funds so that it can be extended to projects in areas like Waterford, west Cork, Kilkenny and north Wicklow.  This allocation will also allow grants to be made to a number of organisations helping the homeless and disabled, including: The Catholic Social Service Conference, The Irish Wheelchair Association, The National Association for the Deaf and marriage counselling organisations.  Fifty thousand pounds from this allocation will go to the Simon Community for their work with the homeless.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Educationally Disadvantaged People</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government know that the full educational potential of many pupils is just not being realised &mdash; cannot be realised &mdash; because of their disadvantaged background.  The programme proposes initiatives to address this issue, and I have made a point of making provision for them.  A further 60 teachers will be allocated to post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas for the 1991-92 school year.  These appointments are additional to the 60 posts created last autumn.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fund for Educationally Disadvantaged People</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have also approved the establishment of a fund to tackle disadvantage at all levels of our educational system.  This fund of £1 million is an extra &mdash; over and above the various allocations for initiatives to favour disadvantaged people already provided in the Education Votes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>PRSI and Health Contributions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have considered the Report of the Interdepartmental Study on PRSI and Income Tax and the Lower Paid.  We have also had discussions with the Social Partners &mdash; and these discussions will continue throughout 1991. In the meantime, the employees' PRSI exemption scheme I introduced in last year's budget will continue in its present <Col N="1052" /> form.  Current rates of PRSI contribution for employees and employers will be maintained in 1991-92.</P>
    <P>When it comes to self-employed contributors, the 5 per cent rate will remain in 1991-92, although this will be constantly reviewed.  The minimum contribution amounts of £104 and £208 per year introduced in 1988 will be increased in line with changes in money values since then.  Thus, their 1991-92 levels will be £117 and £234.  For 1991-92, the earnings ceilings for contributions will increase from £17,300 to £18,000 for employees and the self-employed, and from £18,600 to £19,300 for employers.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that in order to help fund the major development of community health services and the extension of eligibility for hospital services envisaged under the programme, and to which I will return, the Health contribution should apply to all income, as is already the case with the employment and training levy.  So the income ceiling for payment of the Health contribution will be abolished from the current year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Insurance for Part-Time Workers</i>
    </P>
    <P>This country now has over 70,000 regular part-time workers, that is, 6.4 per cent of all regular workers.  A sizeable minority of these workers who are employed for fewer than 18 hours a week are excluded from full social insurance cover.  That should not be the case.  So the Government have decided to extend full insurance cover, on an appropriate basis, to part-time workers generally. Arrangements will be made to implement this decision from 6 April this year.</P>
    <P>As a direct result of that decision, up to 21,000 more part-time workers will have access to social insurance benefits, short and long term, such as unemployment benefit when out of work, disability benefit when sickness strikes, and contributory pension when the worker is old.  These benefits will be structured so as to preserve the incentive to work.  The detailed provisions will be the subject of legislation to be brought to the House by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" />
      <i>Income tax: Exemption for the Low paid</i>
    </P>
    <P>In 1989 I began a process of integrating the social welfare and tax systems to help those on low incomes.  In last year's budget I developed that process.  People on low pay, especially those with children, have benefited considerably. Resources have gone to where they were most needed.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government promise to give consideration to further adjustment of the income tax exemption limits, and of the child addition to them. Accordingly, I propose to make the following improvements, the general exemption limits will go up from £6,500 to £6,800 for a married couple and from £3,250 to £3,400 for a single person, the special child addition to the exemption limit, which now stands at £300 per child, will go up to £500 in respect of the third and subsequent child, the age exemption limits will also be raised.  A married couple aged 65 years or over will pay no tax if their income does not exceed £7,800.  If they are 75 years or over, the figure will be £9,000.  The figures for single taxpayers will be £3,900 and £4,500, respectively, the marginal relief rate, which applies where income does not greatly exceed the exemption limits, will also be reduced.</P>
    <P>The increases in the general exemption limits and in the child addition, mark the third budget in a row in which I have improved the tax treatment of low-paid married couples with children.  The changes have been very substantial and have greatly helped low paid families.</P>
    <P>For example, in 1988, the general exemption limit for a married couple, regardless of how many children they had, was £5,500.  Now, it will be £7,400 for a couple with two children, an increase of nearly 35 per cent, £7,900 for a couple with three children, an increase of nearly 44 per cent and £8,400 for a couple with four children, an increase of over 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>This package of measures will exempt an estimated 18,000 taxpayers with 23,000 children from tax altogether, <Col N="1054" /> while a further 26,500 taxpayers with 36,000 children will be brought into marginal relief.  Some 54,000 taxpayers with 95,000 children, currently in marginal relief, will get a reduction in their tax bill.</P>
    <P>Let me give some examples of what these tax changes are going to mean for different categories of taxpayers on PAYE: A married couple with three children and an income of £7,900 will have their current tax liability of up to £265 eliminated.  A married couple with four children and an income of £8,400 will have their current tax liability of up to £371 eliminated.</P>
    <P>These changes will, again, benefit not only low-paid employees and pensioners, but also low-income farmers and small shopkeepers.  Indeed, they are going to benefit low income self-employed people generally.</P>
    <P>As usual, the Revenue Commissioners will be making people aware of these improvements.  An information leaflet with a short application form built into it is to be sent out with the tax-free allowance certificates to low-paid taxpayers over the coming weeks.  The leaflet will alert taxpayers to the family income supplement scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare and it will tell people how they can obtain details of that scheme.</P>
    <P>These exemption limits and child addition improvements, when combined with improvements in the family income supplement scheme, are going to be of substantial help to low-income employees with children.  Here are examples of the combined effect of the exemption limit and FIS changes: a married employee with two children, earning £7,400, will gain £9 a week; a married employee on £7,900 with three children will get an extra £12 a week.  The total cost of this welfare package, covering cash benefits generally and tax relief for those on low incomes and provision for the educationally disadvantaged, will come to £72 million in 1991, and to almost £168 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I am now going to turn to other social areas where I am allocating additional funds in 1991.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" />
      <i>Provisions Linked to Programme for Economic and Social Progress &mdash; Long-Term Unemployed.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> sets out a new, ambitious approach to stimulate an integrated community response, in particular local areas, to long term unemployment.  The Government have undertaken to begin this approach on a pilot basis in 1991, in both rural and urban areas.  That will allow us to find out what works.  The models that work will then be applied nationwide by 1994 as resources become available from a growing economy.</P>
    <P>Since the aim is to pull together and make more effective what various agencies and bodies are doing in this area, the bulk of the Exchequer finance in 1991 is going to come from existing published allocations but I am also allocating £0.5 million to cover managerial and other overhead costs of the local companies which are going to get under way this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have undertaken as part of the programme a series of important measures in education.  At primary level, the overall pupil-teacher ratio will be reduced to 25:1 by September 1992. By next September, the necessary recruitment programmes will be in place.</P>
    <P>The allocation of the additional teachers will particularly favour schools in disadvantaged areas.  At second level a pupil-teacher ratio of 19:1 will be phased in over 1991 and 1992.  Half of the additional posts will be provided in 1991.</P>
    <P>I am providing £4.3 million to meet the 1991 cost of the programme undertakings in education.  That includes the measures for the educationally disadvantaged I mentioned earlier.  We will continue our policy of increasing third level intake of students by at least 1,200 again this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health</i>
    </P>
    <P>Turning now to health, this Government are committed to: a radical overhaul of the health services, an overhaul aimed at providing, for the first time in Ireland, <Col N="1056" /> a comprehensive, even-handed and efficient health care system, and an overhaul that centres health care on the patient.</P>
    <P>That starts with primary health care and community based services.  The developments planned will cover older people who have a physical or mental handicap and psychiatric patients.</P>
    <P>What is behind the developments is a determination to allow people to live at home as long as they can, and to operate within the community if they are able to. But it goes further than that.  We want to create a situation which lets more people in long-stay institutions move back into the community.  We are planning a seven year programme in this area.  For 1991 I am providing £8 million, half of that will come from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>A fairer deal in the area of hospital services is also on the way.  The major change in eligibility will mean that the income limit for Category 2 services will be abolished from 1 June next so that all patients opting for a public ward bed will be entitled to free consultant services.</P>

      <P>The important role of private medicine and of voluntary health insurance is not going to be diminished &mdash; the Government will see to <Col N="1057" /> that.  Health insurance premiums will continue to receive full income tax relief as they do at the moment.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Agriculture and Food</i>
      </P>
      <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government reiterated their commitment to maximise the contribution which the agriculture and food sector will make to the economy.  In the meantime, to give substance to the Government's undertakings, I propose to implement measures to support farm incomes and boost activity and confidence in the sector.</P>
      <P>First, I propose to bring forward into 1991 the increases in headage rates scheduled for 1992.  This, added to the already proposed extension of the disadvantaged areas, will provide an additional £19 million in 1991 and £27.5 million in a full year towards support of farm incomes.  I am also proposing to index the standard costings of farm improvements from August this year, adding almost £2 million in a full year to grants for farm improvement purposes.  More flexibility will come into play on the attainment of the one labour unit under the installation aid scheme at a cost of about £600,000 this year and £1 million in a full year. One million pounds will be provided this year to help very low income farming families.  This scheme will, in due course, be subsumed into the expected EC scheme.</P>
      <P>Teagasc will get an extra £1.2 million this year to help them provide the fullest service to farmers.  My attitude remains, though, that all services should, wherever possible, be paid for by the beneficiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Common Agriculture Policy becomes more market-oriented, the effort to market Irish food products has to be intensified.  That is why the Government, when finalising the 1991 Estimates, decided to allocate £1.5 million to CBF, a three-fold increase on the original 1990 Estimates allocation.  This increase is conditional on a substantial contribution being made by the meat industry and, in accordance with the governing principles running through my farming proposals <Col N="1058" /> otherwise, I want this achieved in a manner which will not reduce the return to the farmer.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain the status of the national herd, I am providing £2 million in 1991 to depopulate herds affected by BSE.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Thoroughbred Horse Industry</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Horse Breeding Advisory Committee have recommended the establishment of a representative body for the non-thoroughbred industry in order to promote the industry and improve the quality of sport horses.  I propose to provide £75,000 in 1991 towards the administrative costs of setting up this body.  In due course, it will take over the maintenance of horse registering from the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing to provide £10,000 to the Connemara Pony Society to assist them to keep the Stud Book up to date &mdash; an important factor when it comes to marketing this very important Irish breed.</P>

      <P>The costs of the extension of the disadvantaged areas and the increased grant to CBF are already included in the Abridged Estimates Volume.

      <P>
        <i>Farming Taxation</i>

      <P>I will cover farming taxation when I come to taxation measures generally.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Social Housing</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want to come to social housing. The programme sets out a broad strategy to meet social housing needs.  It takes particular account of the contribution of the voluntary housing sector &mdash; we have <Col N="1059" /> to acknowledge and support that contribution.</P>
    <P>The new initiatives in the programme include: the introduction of a new rental subsidy scheme for voluntary housing, a scheme of shared-ownership for low income house purchasers and a new allowance for people leaving local authority accommodation to move into private housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The expanded voluntary housing programme will cost £11 million in 1991.  That covers the cost of significant improvements in the grant levels, as well as the completion of the &ldquo;Focus&rdquo; housing project at Stanhope Street in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The total capital being spent on social housing this year is over £80 million compared with about £70 million last year. Further details of new schemes will be announced shortly by the Minister for the Environment.  These will include increases in loan and grant limits under the local authority house purchase loan scheme and the voluntary housing programme.</P>
      <P>In addition to the programme measures, funding of £0.5 million from the national lottery is being provided to the Department of the Environment in 1991 for the provision of communal facilities in voluntary housing schemes grant aided by the State.  Dining areas, kitchens, laundry facilities, sittingrooms, are the kind of facilities that will be provided in large projects, so that residents can get on with their day-to-day activities in a community atmosphere.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Tourism</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the prospective difficulties arising for tourism from the Gulf crisis and from the climate of recession in some of our main markets, I am allocating an additional £1 million for Bord Fáilte for marketing and promotion in <Col N="1060" /> 1991, particularly in the UK and mainland European markets.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cork Ferry</i>
    </P>
    <P>In addition, I have already provided for the renewal of the £0.5 million loan to Swansea-Cork Ferries Limited.  This service has made a substantial contribution to tourism in the south-west region.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conservation of State Buildings</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our heritage buildings are beautiful. They are of cultural value, they are of tourism value and we must preserve them.  We have progressively increased funding through the Office of Public Works to step up their programme of restoration of State buildings.  As circumstances permit, we will assist the restoration and conservation of key privately owned heritage properties fully open to the public.  I am allocating £0.5 million this year from the national lottery for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business Start-up Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>Two years ago, at my request, the banks agreed to lend up to £10 million for the development of business opportunities of young entrepreneurs.  The scheme has been operating with success. I am pleased to see that the Bank of Ireland has recently renewed and extended its contribution.  It has committed a further £2 million for its business start-up scheme.  I welcome this development and I hope that other financial institutions will follow suit.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Numbers</i>
    </P>
    <P>Numbers employed in the public service at the beginning of this year are estimated to be 199,000, that is 18,000 fewer than in 1987.  The consolidation of that reduction in staff numbers must go on.  There will be no general resumption in public service recruitment although recruitment will continue in areas of particular need.  The Government have also decided that existing vacancies in the <Col N="1061" /> Civil Service, the filling of which have not been authorised, are to be suppressed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Departments and individual managers in Departments should have much greater flexibility in the use of administrative resources.  That is why I have introduced fixed overall budgets for the cost of administration. That system was introduced in the Department of Social Welfare in the middle of 1990.  The Government have decided that this approach should be extended to all Departments by 1 March next.</P>
      <P>What it means is that the head of each Department will know the total amount of money available to run the organisation for the years 1991-93.  He, or she, will have much greater freedom in the management of resources than in the past, and will have to achieve specified reductions in the cost of running the Department in those years.  The great advantage of this approach is that it allows each Department to develop a more efficient and effective management style while ensuring that the overall cost of running the Civil Service is reduced in real terms.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Public Service Pay</i>
      </P>
      <P>The White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure included £3,419 million in respect of the 1991 Exchequer pay and pensions bill.  This figure includes the cost of the first phase &mdash; 4 per cent from 1 January &mdash; of the general pay increases provided for in the Draft Agreement on Pay and Conditions.  It also includes a contingency provision to meet the cost of a number of emerging special pay increases which will fall to be met under the elaboration of the 1987 public service pay agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The further expenditure additions I have just announced, and the review of 1991 spending allocations I mentioned earlier, will increase, marginally, the cost <Col N="1062" /> of the Exchequer pay and pensions bill to £3,422 million.  This is an increase of just over 8 per cent on the 1990 outturn of £3,161 million.  The Government are deeply concerned at the rising costs of the Exchequer pay and pensions bill.  These costs reflect the Government's willingness, for the sake of stability and industrial peace, to take on board increases arising both from the existing pay agreement and from the new draft pay agreement under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> That draft agreement sets clearly defined limits to future pay increases in both the public and private sectors.  The Government are determined to ensure that these limits will be strictly adhered to in respect of public service employees.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Post-Budget Expenditure Provisions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The net result of the new expenditures and initiatives I have just announced is to add just over £81 million to non-capital supply services in 1991, bringing the total to £6,222 million and they add £11 million to the opening Public Capital Programme bringing it to £1,833 million.  As I have said, details of the adjustments can be found in the Principal Features of the Budget.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <b>REVENUE</b>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>What are our main aims for tax reform over the next few years?  Let us start with income tax.  We want to reduce the standard rate to 25 per cent by 1993 while moving towards a single higher rate, as stated in our Programme for Government; and we want to relieve the burden on people on low pay by reducing the standard rate and increasing income exemptions and child relief.  That is income tax, but there are other taxes too.</P>
    <P>We must aim to bring our indirect tax rates and coverage into line with prospective EC requirements as quickly as possible, and as part of that to remove VAT at point of entry; we need an increased yield from capital taxation and the corporate sector.  A major contribution here will be the radical reform and streamlining of company taxation <Col N="1063" /> implemented in recent years; we have to constantly improve tax administration and enforcement; and, finally, we need to broaden the taxation base generally, in order to support the revenue yield and so give us room to move.</P>
    <P>It is the task of Government to judge what steps are appropriate and affordable in the coming year to achieve all this.  It would not make sense to seek progress on the taxation front, if this were to put the balance of the public finances at risk. Our medium-term taxation strategy demands continued expenditure discipline, side by side with the broadening of the tax base.  It is in the light of all of those considerations that the measures I am proposing have been framed.</P>
    <P>The opening current tax revenue position, as revealed in the Pre-Budget White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure, is £8,385 million.  Obviously, this leaves me little room for manoeuvre, given the overriding need to maintain budgetary discipline.  Even with that limited scope, we have put together a package that accords with our objectives and the needs of the economy and, at the same time, provides a reward for effort, an incentive for enterprise.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Yes, there were severe budgetary constraints in the past few years, but we still managed to make considerable progress on income tax.  The standard rate was brought down to 30 per cent and the top rate to 53 per cent.  There were increases in the personal and PAYE allowances, and extensions of the standard and 48 per cent rate bands.  The tax treatment of the lower paid was also substantially improved, and will be further improved this year as I have already indicated.</P>
    <P>I propose to continue the process of general income tax reform, which I started in 1989.  The existing standard rate of 30 per cent will be reduced to 29 per cent.  This rate will also apply to the withholding tax on professional fees and to the deposit interest retention tax.  The standard rate tax band is being widened: from £13,000 to £13,400 for a married <Col N="1064" /> couple and from £6,500 to £6,700 for a single person.  The personal allowance is being increased from £4,100 to £4,200 for a married couple and from £2,050 to £2,100 for a single person, with comparable increases in the widowed, single parent and widowed parent allowances. The top rate of tax is being reduced from 53 per cent to 52 per cent.  I am also renewing the PRSI allowance for a further year, at a 1991 cost of £36 million.</P>
    <P>Let me give some specifics of how people will gain: a single person on PAYE with an income of £10,000 will gain up to £127; a married couple with an income of £16,000 will gain up to £137; and a married couple with an income of £20,000 will gain up to £254.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Take-Home Pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>Take-home pay increased considerably in real terms under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> This contrasts sharply with the decline earlier in the eighties. The recent improvement in workers living standards came from a combination of moderate wage increases, low inflation and income tax reductions.  It is a formula we can repeat.</P>
    <P>We got it right the last time, and we can now get it right under the new programme. The pay element is contained in the programme itself.  Low inflation is a reality.  The tax concessions I have announced form the third element.  I have concessions mean a further real increase this year in take-home pay for workers getting the 1991 pay terms proposed in the programme.  For PAYE workers on the average industrial wage, the increase in net take-home pay will be comfortably over 4 per cent when pay increase and income tax concessions are combined. Low paid workers with families will do best, proportionately, and that is the way it should be.  What is more, they can benefit from the family income supplement improvements I have already outlined.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmers Income Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am proposing a number of specific developmental measures in the area of farming taxation consistent with what is envisaged in the new programme.</P>

      <Col N="1065" />
      <i>Leasing Income</i>
    </P>
    <P>Land mobility is important, so is the productive use of land.  To encourage both, I have decided to increase the annual exemption for certain income derived from the leasing of farmland.  The amount of lease income qualifying for exemption is being raised to £3,000 for qualifying leases given from today. Where such leases are given for seven or more years duration, an exemption of £4,000 will apply.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stock Relief for Farmers</i>
    </P>
    <P>The present system of stock relief for farmers is being renewed for a further two years.  This will complement policy measures to maintain stock levels, and will be of particular help to developing farmers.  The cost of the renewal of stock relief in 1991 is £0.9 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmyard Pollution</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have decided, as an exceptional measure, that the 50 per cent rate of accelerated capital allowances, will be continued for two years for investment to deal with farmyard pollution. This extension will apply to spending within the existing Department of Agriculture and Food grant schemes for controlling farmyard pollution.  This expenditure is going to qualify for the allowances on a net-of-grant basis where incurred before 1 April 1993 and approved under these schemes.  This incentive will help farmers to make the investment needed in anti-pollution measures and it will help protect our precious environment.  The estimated cost is £3 million in 1991 and £5 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Income Tax Measures Rent Relief For Over 55s</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am increasing the ceiling on relief for rent paid by taxpayers aged 55 or older. The ceiling now is £750 for single and widowed people and £1,500 for married couples.  I am raising that to £1,000 for single people and to £2,000 for married couples, and also I am introducing a new ceiling for widowed people of £1,500.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" />
      <i>Widowed Parents With Dependent Children</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been concerned for some time about the position of married taxpayers after the death of a spouse where there is one or more dependent children.  The income tax code already provides some recognition for widowed parents; their basic allowances are made equivalent to those of married couples.  That is good, but not good enough, given the real trauma of the period following bereavement. I am introducing a special allowance for widowed parents with dependent children, to apply for the three tax years following that in which their spouse died. The allowance will be £1,500 in the tax year following bereavement, £1,000 in the next year and £500 in the year after that.  A point to note is that a parent of dependent children whose spouse has died since 6 April last will benefit from the £1,500 allowance in the 1991-92 tax year.  I am personally pleased to be able to introduce this new allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>PAYE Allowance For Cross-Frontier Workers</i>
    </P>
    <P>People employed and taxed under a PAYE type system in another jurisdiction &mdash; an issue brought to my notice by politicians on both sides of the Border &mdash; and also taxed here in respect of that employment, do not, at the moment, qualify for the PAYE allowance.  I am proposing to grant the allowance where the employment is of the kind that, if within the State, would qualify for the allowance.  The people who will mainly benefit from this are people living in this State but employed in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cost Of Reliefs</i>
    </P>
    <P>The total cost of the income tax reliefs, including those I announced earlier, comes to just over £85 million in the current year; in a full year, the estimated cost is £145 million.  This excludes the cost of renewing PRSI relief.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Base Broadening</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have had to look to specific reliefs in the tax code for a contribution to the cost of the further reductions in income tax <Col N="1067" /> rates.  This is consistent with our stated objectives and is within the spirit of tax reform.  Reform means, in essence, widening the tax base in order to reduce personal income tax rates.  This is important for competitiveness, for incentives, and ultimately for job-creation, which is the Government's primary concern. There is a growing international consensus that countries are best served by low rates of tax with a minimum of specialist reliefs and concessions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Life Assurance Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>The tax relief on life assurance costs nearly £18 million in the current year and that is in spite of its curtailment in recent years, to 80 per cent and then to 50 per cent of its previous level.  Since it is still distorting financial investment, I am reducing the 50 per cent further to 25 per cent in respect of all premiums paid on or after 6 April next.</P>
    <P>I am not changing mortgage interest relief.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business Expansion Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The cost of the business expansion scheme relief is high.  It has been high in recent years, despite the action taken in successive Finance Acts to curb abuses. It is estimated to have cost around £40 million in tax foregone by the Exchequer in the 1989-90 tax year and it will cost a similar amount in the present tax year if action is not taken.</P>
    <P>The scheme was all about helping smaller companies in need of seed capital, a valid aim.  Small companies have an important role to play in expanding the economy's productive base and, of course, in creating additional self-sustaining jobs.  Equity as opposed to borrowing is the best source of capital for such companies but may be difficult to get because of the risk involved.  The BES aims to make it easier for small companies to raise equity.  Accordingly, the Government have decided to extend the scheme &mdash; due to expire on 5 April next &mdash; for a further two years.</P>
    <P>The changes I have made in the BES over the past few years have sought to <Col N="1068" /> curb abuses and focus the scheme more clearly on what it is supposed to be doing. It was never the intention that it should provide income tax relief for investment in secure asset-backed ventures involving little risk, but the reality is that this is frequently how it is operating and in the process, it is creating an unacceptable tax-shelter.</P>
    <P>In order to reduce the cost in tax foregone and to focus the scheme more effectively, I am introducing some changes: the scheme will no longer apply to shipping, hotels, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation.  It will, of course, continue to apply to manufacturing and international services, special trading houses and advance factories, and to tourist facilities other than those I have mentioned; the total amount a company can raise under the scheme will in future be limited to £0.5 million; and the amount any taxpayer can claim relief on will have a &ldquo;lifetime cap&rdquo; on it of £50,000.  Where a company or individual has already passed the new limits, there will be no claw-back, but amounts raised or invested up to yesterday will, of course, count towards these limits.  These restrictions will apply to all shares issued on and from today. There will be no exceptions, not even where subscriptions have already been sought prior to the introduction of these restrictions.</P>
    <P>As well as that, I am planning to include an additional provision in the Finance Bill.  This will ensure that where a self-employed taxpayer is basing his preliminary tax payment for the 1991-92 tax year on 100 per cent of his liability for 1990-91, such payment must exclude the effect of any BES investment he may have made in the 1990-91 tax year.  Otherwise, such a taxpayer would be gaining on two fronts; getting the benefit of a 1990-91 BES investment in that tax year, and at the same time, using it to reduce his preliminary tax payment due in November 1991, for the 1991-92 tax year. Such a facility would not be available to a PAYE taxpayer who had a BES investment in 1990-91.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" />
      <i>Relief for Rented Residential Accommodation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Section 23 &mdash; the incentive for the provision of residential accommodation for renting &mdash; has been around in one form or another since 1981.  The Government have decided that this relief will no longer be available after March 1992, with one special exception.</P>
    <P>This one year extension is intended solely as a transitional measure.  It means that projects in the course of construction and projects at the planning stage, can still get moving &mdash; but with a clear understanding that 31 March 1992 is the final deadline.</P>
    <P>The only exception I am making is for the designated areas.  Qualifying expenditures there will attract the relief until 1993.  This should help to promote investment in the provision of residential accommodation in those areas.  That is a good way of redressing the imbalance in the designated areas &mdash; an imbalance currently favouring purely commercial development.</P>
    <P>This initiative will help to create living communities in our cities and towns &mdash; and that is how we should define &ldquo;urban renewal&rdquo;. You cannot have real urban renewal without the presence of people, without the presence of a living community. As an incentive to restore buildings, the existing relief for refurbishment will be broadened from today. This will let refurbishment expenditure in designated areas be offset against all rental income.  At the moment, such expenditure can be offset against the rental income from the refurbished property only.</P>
    <P>Both reliefs will apply in the designated areas up to 31 May 1993, except in the case of the Custom House Docks area, where they will apply up to 25 January 1993.  The cost of these measures is tentatively estimated at £1.5 million in 1991, and £4 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Abuse or Tax Reliefs for Property Investment</i>
    </P>
    <P>There are a number of schemes being planned with a view to enabling the tax <Col N="1070" /> incentives available on the construction of certain buildings to be transferred by way of special arrangements to a large number of investors.  Bluntly, these schemes are trying to use reliefs in a totally unintended and unacceptable way.  Not only that, they would have a considerable upfront cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>If there are any doubts that the application of existing law prohibits the relief sought under the schemes, those doubts will be removed by the inclusion in the Finance Bill of an appropriate provision with effect on and from today.</P>
    <P>This provision will restrict the scope of the tax incentives involved, so that in the case of such schemes they apply only to rental income from the property in question.  If any other schemes of this nature come to light, I will not have any hesitation in taking similar action.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Overall Effect of Income Tax Measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>The package of income tax reliefs I have announced today will benefit all taxpayers. Low-paid taxpayers will benefit particularly from the exemption limit and child addition improvements.  As well as that, employees supporting families on low incomes will benefit from the enhanced family income supplement scheme.  The standard rate is being cut for the third year in succession.  The top rate is also being reduced.  Personal allowances and the standard rate band are being increased.  The marginal income tax rate for nearly 700,000 taxpayers will fall.  Add all these tax reliefs to the pay provisions and the inescapable bottom line of this budget is that workers will see their living standards improve again this year.  This is tangible progress, progress that makes a difference to every taxpayer, progress &mdash; even in a year of considerable budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate, moreover, that our longer term objectives in regard to income tax remain; the Government's aim will be to reduce both the standard and top rates of income tax by 2 per cent in each of the next two years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" />
      <i>Corporation Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The impact of the major reforms in the corporation tax code since 1988 will be spread over the next few years.  Consequently, I am not proposing any further changes this year &mdash; except for the banking sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of Banks</i>
    </P>
    <P>Section 84 loans were restricted by measures in 1989 and 1990, and, as a result, the corporation tax yield from the banks was increased.  But this objective can be frustrated by the growth of high interest rate foreign-currency loans sourced through domestic banks.  They are much more costly to the Exchequer than Irish pound section 84 loans.  To deal with this, I am now introducing a specific measure.  On and from today, no domestic-sourced section 84 loan in foreign currency, either new or rolled-over, will be allowed where the interest rate on the loan exceeds a specified percentage of the existing three-month DIBOR rate. Details are in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Bank Levy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The bank levy is being renewed at its 1990 level of £36 million.  I have decided, however, to set up a special working group of officials of my Department and representatives of the banks to examine corporation tax applying to banks and the role of the levy.  The results of this examination will be with me before the 1992 budget, and at that point, I will look at this matter again.</P>
    <P>
      <i>IFSC</i>
    </P>
    <P>The International Financial Services Centre in Dublin is a major success story, with over 150 projects now approved. The time limit for approvals of new firms setting up business in the IFSC has been extended to end-1994.  I am extending the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for companies in the centre to 31 December 2005.  Analogous arrangements will apply <Col N="1072" /> to companies in the Shannon customs-free airport zone.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Taxes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Exchequer has been doing better out of capital taxes in recent years.  The Government are committed to seeking a further increase, while having regard to wider issues.  We have decided on a series of measures to help achieve this objective.  I will also address concerns about the impact of capital acquisitions tax in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Gains Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Self-assessment is being extended to capital gains tax, so as to speed up assessment and collection.  As a result, we expect to collect an extra £9 million in capital gains tax in 1991.  The necessary provisions will be in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Acquisitions Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Though capital acquisitions tax is already on an effective self-assessment basis, there is a need to introduce some further improvements in administration. I am putting the Revenue Commissioners' enforcement powers in this area on the same footing as their powers related to income tax and corporation tax under self-assessment: the power to attach certain financial assets of defaulters will be extended to capital acquisitions tax; the Revenue sheriffs will be given power to enforce capital acquisitions tax liabilities; and audit procedures under the self-assessment system will be intensified.  The Government have also decided that an amnesty like that of 1988 should operate this year for capital acquisitions tax.  CAT was not included in the 1988 amnesty, which preceded introduction of more stringent enforcement measures for the taxes involved.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers will have a once-off chance to pay, before 30 September next, all outstanding CAT liabilities without penalties <Col N="1073" /> and certain interest payments.  The amnesty will also extend to outstanding estate duty liabilities.  Full details and conditions of the amnesty will be available from the Capital Taxes Branch of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The new enforcement measures will come into effect from 1 October next on the termination of the amnesty.  They will be rigorously implemented.  Having considered the practical operation of CAT, the Government have also decided upon certain structural changes.  We have concluded that no useful purpose is served by the top two rates.  They only come into play in a tiny minority of cases, and may be counterproductive in terms of total yield.  The top rate of CAT in future will be 40 per cent.  The present structure of thresholds and rates will otherwise be retained.</P>
    <P>I am making a few other modifications to CAT, in order: to mitigate the undue burden that can arise in certain circumstances for taxpayers with limited financial resources; to facilitate necessary structural change in agriculture; and to enable people to make provision for an anticipated future liability to gift tax. Therefore, the rate of agricultural relief goes up to 55 per cent, though the present ceiling of £200,000 will be retained.  At the same time, the qualifying conditions will be amended to more closely match the objective, which is to facilitate farm transfers.  There will be a provision in the Finance Bill to ease the burden that can arise where a dwelling is transferred between elderly brothers or sisters living there together.  Furthermore, &ldquo;Section 60&rdquo; insurance policies, now confined to the payment of inheritance tax, will be extended to cover gift tax liability.</P>
    <P>The CAT changes, with the exception of the change in the qualifying conditions for agricultural relief, will apply with effect from, and including, today; the provisions necessary to give effect to them will be included in the Finance Bill. Overall, the effect of this capital acquisition tax package &mdash; including the amnesty &mdash; should be to increase the expected yield in 1991 by £5 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" />
      <i>Indirect Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Turning now to indirect taxes, the challenges Europe will pose after 1992 must be squarely faced.  There are 700 days left before the deadline.  That is what remains before the completion of the Single Market.  After that point, things will never be the same for any of us.  The indirect tax measures I am about to announce are another instalment of the adjustment we must make for participation in the new Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Standard Rate of VAT</i>
    </P>
    <P>To move us more into line with our Community partners, I am reducing the 23 per cent standard VAT rate from 1 March by 2 percentage points to 21 per cent.  This is the rate applying to most consumer and household goods, and the change brings us closer to the 14-20 per cent rate envisaged by the EC Commission. It does more, it further reduces the potential for cross-Border distortions of trade.  But what about the extent to which VAT reductions are passed on to consumers?  Last year, some businesses were slow to reduce prices following the VAT cut.  I do not want that to happen this year, and I will be working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to see that the customer gets the full benefit.</P>
    <P>Responsible action by the business community is good for the business community. Consumers should support outlets that quickly reflect VAT reductions in their prices.  And where that quick reflection does not happen, it must inevitably influence the Government's long term approach to this whole area.</P>
    <P>Because of the high cost of reducing the standard VAT rate, I must look for compensating revenue increases from other indirect taxes, including VAT.</P>
    <P>At present, less than 40 per cent of all consumer goods and services attract the standard rate of VAT.  The thrust of current EC policy is to significantly increase this share, and I have decided that now is the time to get this process under way. Therefore, with effect from 1 March, the low rate of 10 per cent will be increased to 12.5 per cent on a wide range of items. Fuel for heating, light and power will <Col N="1075" /> be affected, as will telecommunications, personal services, repair and maintenance services and adults clothing and footwear.  I am making an exception for building, hotel accommodation, short term car, boat and caravan hire, tour guide services and newspapers.  Until final decisions are taken on these at EC level, they will stay at the 10 per cent level of tax.  The net cost to the Exchequer of what I have announced will be £37 million in 1991.  The estimated full year cost is similar.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Minor VAT Changes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The forthcoming Finance Bill will introduce the taxation, from 1 January 1992, at 12.5 per cent, of veterinary services &mdash; because this is now required by EC law.  It will also see an extension of the definition of &ldquo;hotels&rdquo; to eradicate some anomalies in current practice which militate against legitimate operators, and the taxation of some non-postal services of An Post, to, remove competitive distortions &mdash; for example with Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Excise Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>With one exception &mdash; tobacco &mdash; I am maintaining the restrained approach of recent years to the application of duty increases to excisable goods.  The old reliables will remain free for another year.  The main reason I am making an exception of tobacco is because, having declined steadily for a number of years, the consumption of cigarettes went up in both 1989 and 1990.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, is profoundly concerned about this.  I am increasing the tax on a packet of 20 cigarettes by 10p, inclusive of VAT, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for other tobacco products, with effect from midnight tonight.  The excise duty will be further increased with effect from 1 March so as to leave the retail price unaffected by the standard rate VAT reduction.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Liquified Petroleum Gas</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am cutting the excise duty on auto LPG further by 8 pence per gallon from 1 <Col N="1076" /> March, to keep it competitive with other road fuels in the light of the VAT changes.  I will be arranging in the Finance Bill for a reduction of 15 pence per gallon on the duty on LPG used in horticulture, to bring it into line with the equivalent duty applicable to heating oil.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Road Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Nineteen eighty-three was the last time road tax on goods vehicles was changed. Nineteen eighty-six was the last time the road tax on private cars went up.  Since then, the real values of the duty rates have been considerably eroded, so I am increasing them by about 10 per cent on average, effective from 1 April 1991.</P>
    <P>I will also take the opportunity to streamline the rating structure, particularly as it affects goods vehicles.  The recent inordinate growth in the number of small goods vehicles suggests that the concessionary tax regime in regard to excise duty and road tax is being taken advantage of for private motoring.  To preserve road tax revenue, and to be fair to car owners, I have introduced a new minimum rate &mdash; and the details are in &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Veteran Cars</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am introducing a concessionary rate of road tax of £25 for vehicles over 30 years old.</P>

      <i>Travellers Allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>Since the decision of the European Court of Justice on the &ldquo;48 hour rule&rdquo;, the Government have been seeking to negotiate arrangements giving protection against large-scale cross-Border trade distortions.  On 17 December last, unanimous agreement was reached by the Council of Finance Ministers that both Ireland and Denmark should be granted the short term derogations they sought. We plan to put the new provisions in place as soon as we can complete discussions with the European Commission on the specifics of the derogation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Post-Budget Current Revenue Position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The net cost to the Exchequer, in 1991, of the taxation measures I have outlined is £50 million.  When this, and the £23 million revenue buoyancy arising from the totality of the measures announced today are taken into account, the post-budget tax revenue estimate comes to £8,358 million.  When non-tax revenue is added, the total comes to £8,774 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BUDGET OBJECTIVES</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current Budget Deficit and Exchequer Borrowing</i>
    </P>
    <P>Taking account of all the measures I have announced today, the estimate for the current budget deficit in 1991 is £245 million or 1.0 per cent of GNP, and that for the Exchequer borrowing requirement is £460 million or 1.9 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Borrowing is now in line with the norm for our Community partners participating in the narrow-band of the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. Of course, this has to be seen against the background of an exceptionally high ratio of debt to GNP, which the Government are determined to reduce progressively.</P>
    <P>In the medium term, we have to accommodate certain priority expenditures, and we face pressures on tax revenues, both from EC harmonisation and the need to relieve income tax.  This reinforces the imperative to keep current expenditure on a tight rein.</P>
    <P>The longer term aim must be to phase out borrowing altogether, while having <Col N="1078" /> regard to economic and budgetary realities. Controlling our borrowing will be the basis for tackling all our other economic challenges.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Irish Life PLC</i>
    </P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Government have decided to reduce their shareholding in Irish Life from 90 per cent to 34 per cent through a share flotation. The first steps in the process have been completed &mdash; the restructuring of Irish Life Assurance PLC and the creation of a new holding company, Irish Life, PLC. The flotation of Irish Life, PLC is planned to take place this year.</P>
    <P>It would not be prudent to comment now on prospective share values, so I have not provided in the budgetary arithmetic for the sale proceeds although they will serve to reduce substantially our actual borrowing and the eventual EBR for 1991.  What I can say &mdash; as I made plain in this House in July &mdash; is that the sale proceeds will be used to reduce borrowing and thus help to ease the burden of the national debt and of debt-servicing costs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>This has been an exceptionally difficult budget to prepare.  There are few external certainties, and at home we must await adoption of the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for the added certainty about domestic stability that we so badly need.</P>
    <P>I have had to keep constantly in mind the overriding need to persevere with strict overall discipline in the public finances.  We have come too far, and there is too much at stake, for us to contemplate any deviation in this regard.</P>
    <P>Thanks to the new programme, we have now got a broader agenda for progress than we could have had a few years ago.  Back then, our difficulties, and the budgetary problems underlying them, dominated all our thinking.</P>
    <P>Now, we have tasted success.  We have reasserted our capacity to compete and develop.  We have positioned ourselves with a new confidence, to grasp the <Col N="1079" /> opportunities of an expanding marketplace.</P>
    <P>This budget &mdash; supports measures to tackle unemployment; outlines new initiatives in health, housing, education and in agriculture, it increases welfare benefits not just in line with, but ahead of, inflation; it makes progress on the tax reform front and gives real benefits to taxpayers; it helps the less well-off.  This budget brings us a step further towards European integration; it makes our economy more competitive; it continues tight control of our public finances; it lays the groundwork for the delivery of more benefits in later years; and it clearly flags investors that this Government's policy is geared to create the right climate for business growth and development.  It gives us a sound basis for the year ahead but if any of the various imponderables <Col N="1080" /> should develop unfavourably, the Government will not be slow to take whatever action is needed.</P>
    <P>There is now a wide consensus in our society on the goals we want to achieve, and on what their achievement demands of us.  The future prosperity and welfare of all our people will be best served by maintaining this consensus and adapting it to changing circumstances.  Now, there is a new realism, and an understanding that there can be no going back, no deviation from the policies of recent years.</P>
    <P>This budget spans the success of the recent past and the challenges of the immediate future.</P>
    <P>This bridging budget is designed to make sure we get the hard-won benefits to which the resolute consistent action of the past few years has entitled us.</P>
    <P>I earnestly urge its endorsement on all concerned.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Níorbh é a locht a laghad ar aon nós.  Budget day, traditionally, is a day of drama in this House.  We have photo calls, the Minister is photographed with his battered brief case arriving at the House and various gurus make predictions on what might be in the budget.  Today that sense of drama is heightened given that this is the first Budget Statement to go out live on television.  I am delighted that all the Fianna Fáil backbenchers have put on their new suits and are looking so well. Indeed, they will look extremely well on television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am afraid that this is a phoney drama.  The drama is more apparent than real because there is nothing in the budget that we did not know already.  There was a time when the Minister for Finance came into the House on budget day and announced fundamental policy changes which affected the future of the country and when the admonitions of the Ceann Comhairle on budgetary secrecy meant something but the Minister came into the House today with a budget the details of which were widely known for the last week and not simply because of the leaks on the budget.  In terms of leaks, this must be the wettest Government ever.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Taoiseach wants to call the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, PESP which is a dramatic name in keeping with his attitude to marketing.  He could well call the budget the MILDEW &mdash; the most intentionally leaked document ever in the world &mdash; as we knew every detail of it before the Minister came into the House. It could be called that name for another reason because it is going to have an extremely corrosive effect on national life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Modern budgets, even if the details are not leaked, are not dramatic.  We are aware before budget day how the Minister intends spending approximately 98 pence out of every pound.  Therefore, it comes down to a matter of what a Minister <Col N="1092" /> will do with £200 million or £250 million out of a budget in excess of £9 billion.  Furthermore, we know in far greater detail since last week when agreement was reached on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> what the intentions of the Government are.  We knew last December that the Government were planning a budget three times the rate of inflation and we know, since the announcement of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, and the conclusion of negotiations with the social partners, what the details of public expenditure will be.</P>
    <P>I have begun my contribution in this way to demystify the budgetary process. There is something else I want to say to Members on all sides of the House and that is that I do not think it is a good idea that the House should merely assemble on budget day to rubber stamp decisions which have been taken elsewhere.  I do not think the House should be reduced to the level of a rubber stamp in relation to decisions taken by other people regardless of the merits of those who have taken them.  A very important principle is involved here.  Article 17 of the Constitution places an obligation on this House to consider the Estimates on an annual basis and to make a decision on them.  On this occasion, however, we will not give them any consideration; they will be presented to us, and the Government majority will walk through the lobbies having given them little consideration. As a matter of principle, that is fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <P>I am not against the idea of wage agreements by consensus or with the social partners participating in the negotiations but if the consensus is to mean anything it needs to be broadened, deepened and widened and this House must be involved.  That applies to everybody on this side of the House and to the backbenchers on the Government side.  We are nearing the point when this House will have no say, and the day which used to be the most dramatic in the history of Dáil Éireann, budget day, will be no more than a day on which the drama is spurious and the news limited as the real <Col N="1093" /> decisions will be made elsewhere.  As a matter of principle, the Taoiseach should seek to involve the leaders and the representatives of the Opposition parties, either through the NESC or otherwise, if this consensus approach is to continue.</P>
    <P>We have had wage agreements before and I have no problem with them being negotiated by those who represent the interests of those at the negotiating table but this agreement is fundamentally different. Not only is it a three year agreement but it seeks to underpin policy on public services for the decade.  As a matter of principle, this House should be involved and should not be asked simply to rubber stamp it.  I accept the bona fides of everybody at the negotiating table and even if the Taoiseach rejects my argument that it should be done as a matter of principle there is a sound pragmatic reason for my suggestion.  There has been a change of Government following each general election since 1969.  If the fundamentals of a consensus approach to the economy are to survive throughout the decade this House has to be involved in that decision-making process and in underpinning the fundamentals.</P>
    <P>Despite the Taoiseach's intimations on political immortality, Governments will change, and when he faces the electorate again there will be a change of Government. It would be wise to have any consensus approach which is supposed to span a decade in matters as fundamental as matters of public expenditure to be endorsed by a wider group of people than the 15 people in the Cabinet negotiating with the social partners.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for the social partners. They represent the interests of their members very well indeed, but who actually is represented at the table?  Who represents the parents of the mentally handicapped child in the negotiations? Who represents the mother of six children whose husband is on long term unemployment?  Who represents the Irish boys sleeping rough in London?  Who represents the thousands of emigrants in every city we can name across the Western world?  I suggest the people in this <Col N="1094" /> House represent them.  We meet them every day in our clinics.  We get their representations all the time and I think the consensus approach, if it is to last, certainly will have to be widened and deepened.  I accept the bona fides of the social partners.  I think they do an excellent job for their members but the interests of those who are not represented at the table are not very high on the list of priorities of the people negotiating.</P>
    <P>When we take away what we knew already from the Book of Estimates, when we factor in what was leaked in regard to this budget and when we read the details of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> we find that what we have here today is a speech which took the Minister an hour and a half, full of sound and fury, to read but which signifies nothing.  It is dramatic only in one respect in its failure, its failure to take decisions, its failure to address the real problems of the country, its failure to take the national case one iota forward from what it was yesterday.</P>
    <P>We are all very familiar now with a new vocabulary of war and the Minister for Finance today has launched a Scud missile into the Irish economy.  There are military experts now everywhere you go. It is impossible to buy a pint without meeting military experts, but all will recall that the Scud missile is a very imprecise type of weapon.  It has the capacity to make noise, to terrify, even to kill, but it lacks targeting, I tell the Minister, and its effect from a strategic point of view is very limited indeed.  We all know in this House that the twin problems facing us are unemployment and emigration, yet in this budget there is not one specific measure which will lead to one extra job in the country.  As a matter of fact, one of the great ironies was when the programme for the decade was announced on Tuesday of last week: on Friday the Minister pulled out the White Paper and had to revise the figures for unemployment.  After the programme was published the figures for the live register had to be estimated upwards from 221,000 to 228,000 and I believe they are still underestimated.  Certainly <Col N="1095" /> this budget will have an adverse effect on employment.  It will not create a single job.  We all know the answer to the problems of unemployment and emigration. We must create jobs, and the fundamental fault in this budget with all its one and a half hours of detail, all its tricking around, all its taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another, is that there is not a single strategy in it which will create a single job.</P>
    <P>I always think the present Government led by the Taoiseach are like a group of cartoon figures trying to start an old banger of a car which is up on blocks.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This budget is based on very shaky foundations. We warned the Government in this House last year that they were expanding too fast, spending too much in the 1990 budget, that it would run them into difficulties, that the limited success in the economy was due to the buoyancy of revenue and that changing circumstances domestically and internationally would take away some of that buoyancy.  They succeeded in coming out <Col N="1096" /> of 1990 with respectable figures because of the buoyancy of revenue but now they are faced with changing international circumstances and their problems are much more difficult.  They are hoping that their estimates here which are increasing expenditure by three times the rate of inflation will be covered again by a buoyancy or revenue but that is to assume a growth in the economy which no independent economist would agree with. The Government are claiming there will be 2.25 per cent growth in the economy. I believe they will not get that.</P>
      <P>We all know there is a war on.  We do not know how long the war will last but we know what the effects of war are. First, people get nervous in war times, even non-participating nations.  They tend to save more and spend less.  People who make investment decisions tend to defer the investment decisions until the war is over or until they see a possibility of its ending.  Increased savings and reduced investment are going to lead to a situation where the flow of revenue which is calculated here by the Minister will not come back to the Exchequer.  I believe the Minister is seriously over-estimating the amount of revenue which will come into the Exchequer in 1991.  I think he knows that and his officials know it also but when they were faced with the problem of what to factor in from a war they decided, as economists sometimes do, to assume there was no war at all and to proceed as if there was no war and they can correct it later.  I mentioned that we were all becoming familiar with military terminology now, watching TV frequently and hearing our friends discussing the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the allied nations were bombing Iraq intensely in the first days of the war there was a great deal of surprise that the Iraqis were not retaliating.  I saw an American general suggesting one night that this was probably a &ldquo;rope a dope&rdquo; strategy.  A &ldquo;rope a dope&rdquo; strategy was a new one on me but I think this is a &ldquo;rope a dope&rdquo; budget because it is gulling the taxpayer and making certain assumptions about growth which are not valid in present international circumstances.  We <Col N="1097" /> already have the threat towards the end of the Minister's speech that he will introduce a supplementary budget if necessary later in the year.  This &ldquo;rope a dope&rdquo; strategy will fall apart.  I suppose it will last until the local elections but once the local elections are over we will see what will happen.  Even if we accept the figures the Minister has given at face value, he has an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £460 million.  Do you know this will add £7,660 to the national debt for every child who will be born in 1991? That is some birthday present for the children of 1991.  I would say it will nearly cancel out the sixpence a day increase in children's allowance which the Minister is giving to each child in his adjustments to child benefit.</P>
    <P>These are the kind of problems we face in this budget.  It is based on very shaky foundations.  I am doubtful if the Minister will achieve the targets he has outlined today because the assumptions on which the budget is based are over-optimistic and seen to be over-optimistic by every independent economist, and, I strongly suspect, his own people in the Department of Finance because they, not being able to factor in the depressing effect of the war at this stage decided to ignore it for the time being and advise the Minister that he can take corrective measures in mid-summer if corrective measures are necessary.</P>
    <P>It has been fashionable over the last few days to criticise public service pay, to blame the increase in public service pay for the difficulties in which the Minister finds himself.  We should examine that criticism because there is a lot of begrudgery towards the public service. We should ask ourselves: who are we talking about anyway?  We are talking about teachers, the Garda Síochána, civil servants, firemen, local authority and health board officials, nurses, junior doctors and postmen.  They are not some kind of saboteurs ganging up to undermine the national interests.  Yet some recent comment would suggest that they were irresponsible people grabbing more than they were fairly entitled to.  I do not agree with that contention for one <Col N="1098" /> minute.  The reason there is a problem with public service pay this year is that the negotiations in the pay agreement in 1987 deferred public service pay special increases.  They all accumulated, snowballed, and must be paid in 1990 and 1991.</P>
    <P>I blame the Government for exaggerating the progress they made in controlling the public debt, for not stating quite clearly that some of that progress was temporary because there were IOUs out there, particularly to public servants, who patriotically and in the national interest, agreed to deferment of their pay increases and who must now receive them.  That is not the problem at all with public service pay.  Rather the problem with the public service, and public service pay, is the lack of a Government policy to reform the public service or do anything at all with it.  Over the last three years the Government, the Minister, and his predecessor, the present EC Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. MacSharry, spent £127 million to buy out 9,500 public servants.  Indeed, they received the lump sum element of that from the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Now we have a programme signed and a Government policy again expanding the public service without any evaluation of the policy that I can perceive.  No private company that would have introduced a redundancy scheme, say, in 1987, 1988 and 1989 to reduce their workforce would begin increasing that workforce without evaluating need or anything else; I say that in terms of lack of reform in the public service.</P>
    <P>A good public servant is worth his or her weight in gold.  I contend that a good teacher, nurse or junior doctor working, say, 80 hours in a hospital is worth anything he or she can be paid.  The problem with the public service at present is that it is almost detached from the real economy. There have been no targets set by the Government or the Minister, no career structure, no merit pay; promotion is still tied into seniority in very many cases.  If people are pointing the finger at the public service then the Government should go back and reform <Col N="1099" /> the public service so that the really able people in the public service get recognition and are not dragged down by a very small minority at whom the finger of criticism can be pointed.  We are all receivers of the services supplied by the public service; public servants themselves receive the services supplied by other public servants.  The increases in public service pay &mdash; especially the special increases &mdash; are justified, fair and give a good reward to public servants.  Now that the suppliers of the services have been rewarded their consumers must be taken into account also.  I call on the Minister to reform the public service in a way which would integrate it fully into our economy, allowing all those very able people who man our public services play their full role in national life.</P>
    <P>I say that by way of preliminary to the details of the budget proper.  We should remember we are talking today about £250 million out of a total budget of £9 billion.  Many of the issues which will affect our national life for years to come have already been decided outside this House and it is appropriate to refer to them in this context.</P>
    <P>I should like to move now to some of the specifics of the budget and look first at income tax.  In the first instance it is fair to recite what the Minister has done. He has reduced the top income tax rate by 1 per cent, from 53 per cent to 52 per cent, but has not touched the 48 per cent rate.  The Minister has reduced the standard rate of income tax from 30 per cent to 29 per cent; that is fair enough so far. Then he goes on to remove the ceiling on the health contribution which means that 1.25 per cent is added to everybody's total salary.  To date, health contributions were paid up to a ceiling of approximately £16,500 and now it will be paid on the full tranche of income.  Therefore, if we are talking about marginal rates of income tax we must now add back 1.25 per cent; so we deduct 1 per cent and we add back 1.25 per cent.  This means that a person on the 53 per cent band goes down to 52 per cent but, out of the other pocket, he goes back up to 53.25 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> That is no reduction in the marginal rate of tax.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the position of people on the 48 per cent income tax band.  If we look at the ceiling, cut-off point, we see that people on the 48 per cent rate will exceed the present ceiling for health contribution.  This means that henceforth they will pay, on the last tranche of their income, a marginal rate of 49.25 per cent. Therefore, the Minister is actually increasing the rate on those most affected &mdash; that is middle income people &mdash; who are being sucked into that 49 per cent band at much too low a level and whose marginal rate is being increased.</P>
    <P>The Minister does another couple of things as well.  He indexes the bands. When one calculates what he does with the bands it amounts to an adjustment of about 3 per cent.  He says inflation will be approximately 3 per cent for 1991 and, for the sake of argument, we will accept his figures.  He does not index the personal allowances which are increasing by slightly more than 2 per cent, which is less than indexation.  The public really are interested in the bottom line only; they do not fully understand the complex manner in which their tax is calculated. The PAYE allowance of £800 and the PRSI allowance of £286 are not indexed; there is no allowance made for inflation there.  Therefore, when one combines the bands, the personal allowances, the PRSI and PAYE allowances, one realises this amounts to a lot less than indexation. This means that the taxpayer who would normally expect that his allowances and bands would be lifted automatically for inflation purposes has this kind of fiscal drag and brake put on to claw back what he had had formerly.</P>
    <P>In addition the relief on life insurance premiums is being reduced from 50 per cent to 25 per cent, affecting everybody; it is now difficult to find the head of a household who is not insured.  Whether that householder be taxed at the standard, middle or high rate that relief is reduced.  When one takes into account the swings and roundabouts there is neither tax reduction nor tax reform.  I am concerned particularly about the 48 <Col N="1101" /> per cent rate.  The arguments advanced, particularly by the Progressive Democrats, if they apply at all apply more to the 48 per cent rate than to the other. People move from the standard rate of income tax to the 48 per cent rate at too low an income.  The disincentive in the economy is not that the standard rate of income tax was 30 per cent and is being reduced to 29 per cent; it is not that one's overtime earnings will be charged at 29 per cent rather than 30 per cent or that one's Christmas bonus will be subject to tax at 29 per cent rather than 30 per cent.  The disincentive is that if one does overtime or gets a Christmas bonus, or works harder one will jump from the standard rate of 30 per cent to 48 per cent. Now with the Minister's adjustments one will jump from the standard rate of 29 per cent to 49¼ per cent.  The Minister is increasing the marginal rate where the most damage will be done.  That is not to talk about the merits or demerits of any of the increases or decreases.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for a Minister to beat the figures, because the information is freely available to everybody now.  In the White Paper which the Minister published at midnight last Friday, he estimated that £255 million extra would be taken in income tax, almost all from the PAYE sector in 1991 as against 1990.  The income tax relief amounts to £85 million but including the take-aways it is about half that.  It comes out in my estimation at £54 or £55 million.  The Minister is admitting that he will take £255 million extra in 1991 as against 1990.  That is a tax reform that suits the Minister who thinks that he can blind people with figures and that they will not understand the implications of the ministerial announcements. I can assure the Minister that although people may not be able to follow them in detail or argue them up and down the scale with the Minister, in every factory this evening, they will know what the change means and they will know that in terms of income tax, like everything else, this is a do nothing budget.  At this <Col N="1102" /> stage I wonder what is the role of the Progressive Democrats in Government?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> They were there as a kind of purge on the excesses of Fianna Fáil.  They were to be the corrective factor in the Cabinet.  Yet, they accepted a budget last year which in terms of public expenditure showed a dramatic increase in public spending, certainly an increase which the Fianna Fáil minority Government when Mr. MacSharry was Minister would not have accepted.  Yet, when the Progressive Democrats went in we saw this huge increase in public expenditure.</P>
      <P>From the leaks, we all know that the Minister has gone through another fortnight of trauma looking for expenditure cuts in Cabinet.  Today's news is that there is to be £33 million extra in cuts and £95 million in extra expenditure decisions.  The Minister should have quit while he was ahead in December, because he lost another £65 million by looking for further cuts.  I wonder where the guardians of public expenditure were &mdash; and they are not here now either &mdash; the people who talked tough in this House in Opposition and always voted soft?  Where were they when they were needed?  I thought they would have been there to press the case for tax reform.  Where is the tax reform?  This is the old soft shoe shuffle &mdash; we will give you £85 million extra in income tax relief but we will put 10 per cent onto car tax, 10p onto the packet of cigarettes, we will not index allowances and we will pretend that the PAYE and PRSI allowances are fixed amounts.  We will take away benefit and relief on insurance policies, and then we will increase tax on your clothes and shoes.  This is tax reform, the new tax reform by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  It will not win very many races.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> In relation to indirect taxation the Minister has reduced the standard rate of VAT from 23 per cent to 21 per cent as we expected.  We were told by various commentators that this news had been widely released.  What was less widely known was that the Minister is increasing the lower rate on a selection of items to 12½ per cent to pay for this.  What is Government policy on tax harmonisation? We are supposed to have our taxes harmonised with those in Europe very shortly.  What is the intention? I understood the Commission proposals to be that we would have one high rate at around 15 per cent and a lower rate and that items like food could be exempt and there would not be an EC obligation on us to put VAT on them.  I cannot see that the Minister is doing that or where he intends going.  The Minister is reducing the 23 per cent to 21 per cent. I understand from previous debates in this House that the Minister is contemplating a standard 17 per cent rate.  If this is the Minister's way of doing it, by increasing the lower rate on certain items, are we to presume that in next year's budget the 12½ per cent will go up to meet that and that we will have a rate of 17 per cent?  The idea of harmonisation was that we would have two rates but the Minister has complicated the VAT system by introducing another rate of 12½ per cent.  The Minister has threatened everybody who remains on the 10 per cent rate that if there is a policy change in Europe that will be increased also.  It seems inevitable from what the Minister has announced today that VAT on adults' shoes and clothes will go from 12½ per cent to 17½ per cent or 18 per cent over the next two budgets, that VAT on electricity will go from 12½ per cent to 17 or 18 per cent, that VAT on fuel oil and on home heating oil will go to 17 or 18 per cent and that VAT on telephone calls will go up to 17 or 18 per cent.  When we go back to the meagre reliefs being given to the income tax payer we can tell mothers organising family budgets that they will get income tax relief that does not even allow for inflation, that they will pay extra <Col N="1104" /> VAT on every pair of shoes they buy for themselves, their husbands or tall children, that their electricity bills will go up by 2½ per cent, with a promise of it increasing by another 5 per cent over the next two years, that their telephone bills will go up by 2½ per cent.  When taxpayers look at the tax relief they were getting on insurance they will see that they are losing relief there as well.  The relief on a husband's life insurance policy is also gone. That is tax reform.  I wonder what the policy on harmonisation now is?  There are fundamental questions to be asked about the Minister's intentions.  We know the Minister intends pulling the standard rate down to 17 per cent but we have no idea what he will do with the rest of the VAT.  Is the zero rate safe?  Will next year's announcement at the back end of the budgetary speech be that there will be VAT on food, medicine, animal feeding stuffs, pharmaceutical supplies and so on?  Will next year's announcement be that all those things the EC will not allow him raise from 10 per cent on this occasion, will be raised?</P>
    <P>The Minister also has a commitment to harmonise excise duty.  We all thought that harmonisation would bring reductions on the very high rates of excise duty which pertain in this country, which are the highest in Europe.  Thank God, this year the Minister had the good sense to leave petrol alone, but how can 10p on a packet of 20 cigarettes be justified?  Do not try to sell us the story that the Minister was advised by the Minister for Health that this should be done as a health measure.  They were making up this budget until the middle of the day yesterday.  When they came to the last £21 million somebody said, &ldquo;We will give the fags a bang and it will bring it in fast and nobody will notice&rdquo;.  The mother of the four children in Dundalk when she is making up the family budget tonight and factoring in the 6p per children per day extra, which the Minister in his generosity is giving her, can factor out the 10p per day on the packet of 20 cigarettes which she will have to pay from midnight. She will probably go to Newry to buy her cigarettes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> What is the Government's policy on the harmonisation of export duties?  The Minister or the Taoiseach might address that question tomorrow.  What is the Government's policy on the harmonisation of deposit interest tax?  There is a figure of about £280 million for DIRT. The Minister is committed to removing all exchange controls by the last day of 1992.  We have this budget and the next budget to take action.  Does he think that when all exchange controls are removed a person in this jurisdiction with money on deposit will leave it here and pay tax at 29 per cent on the interest when that person can open a deposit account in Newry, Nurenberg, Brussels, Luxembourg or anywhere else?  I would suggest Luxembourg where it is zero rated. I am sure the friendly local bank manager will suggest it also and will arrange the transfer.  There will be a flood of money from the country, yet it is not referred to in the Minister's speech.  A huge amount of revenue is at risk and the Minister has no policy on it.  We should not be surprised at this.  What has happened in the past is happening again.</P>
    <P>Each Minister of the Government goes to Brussels without any policy whatsoever. An Irish policy is never put on the table.  They always react to the proposals coming from the Commission and consequently we always get caught out.  There is not an Irish position on any major item that comes before the Council of Ministers, and there is no Irish position on the harmonisation of VAT, excise duty or DIRT.  They are being dragged along in the wake of other people's decisions.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance acknowledged that the reductions in VAT last year were not passed on to the consumers.  I was glad he rapped the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the knuckles over the issue and I welcome his insistence that the reductions will be passed on this year.  On the other hand, I do not think he can insist because the mechanism is not in place which punishes people for price fixing.  Until the Bill is brought in to enshrine in domestic legislation those provisions of the Treaty of <Col N="1106" /> Rome which outlaw cartels, monopolies and price fixing, the Minister's reductions in VAT will not be passed on to the consumer.  It will look well on paper but will not look well in the shops where people will find that the price of the hardware remains the same.  I can give an absolute guarantee that the increase in VAT from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent will be passed on very quickly indeed.</P>
    <P>The section on social welfare is extraordinary.  There is a 4 per cent increase across the board but when we take into account the very small sums paid to people on social welfare, the percentge amounts to very little.  We are talking about pennies.  There is no targeting whatsoever.  I often think that Fianna Fáil like a dependent society.  In every town and village they encourage dependency and those who are most dependent vote Fianna Fáil.  They march them down to the polling booths and they vote them in a despicable fashion.  There is this problem with the whole ethos of the main Government party.  We on this side of the House are the party of the hand up, not the party of the handout.  If more people could be provided with jobs, proper increases in social welfare could be provided for those in most need.</P>
    <P>The Minister's provision for children is laughable.  He extends the provision for the fifth child to the fourth child.  With four children in a family, it is less than 6p per day per child.  It is absolutely derisory and I am not sure why the Minister bothered.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to target the social welfare provisions and to pay more attention to the many poverty traps in the system which are preventing people from returning to work.  PRSI is paid on the first £1 of income, whereas tax is not paid until allowances and exemptions are taken into account.  The Minister should have done something about PRSI for the lower paid.  He could, for example, have taken the first £2,500 out of the PRSI net, as we proposed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the modifications in the family income supplement but it should be based on net rather than gross income. The Minister should make this change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> Changes will have to be made in the means test as well.  There will have to be one national means test and the benefits deriving from that will have to be graduated. If people go back to work they are cut off from everything.  Their rent goes up, they lose their medical card, they have to join the VHI, they have travelling expenses going to work and they have to pay union again.  The poverty traps are ensuring that people, especially heads of households, family men with three or four children, cannot afford to go back to work because they will lose out.</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to health, education and housing simply echo the announcements made last week.  My colleagues on the front bench will take up these points in the course of the budget debate.</P>
    <P>The major flaw in this budget is that there is no strategy for jobs.  It is a constant theme that should be echoed through this debate.  There is a kind of hopelessness in Government about jobs. They spent since last June negotiating a social programme and the first announcement after its signature was that the social welfare provision for the live register had to be increased by 7,000.  There are 228,000 people unemployed and the last official figure for emigration was 46,000. There are strategies which can provide jobs.  We know what the total solution is. If we produce more goods and services and sell them competitively abroad, this will require extra people.  Yet we insist on leaving in place a whole series of road blocks which make it impossible for our economy to thrive.</P>
    <P>I have referred previously to the lack of a transport policy.  A total of 125,000 containers are carried by Northern Ireland carriers every year, representing a loss to this economy of £56 million. They collect as far south as Cork and take them as far as London.  We still have no statutory roads authority.  Even the commitment to a statutory roads authority has been omitted from the new programme. We still charge 6.5 per cent excise on articulated vehicles.  Our port costs for container traffic are over 200 <Col N="1108" /> per cent higher than those at the port of Larne.  Is it any wonder that hauliers take what could be described as the geographically illogical route when transporting goods from this country? Petrol and diesel costs are massively in excess of those which pertain in Northern Ireland.  Even when we leave the shores of this country, the UK roads serving Fishguard and Holyhead are a disaster.  I know that the Cabinet fly from country to country in the executive jet.  Nobody begrudges them that &mdash; it is a perk of office.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to make one suggestion to the Taoiseach about a decision which I understand he is about to make, and I make it seriously.  One of the major problems in transport policy in this country is that responsibility for transport is spread over three different Departments.  The Department of the Environment are responsible for roads.  The Department of the Marine are responsible for ports while the Department of Transport are responsible for the State agencies like Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, B &amp; I, CIE, all to do with transport.  Even the Department of Justice are responsible for the administration of policy on the roads through the justice policy.  Is it any wonder that we do not have a national transport policy when there is actually nobody responsible for it?  In all humility, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would suggest to the Taoiseach that in the course of his reshuffle it might be a good idea to create a Minister for Transport who actually has responsibility for transport.</P>

Do you realise, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that over the last decade the State agencies have spent £5 billion in the promotion of industrial jobs here and that there are 20,000 jobs fewer at the end of the decade than there were at the start of it.  I am sure the House realises that the Department of Industry and Commerce, who were mandated by this House to report on industrial policy, in a report recently made a whole series of recommendations which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, has ignored.  Is there any evaluation of the job creation policy of the Government or have the Cabinet accepted the kind of Dickensian view of life of the Progressive Democrats that nothing can be done, that we must go through the nineties with a live register of 230,000 and massive emigration, that all we can do is try to keep up the standards of those at work, try to look after three quarters of the population and write <Col N="1110" /> off the other quarter?  This Dickensian view is expressed by the chairman of the Progressive Democrats quite frequently, and I am afraid it has infected the Government because, as far as I can see, there is no strategy for job creation in the budget.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell at greater length on other sectors, particularly the agricultural sector, but I will leave that to Deputy Deasy who is so capable.  We are disappointed at this mish mash of a budget.  It is impossible to grasp any policy direction in it.  Not alone is it not going anywhere, it is not even treading water.  It is a budget that will be off the rails by mid-June and, certainly, no party on this side of the House could be satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael would expect to do far better.  Fine Gael want a society where lack of educational opportunities will not prevent social mobility, where deference and forelock touching and tuppence looking down on a penny are replaced by a democracy of educated equals building towards the future.</P>
    <P>We want an enterprise society where the efforts of the people and their enterprise is rewarded, where the tax system encourages work, where people who work are properly rewarded, where people who invest get the full fruits of their investment and where everyone has a stake in the country, not just three quarters of the people having a partial stake.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael want an employed society resulting from this enterprise, a society where a job in Ireland is the normal expectation of a school leaver and where periods on the dole are intervals between work and not a permanent way of life. We believe in the society of the hand-up not the society of the hand-out.  We believe in an energetic society, a society which addresses its problems and works to solve them.  We reject the benighted views of the two parties in Government that one million of our people must be condemned to poverty through massive unemployment, emigration and leading unfulfilled lives.</P>
    <P>We believe in a European society.  We <Col N="1111" /> want Ireland to be a modern European democracy equal to any of our partners in Europe in terms of dynamism and enterprise.  We want our living standards to be European standards and our way of life to surpass the European way of life.  We make a pledge that we will work towards the economic, monetary and political unity of Europe.  Fine Gael in Government will be a fully participating member of the European Community solving our problems in the European family, accepting our responsibilities as members of the European family and bringing Irish proposals to the table and not forever reacting to the proposals of others.  We will reject the kind of Ireland frequently portrayed by Government Ministers, an Ireland of moaners and whingers where even the Taoiseach when he was President of the European Council could always be relied on to pull the begging bowl out from underneath the emperor's robes.</P>
    <P>The budget will achieve nothing.  It is the first budget of the decade but it fails dismally to address the problems of the nineties.  It plays for a draw when we badly need a win.  Its financial foundations are suspect and it will send the Government into terminal decline.  Let us all hope that it does not do the same for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A former distinguished leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Sean Lemass, the father-in-law of the Taoiseach, was famous for his phrase that a rising tide lifts all boats.  There are, however, 100,000 Irish citizens who are so firmly beached by the crisis of long term unemployment in our country that even a spring tide in full flood could do nothing for them.  Many of those citizens will never again work in this century unless present policies are changed to positively discriminate in favour of the people who are long term unemployed. Instead in the budget the Government have again told the long term unemployed that they must wait until extra resources become available.  That is the real fundamental indictment of the <Col N="1112" /> budget that the Labour Party want to put on the record of the House this evening.</P>
      <P>Against this background of the misery of long term unemployment the budget represents a failed opportunity.  I will give our reaction to the specific aspects of the budget, and the order in which they were announced by the Minister.  The additional commitment the Minister has made to backing the crisis of long term unemployment is the enormous sum of £500,000 for managerial coherence and administration.  Social Welfare increases are poor having regard to the base on which they are calculated and also taking into account the Government's alleged commitment to the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The Minister has not done nearly enough, for mothers and children in this context.  Consequently his changes will do little to end the poverty trap about which the Government talk so much.</P>
      <P>The changes in regard to education are welcome so far as they go, but they will do little more than undo some of the damage of the past three years.  We still have a long way to go before ending the disadvantage and inequality that this Government have made a feature of the system.  The changes announced in the pupil-teacher ratio for example, will do little to change average class sizes.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tinkered with the PRSI system, and in my view, ended up with the worst of all worlds.  The system, as at present structured, will do nothing to promote either equity or equality and will certainly not improve prospects for employment.  It is long overdue for fundamental reform but tragically the Minister has shirked making that reform in favour of protecting those on high incomes.  They remain unscathed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in tax exemption limits will do little or nothing to relieve the tax burden on PAYE workers.  The number of low paid workers taken out of the tax net is, according to our calculation, the smallest in several years.  The total cost of changes in this area announced by the Minister this afternoon will be less than £10 million this year &mdash; we had sought <Col N="1113" /> £28 million as the bare minimum for this year.</P>
    <P>The aim of a comprehensive health service is laudable in principle but it cannot be achieved without negotiation and, above all, without resources.  The proposals outlined by the Government will add to the waiting lists, lengthen them, rather than reduce them.  The crisis in residential accommodation for the mentally handicapped with which every Deputy in this House, including the backbenchers of the present Coalition Government, are familiar, cannot be met on the basis of their small share in a seven year programme.</P>
    <P>The absence of any increase in local authority housing programmes, especially in the light of the already acknowledged housing crisis, is an extraordinary scandal coming from a party like Fianna Fáil who have such a historic record in the area of public authority housing.</P>
    <P>The marginal changes in the tax rates and bands were hardly worth the Minister's effort.  In fact, the average PAYE worker will find himself or herself carrying a higher tax burden this year.  Without any change, based on the calculations we have been able to make, the total take from income tax, which is principally PAYE, would have risen this year by approximately £225 million, but it will rise by £200 million.  The Minister has given with one hand and taken back with the other where VAT is concerned.  The Minister has signalled that everything now on the 10 per cent VAT rate will go to the higher rates which will follow from EC harmonisation; he has put a stop in relation to construction and other related services, but it is only a temporary stop, and in due course they too must expect to follow the items in the 10 per cent band which have gone into the 12.5 per cent band, which we presume will soon increase up to 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>Increases in heating, ESB and telephone costs announced today will eat into the small increases awarded to social welfare recipients.  Another VAT rate will add to the red tape and bureaucracy faced by many small businesses.  There has been no real attempt made to reform taxation <Col N="1114" /> at it applies to companies.  The Minister's failure to address the need for reform in this area unnecessarily limits the scope for PAYE relief and does nothing, in our view, to bring Irish corporation tax up to the OECD average of 2.7 per cent of GDP.  Last year corporate profits amounted to £6,000 million.  We are suggesting that it would not be unreasonable to have an average tax take from that profit level of 10 per cent, which would yield £600 million.  The Minister has failed, tragically in our view, to achieve that very modest objective which we set out in our pre-budget submission.</P>
    <P>In summary, this budget, in our view, is boring and unimaginative.  The long term unemployed, the people who suffer most from the reality of poverty and those who would have hoped to benefit from tax reform will have to wait for another long year.  This is a timid budget by a Minister and a Government afraid to tap the consensus they have tried to create.  The Labour Party believe that Ireland is bursting with idealism, hope and optimism.  It is made up of individuals seeking fulfilment and self-development and communities fighting to improve their future.  It is their priorities we believe this budget has failed to address.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sound totally negative and critical of this budget but, regrettably, I find I am forced to do so. However, I have carefully gone through the Minister's speech and listed the things I thought were good, and I want to put them on record now.  There are positive proposals to alleviate the suffering of women to the value of £0.5 million; there are positive proposals to assist voluntary and community organisations in their work at local level to the value of £0.5 million; there are proposed changes in the education system on the margin which will improve the delivery of education services in some area to the value, as I calculate it, of £1 million; there is an excellent proposal to extend pay related social insurance to part-time workers combined with the legislation which has been circulated already and which will affect 70,000 workers.  It would be churlish of the Labour Party not to <Col N="1115" /> recognise this measure, which we welcome; there is a recognition that tourism targets will not be easily met this year &mdash; a major effort has been made to increase the budget for advertising and promotion of Bord Fáilte to attract European and North American tourists, by an extra £1 million.  The cost of the election campaign of the Fianna Fáil presidential candidate last November was more than £1.5 million, to put things in context.</P>
    <P>There is a recognition that as the Common Agricultural Policy is brought closer to market forces and away from guaranteed payments for production, CBF will have to get additional funding to promote Irish food products to the value of £1.5 million &mdash; the same amount of money to sell Irish beef was spent to sell Fianna Fáil's presidential candidate.</P>
    <P>There will be £3 million to £4 million made available for what is termed voluntary housing.  There are also good proposals for the conservation of State buildings and an excellent proposal, in my view, to give all Departments a degree of autonomy in the management of their affairs on a three year rolling programme.  There is also a good and welcome proposal to extend rent relief for people over 55 years.  However, I would have suggested to the Taoiseach that it would have been more effective if the Minister for Finance had agreed that everybody who is a tenant of a private landlord should be entitled, as of law, to the right of a rent book, which they still do not have, and people under the age of 55 seeking a rent allowance from the community welfare officer, in the absence of a rent receipt, find it impossible to get the type of assistance they need.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe that if this country is to develop and grow we need to have real economic growth.  We need to get a consensus in our society that will bring that growth about and we need to learn from the mistakes of the past.  I want to say what the Labour Party believe and what we know we can no longer do, not that we ever indiscriminately advocated it in the first place. <Col N="1116" /> Because of the way in which society has developed and moved on, things have changed and there are now constraints on us which did not exist as they did in the past.  We cannot, for example, revert to simple pump-priming of the economy by the State.  All interventions by the State in the economy need to be made in the context of a plan and focused to achieve specific results.  We do not think this budget is moving in that direction. We further recognise that we cannot revert to devaluation of the currency to deal with trade imbalances nor can we set interest rates at whatever level suits our short term purposes.  The reality is that these areas are really determined for us by the international financial system. These are the constraints but I want to focus on the things we can do.</P>
    <P>Basically, we can establish a consensus and national objectives and the means to achieve them through economic and social planning.  The real question here is whether we go for the maximum achievable objectives or settle for agreement based on the lowest common denominators. We can radically reform our taxation system to promote enterprise and efficiency and to ensure equity.  This requires courage and a political acceptance that there are losers as well as winners in tax reform.  We can target our tax incentives and grants to industry to get the best return for Ireland in terms of jobs and wealth repaid.  We can build political alliances with other peripheral regions of the European Community and fight alongside them to have the Community's resources expanded and policies changed so that Irish people can benefit to the maximum extent from integration and the creation of a new Europe to which the Labour Party are committed. Finally, we can reduce unemployment and eliminate poverty if we are prepared to make difficult, hard, tough, political choices.  Basically, the choice is to place people who are disadvantaged on an equal footing in the Government's priorities with the more fortunate in our society who have made regular employment, a reasonable income, a hope for a better future.  We need to make the <Col N="1117" /> commitment, starting with Government but including trade unions, employers and every sector of our society, that unemployment on the scale which we are experiencing is not acceptable, is not inevitable and will be overcome.</P>
    <P>We accept that in many respects this budget is a political statement; so too is the recent <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which we welcome.  We welcome the concept of a programme and we welcome the concept of a social partnership.  I want to point out that so far as the Labour Party are concerned there is a weakness in the entire process by which this budget and this programme were formulated.  It has been, in effect, negotiated and agreed to the exclusion of almost all the Oireachtas Members, including Government backbenchers as regards having any input to the discussions prior to both agreements.  There is also, unfortunately, little evidence in this budget that either tax reform or unemployment are to be tackled within the programme with the urgency which we require and which we regard as necessary.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach if he wants to get support on a long term basis &mdash; and he will have it from the Labour Party &mdash; for the concept of social partnership enshrined in some form of ongoing dialogue, leading to successive programmes over the ten year period, where the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have put on the table of the various negotiations that have taken place then the Oireachtas will have to be involved in a meaningful way. That meaningful way would involve the Members of the Oireachtas in some form of ongoing economic and social committee. If this Government, or any other Government over the next ten years, fails to recognise the dimension of the Oireachtas in giving legislative effect to many of the proposals, which are aspired to in the PESP, then such programmes will be at risk and that in our view would not be a good thing.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to the question of unemployment and the focus that this party want to bring to this debate on this occasion, at the beginning of this decade. <Col N="1118" /> We do so deliberately before we come to tax reform and the relief for PAYE workers or, indeed, the extra benefits that have been allocated to social welfare recipients because unemployment and long term unemployment is the greatest single evil afflicting our society.  In today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> the details of a survey on behalf of the Economic and Social Research Institute are published. Members of this House may already have heard part of an interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning.  It is there for the House to see and I will not read it into the record.  Unless we can focus the resources of our society to deal with the reality of over 100,000 people who would appear to be permanently long term unemployed, then all of the other provisions of the budget and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will have little or no relevance to them.</P>
    <P>There are at this moment as we speak 47,000 people in our society who have not worked for three years or more. There are an additional 20,000 people who have not worked for the last two to three years, and there are 37,000 people who have not worked in the last year to two years.  Why does this crisis exist? The answer is both simple and complex: simple in that the long term unemployed must compete in the marketplace with those currently at work and those entering the labour market for the first time. That simple reality masks a whole series of complex difficulties and issues.  The majority of unemployed men are in the 25 to 45 year age group and in the case of the long term unemployed over half are the heads of households.  Among women there is a much higher level of unemployment in the under 25 year age group than men.  To some people &mdash; some of whom are in this House &mdash; there is a doubt about whether the unemployed want to work.  In my view that is asking the wrong question even if for some they find it a convenient one.  The real question is whether the unemployed have an opportunity to work.  The upturn in the economy in the past two years has seen a welcome reduction in redundancies which in turn has seen a fall in the number <Col N="1119" /> of people claiming unemployment benefit from a peak of 98,000 down to the figure of 65,000.  International evidence, provided by the OECD, suggests that only one of every eight vacancies in the labour market is filled by a person from the ranks of the long term unemployed.  Because our labour force is growing by 25,000 per year, the employment chances of the long term unemployed are even worse in Ireland than in other countries.</P>
    <P>Against this background I have no objection &mdash; indeed I welcome the recognition of the problem &mdash; to the Government proposals to concentrate on areas of high unemployment.  Pilot surveys and local community initiatives funded by the additional sum of £500,000 do not even begin to get near recognition of the extent of the problem.  It simply is not enough. All the tinkering, welcome as it may be for the immediate recipients, people on the edge of the social welfare system, including the long term unemployed, is no substitute for a real job.  We have the reality, as we speak here tonight, of children who are living in houses where they are facing a third generation of people who will never work in their lifetime. We are talking about people in their thirties who will never work in this century because our society is incapable of providing them with a job.  We can provide them with some kind of an income, marginally adjusted, called long term unemployment benefit but it is no substitute for real work and that is where this budget fails.</P>
    <P>I could go on at some length to indicate what the Labour Party would have wished this budget to do.  In deference to the time constraints which are upon all of us I simply draw the attention of the House to the detailed submission which we made before this budget to the Minister for Finance and which was given out to the media.</P>
    <P>In addition to the problem of the long term unemployed, there are difficulties encountered relating to the proverty trap in terms of getting people on the margin <Col N="1120" /> of employment back into full employment if they can overcome the disincentives our tax and social welfare system are to them and which prevent them from returning to work.  The poverty trap with all the expertise, all the computer models of the Department of Finance, all the brilliance of the various research institutes, still exists.  Tomorrow morning the independent experts will tell us that the poverty trap in real terms still exists.  We still have crippling PRSI rates at the bottom level of the payments scheme. We still have the nonsense of an exemption up to £60 a week for PRSI.  The reality is that if you earn £61 a week you wil have to pay PRSI.  This budget does not deal with the poverty trap.  The poverty trap compounded with long term unemployment is an obscenity that does not have to happen in our society.  We are not a poor people.  Yet this obscenity will continue though 1991 because the Coalition Government have failed to avail of this opportunity to eliminate it in its entirety or severely dent its negative social impact.</P>
    <P>Our expectations of tax reform and progress in this area were so great that they were comprehensively leaked. There was not one bit of surprise or element of imagination in what was read into the record of the House this afternoon by the Minister for Finance.  As I have already indicated, the people who pay the highest amount of direct tax from their incomes, the PAYE workers, will in real terms pay £200 million more this year before they start to come to terms with the other increases the Minister has outlined.  The changes are simply tinkering with the margins of the system and do not address the fundamental problems we identified in our submission to the Minister prior to the budget.</P>
    <P>We have already said that in a system of real tax reform there are winners and losers.  One cannot have it both ways and pretend that tax reform will affect everybody positively and nobody negatively. The Labour Party certainly do not support the view that tax reform, as proposed originally by the Progressive Democrats, can be financed by tax cuts where <Col N="1121" /> the people who pay for the tax reform of people on high incomes are those dependent on public services.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe there are three basic elements which are essential if tax reform is to take place in a meaningful way in our society.  First, the tax base needs to be widened.  This means more tax would be collected from those who are paying less than their fair share and the special exemptions from tax which erode the tax base would be reduced and eliminated.  Secondly, taxes should be collected on time and, thirdly, the benefits of various allowances to income taxpayers should be equalised by converting them all into tax credits.</P>
    <P>If ever there was a time to continue some of the good work done in the area of tax collection and in shortening the time for bringing in taxes, which this Government and previous administrations had instituted, now is the time to do it, 700 days before the reality of 1992.  Yet this budget does little or nothing to effectively improve the tax base in any meaningful sense.  As has already been said by a previous speaker, the budget does not make any allusion whatsoever to the problem of substituting the £180 million revenue from DIRT tax with some other form of revenue after 1992.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the failure of the Government to significantly take any kind of increased take of revenue from the corporate sector in Irish society.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which was built on the contribution of workers in the public and private sectors who had foregone legitimate increases in their wages, enabled a large number of Irish companies and corporations to make healthy profits to the tune of £6,000 million last year.  We could, and should, have moved to the European or OECD average of 2.7 per cent of GDP take which would have brought us up to about £600 million.  We have failed to do that. Yet the corporate sector are capable of paying that kind of tax level.  This is a missed opportunity which the Government will rue as we move towards next year's budget and the one after that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> The Labour Party believe there was a strong and legitimate argument for increasing the take from the taxation of assets.  Notwithstanding the difficulties which have afflicted the farming community over the past year and a half there is a very strong argument for the reintroduction of the straightforward, simple to comprehend and easy to pay land tax which the 1987 minority Fianna Fáil Government abolished and which would have been charged at £10 per adjusted acre.</P>
    <P>The budget references to health and housing need to be addressed very firmly tonight.  My colleagues in the Labour Party will have a lot of detailed and incisive points to make during the debate tomorrow and over the coming weeks. Over the past year or so, and certainly during the conclusion of the negotiations on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> various Government spokespersons spoke extraordinary nonsense about health and the provision of taxpayers money for the health services. Indeed, the Taoiseach who previously admitted on radio that he was not aware of the extent of the health crisis in the real world, should be advised that that crisis has not gone away.</P>
    <P>Having promised increases across the board in the programme the Southern Health Board, whose services have already been pared to the bone, have effectively been told to cut another £6 million off their services this year.  This is happening against a background of improvements.  A health board who are down to the basement level in terms of thrift and parsimony have been told by the Minister for Health to find another £6 million.  According to the members of the health board &mdash; presumably there are Fianna Fáil members on the board who still have contact with the Minister for Health and can tell him this &mdash; these savings of £6 million can only be achieved by increasing waiting lists to a point where lives will be put in danger and untold hardship will result.  We already know that there will be no capital investment in the health board area next year and there will be cuts in current spending, <Col N="1123" /> which will lead to the inevitable loss of further beds and a reduction in staff.</P>
    <P>I have been told reliably today that the Minister for Health has instructed the board of Tallaght hospital that, notwithstanding the fact that all the necessary contract documentation is available and that the construction contractors on the short list were told they might receive an invitation to tender, there will be no invitation to tender issued to construct that hospital in 1991.  If that is not true I would be happy to be corrected but I have been so reliably informed.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Minister for the Environment should be in the House when the topic of housing is being discussed. As I said before the Minister joined us, giving every tenant of a private dwelling the legal right to a rent book would be a greater contribution to security of tenure and equity in the housing market than the welcome additions in terms of tax relief which the Minister for Finance has announced for people aged 55 years and over in private rented accommodation.  The public authority housing crisis here will become progressively worse as emigration tails off and people can no longer flee to Britain to seek employment because of the failure of the Irish economy, particularly in urban areas.  I am not so sure that the Minister is aware of the seriousness of this problem.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas which require mention in the context of this budget debate but I do not think it is appropriate to do so in view of the time available to us except to say that if we are to survive in this decade as a people we have to have a common consensus and common objective.  The Labour Party believe that that common consensus, components of which have been slowly put together at some cost over the past three to four years, must be built upon.  In that context we see a major role for the Irish State both in the negotiation rooms of the Councils of Ministers in Brussels and the way the State intervenes in the Irish economy.  There is no point in the Irish taxpayer funding at great cost <Col N="1124" /> inducements and incentives for industry to be established or to expand in this country or for foreign industry to be attracted to this peripheral part of Europe if at the same time there is an absence of an industrial policy for the whole of Europe.  I am informed that the IDA on a number of occasions in recent times have gone as far as negotiating the entry of foreign companies into the Irish economy based on the package of incentives, tax reliefs and grants that we as a peripheral nation in Europe are able to offer but have been scooped at the end of the day by a central region within the European Community that can offer even a bigger incentive.  That is nonsense and it has to be negotiated away.</P>
    <P>There are 20 tax-free corporation, investment and industrial zones in the centre of Europe and as long as they stay there the IDA in Ireland or their counterparts in Spain, Greece, Scotland or Wales will have an impossible task. The Government appear in the economic area to have no coherent economic policy in the context of 1992.  We must move beyond the context of the begging bowl and of believing that if we produce any food and sell it into intervention that will be sufficient.  We have to move to a position where we can learn to earn our own living in a manner that is fitting to all of us.  One of the ways we can do that is to construct a new political alliance within the Europe of 1992 that will link those countries on the periphery of Europe and demand, in cohesion, that there is produced within the halls of Brussels an industrial policy that will allow the peripheral areas to develop and grow. We are not looking for handouts but for European equality that will enable this country, with its advantages and disadvantages, to compete equally with other better positioned economies in Europe.</P>
    <P>That is the other side of the 1992 project. It is not just about harmonisation of tax rates, which will be very difficult.  This Government have lost an opportunity to achieve some of that harmonisation in this budget.  It is about creating, within the framework of a single market, a valid economic policy which will enable the <Col N="1125" /> blocked energy of the Irish economy to be released.  To do that you need economic leadership and vision.  One of the few set-piece debates during the course of our political calendar is the budget speech by the Minister for Finance.  There is no vision; there is no hope, there is no perspective and there is no sense of what is going to be done in the next 700 days, between now and 1992.  There is no sense of where the Minister for Industry and Commerce wants to go.  There is no sense of where the Minister for Transport wants to move in relation to harmonising or reducing the cost barriers that are there for Irish goods and services.</P>
    <P>This is a tired Government that have run out of ideas and have produced a timid and unimaginative budget.  Those people who are at work, who are fortunate enough to have good jobs, are now living in a country where there is no sound economic leadership from the Government.  For those people who are not at work through no fault of their own there are very marginal social welfare increases.  The increase is not 4 per cent per annum.  That is a nonsense.  It is 2 per cent per annum because the increase will not be given until July.  Therefore it is not ahead of inflation but is just barely in line with it.</P>
    <P>Finally, excluding Spain we have the highest rate of unemployment in the entire Community, and that problem will not easily go away.  The rising tide will never come near these people.  Their boats are so far up the beach that they will not even see the tide.  Market forces, the great god of the Progressive Democrats and perhaps the born again Fine Gaelers and some of the Fianna Fáilers, will not on their own bring that tide near enough to the long term unemployed.  If we cannot get the tide up to them, then all the tinkerings on the social welfare side, the dependency culture, the payouts and the hand-outs, the begging bowl syndrome of our society, which may take away some of their hurt and their pain, will not give them what they are entitled to in the last decade of this century &mdash; the right to go out in the morning to a job and for their children to see them <Col N="1126" /> going out to work.  In that sense this is a failed budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As other speakers have emphasised, this budget is disappointing. As Deputy Quinn has said, it is unimaginative, and it is a failure.  It fails in almost every test.  It does nothing for the unemployed and leaves job creation once again to the market forces which have never delivered jobs in the past.  It does nothing for the poor. Increasing social welfare payments generally in line with inflation is simply accepting the <i>status quo.</i> There is no real tax reform.  The adjustments are derisory and will still leave the PAYE sector crucified by tax while the rich will continue to benefit from loopholes.  It does nothing for the homeless.  The 20,000 people who are officially on our housing lists have little enough to hope for out of this budget and indeed the young people who are living rough on our streets have nothing at all to hope for from the budget. The Minister seems to have entirely ignored the likely impact of the external factors on the Irish economy.  In this budget he has constructed a house of economic cards which could be brought down by the insane war in the Gulf.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds opened his speech by making a ritual nod towards unemployment when he said that growth in employment was a priority for the Government.  He then proceeded to ignore the unemployed for the remainder of his speech.  It is hard to identify one initiative, reform or suggestion which will create even a single additional job.  The unemployed are to be abandoned for another year to their own devices.  The Minister for Finance has shown that he has feet of clay when it comes to making any effort to even reduce unemployment. Indeed the admission from this Government is that unemployment will rise in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister claims that the general increase in social welfare payments at 4 per cent will be above the rate of inflation, many economists expect that inflation will rise rapidly as a result of the Gulf situation, and this could leave those <Col N="1127" /> on social welfare even worse off at the end of the year.  The 4 per cent increase could only be considered adequate if the basic rates of social welfare were sufficient to protect those in need, but this is clearly not the case.  The 4 per cent increase in social welfare will mean about £2 per week for a person on short term unemployment assistance.  He or she would still be getting less than £50 per week, more than £10 below the level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Once again payment of the miserly increases is being deferred until the end of July while, for instance, the VAT increases will come into effect in March. The increase of £1 million in the money allocated for the family income supplement is an insult to those who negotiated the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> who clearly expected a far more substantial allocation to help families in need.</P>
    <P>There has been no tax reform and no widening of the tax base.  Virtually all tax reliefs for special interest groups have been maintained.  Once again the Minister has resorted to the three card trick of juggling around the rates but the benefit of this will be minimised for most taxpayers by his failure to adjust the allowances or the bands in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>The Minister made much of his decision to increase the tax exemption levels.  The increase in tax exemptions will still leave tens of thousands of people in the tax net who are officially categorised by the Combat Poverty Agency as poor.  The exemption should have been increased to at least £100 per week for a single person and £200 a week for a couple.  This would have been real tax reform, but Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have ducked it once again.  In addition, many of the 18,000 taxpayers who the Minister is claiming will be taken out of the tax net will find themselves back in the net within a matter of months if they get the 4 per cent wage increase promised in the PESP.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> Once again the Minister has made some changes to tax avoidance schemes like the business expansion scheme, section 84 and section 23.  I have no doubt that the tax experts are already looking for new loopholes.  Given the damning indictment by the Comptroller and Auditor General, I am surprised the Minister has not moved to end the BES scandal.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the budget comes at a time of great uncertainty and the whole budget speech we have just heard could, quite literally, become meaningless and irrelevant should the Gulf War continue and lead to an interruption in oil supplies or indeed to a substantial increase in oil prices.  Apart from the appalling loss of life and suffering inflicted on the Middle East, nobody should doubt that the gung-ho militarism we are now witnessing in the Gulf can do enormous damage to the economies of countries like Ireland.</P>
    <P>At home the Government's self-proclaimed economic miracle is fading fast; unemployment, emigration and homelessness are still unacceptably high.  The recent increase in interest rates will raise the inflation rate, hit mortgage holders and add to job creation difficulties.  There has been a major outflow of funds and the reserves fell sharply towards the end of last year.  The health services are still inadequately funded and many health boards are forced to consider yet more cuts in services.  Local authorities, likewise, are being starved of sufficient finance to provide even basic services.  The gap in income between the rich and the poor in Irish society has not been narrowed and it is generally recognised that the benefits which flowed from the recently expired <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> were unevenly and unfairly distributed.</P>
    <P>Trade unionists at the moment are preparing to ballot on the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> No doubt, they will have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the proposals, balancing a disappointing level of wage increases against possible benefits from promises of tax reform, <Col N="1129" /> promised improvements in health services and promises in many other areas. They will bear in mind that, so far, they are only promises.  This budget cannot be viewed in isolation from that programme. Indeed, in recent years, the annual budget has taken on less and less importance although it is always hyped up into a big political media event.  However, the budget has not been used as a vehicle for promoting industrial, economic or social development and has been, primarily, an exercise in book balancing and creating an illusion of benefit for people outside this House.  What is given by one hand is, generally, taken away by the other.</P>
    <P>This Government have never believed in comprehensive long term economic and social planning as distinct from programming. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is not a comprehensive, long term economic plan; it is far too vague, too generalised and too conditional for that but it does give some indication of the Government's strategy in the longer term.  There is much in the PESP which is commendable but there is also much in it that is vague and woolly.  I want to put the Government on notice that if the trade union movement accepts the programme The Workers' Party intend to be the political watchdog in this Dáil and will be insisting that the commitments are honoured to the letter.</P>
    <P>This budget reflects the politics of wishful thinking; once again we have been treated to generalisations of the type we heard before about creating the right climate for investment and so on and we know that this has never worked.  After decades of creating the right climate for investment, we still have the highest rate of unemployment in the European Community and the numbers on the dole queues are going up again.  The Minister has taken a colossal gamble in this budget.  He seems to have ignored the Gulf War, rising interest rates, increased inflation and higher unemployment although all these factors could result in his figures and assumptions, many of which are over-optimistic anyway, being way off the mark.  If this is so we will be <Col N="1130" /> picking up the pieces and paying the price for many years to come and indeed we may well face a mini-budget before too long.</P>
    <P>The other huge fiscal problem we continue to face is the massive outflow of funds from this country.  The economy has sprung a leak, the annual repayment on our national debt &mdash; at around £2 billion &mdash; is equivalent to the total tax take from the PAYE sector.  The annual profit repatriation by foreign companies amounts to £3 billion per year, well in excess of the total tax take on all incomes. The country is producing wealth but it is flowing out at a massive uncontrolled rate.  We simply cannot afford to endure this massive financial haemorrhage. There is no mystery about the location of the black hole in our economy; the black hole can be found in the vaults of the foreign banks.  Virtually every worker and unemployed person in this country has been asked to make sacrifices to get the economy in order.  Why have the international banks and the foreign multinationals not been asked to make similar sacrifices?  Why are we still waiting for measures to tax repatriated profits? Where is the £3 billion in Structural Funds which, we were told, would make such a difference to this country in the period between 1989 and 1993?  Where are the major infrastructural projects across the country which we were promised?</P>
    <P>When the Estimates were published the Government claimed an increase in the 1991 public capital programme of £118 million or 7 per cent over 1990. While this is technically true it is only part of the picture; the public capital programme, which is crucial to job creation for 1991, is virtually the same as it was nine years ago in 1982.  When allowance is made for inflation this represents a reduction of around 50 per cent and there is no evidence of any increased private sector investment either.</P>
    <P>The Government have admitted that average unemployment in 1991 will be about 8,000 higher than last year.  Many independent economists believe that the <Col N="1131" /> figure will be even worse.  Market conditions at home and abroad are deteriorating, the safety valve of emigration is being closed.  We continue to spend vast sums of taxpayers' and EC money in subsidising industry and agriculture but we are not getting value for money.  There must be proper reporting and accountability. Subsidies and tax breaks, which are not producing jobs, must be withdrawn and the money saved used in alternative job creation strategies.  We need a proper job creation industrial development plan with medium and long term objectives.  Just as there is a special debate on the budget each year in this House, there should also be a special debate on unemployment and job creation each year.  Unemployment and poverty &mdash; and the social problems which flow from them &mdash; have never been seriously tackled in the annual budget and this budget is no different.</P>
    <P>Our social system is increasingly a two-tier one.  In health, education and social welfare our children are suffering from social apartheid.  The children of the poor must endure overcrowded classes, often in semi-derelict school buildings, while the sons and daughters of the rich benefit from private fee-paying schools.  The children of the poor must take their chances on hospital waiting lists while the sons and daughters of the rich can walk into the Blackrock Clinic and have their medical needs attended to instantly. Those on social welfare must fight an endless demoralising battle to feed and clothe their children while the wealthy elite agonise over the destination of their foreign holidays.</P>
    <P>It is entirely to our shame as a State and as a people that, 70 years after independence, one-third of our population still live in poverty and that almost 50 per cent of our children are in need.  This budget does not tackle the underlying problem.  Indexation of social welfare in line with inflation is not enough, it is simply a form of standing still.  We are still way off target in regard to figures set by the Commission on Social Welfare and the Government's promise in the new <Col N="1132" /> programme to meet the commission's recommendations by 1993 is, quite simply, a confidence trick.  It is now clear that what the Government have agreed to implement by 1993 is what the commission described in 1985 as the minimum priority rate.  In 1985 that was £45 per week and even if this is updated in line with inflation it will leave people little better off than they are now.  The Government should implement the general recommendation of the commission which was a minimum payment of between £50 and £60 per week.  Updated for inflation that would now give an average of around £62 per week.  That should be the minimum payment for an adult on social welfare.  It is a modest enough sum and represents approximately one-quarter of the average male industrial wage. People cannot live on the rates of social welfare they are now getting.  I challenge the Minister to try to live on the existing basic rate of unemployment assistance not just for a week but for a period of a few weeks or months to see how well he would be able to survive when the bills start to build up or to see if he could survive on the £62 per week the commission proposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues seem to be ignorant of and indifferent to the plight of those on social welfare, especially the long term unemployed.  Has the Minister any idea of the demoralising, soul-destroying, spirit-sapping impact of unemployment?  Only today the ESRI published a report which shows that unemployed people are five times more likely to suffer from high levels of psychological distress than those at work. Unemployment has an impact on mental health in two major ways according to the authors of the report.  It can be damaging because the self-esteem of the individuals affected is lowered as a result of their being denied the opportunity to participate in society in a manner which preserves their dignity.  Unemployment also has an effect arising from a deterioration in day to day economic circumstances and, ultimately, through the grinding consequences of poverty.  They write further that the most effective way of <Col N="1133" /> increasing an individual's self-esteem and feelings of personal control and improved mental health is to create jobs and to remove people from poverty.</P>
    <P>None of this will come as any surprise to those who have any knowledge of unemployment and its consequences but apparently to judge from this budget it is a matter of total indifference to the Government.</P>
    <P>There is also an urgent need to look at the levels paid for child dependants.  It is time the Government recognised that it costs more to feed and clothe a teenager than a young infant and introduced higher payments for older children. Given our levels of child poverty we need to substantially increase the level of child benefit which is among the lowest in Europe.  We believe that it should be doubled in view of the significant numbers of children in our society who are living in poverty.</P>
    <P>Since the campaign for tax reform began in the seventies the tax system has actually become less progressive.  The revenues from capital, inherited wealth, property and the farming and corporate sectors have actually fallen as a percentage of the total.  Various subsidies and reliefs have been increased or introduced even though their value in terms of agreed social and economic priorities is repeatedly questioned.  We are not arguing for a reduction in overall tax take and do not regard those who do as socially irresponsible.  The priority must be to share the tax burden more fairly on the basis of ability to pay.  This means bringing into the tax net all those who have incomes, wealth and property on which no real contribution is levied.  It also means reducing the scope for minimising the contribution, more effective capital gains thresholds and the introduction of a minimum rate of corporation tax to ensure that every profitable company make some social contribution which should be not less than 10 per cent of profits.  At present six out of seven companies pay no tax at all and for those who do the effective rate is only 7 per cent to 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Tax reform also means that the various <Col N="1134" /> loopholes provided by the section 23 and business expansion schemes must be closed tightly.  It must also mean an increased tax take from wealthy farmers and an increase in the rate of PRSI charged to farmers and other self-employed people for their pensions from the 5 per cent to the 6.6 per cent recommended by the National Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>Particular attention needs to be paid to the plight of the tens of thousands on or below the poverty line who are paying tax.  It is ludicrous that between 11 per cent and 18 per cent of those living in poverty should be paying income tax which in more than half the cases amounts to £20 a week or more.  A real effort must be made to remove a substantial number of low paid from the tax net entirely and as an initial step The Workers' Party have argued that the level at which tax should begin to be deducted should be increased to £100 per week before allowances for a single person and £200 for a couple.  Of course this budget goes nowhere near those thresholds.</P>
    <P>Tinkering with the income tax rates and bands does not amount to tax reform. Indeed I disagree fundamentally with the statement made by the Minister that reform means in essence widening the tax base in order to reduce personal income tax rates.  The big scandal in the tax system is the number of wealthy people and sectors who pay virtually no tax whatsoever. The Government must honour their commitment to removing many more low paid workers from the tax net and shifting some of the tax burden off lower and middle income tax PAYE workers.  However they must not try to pass this off as tax reform.  Tax reform is always welcome for the overtaxed and they certainly deserve it but a restructuring of the system is equally as important and in the long term is probably more so.</P>
    <P>No attempt is made at fundamental tax reform in the budget.  Fundamental tax reform is promised in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and is what is called for by the National Economic and Social Council, the Commission on Taxation and by virtually all the political <Col N="1135" /> parties.  Is it the mandarins in the Department of Finance or the men in their Porsches in the Financial Services Centre who have a veto over fundamental tax reform or is it simply that the Minister has not got the political will to tackle it?</P>
    <P>The entire tax system is balanced in favour of the well off.  Workers on the average industrial wage can lose 60p in every extra pound earned in overtime, yet an article in last week's edition of <i>Sunday Business</i> Post quoted a recent paper by Donal de Buitléir, head of group taxation at AIB, in which he explained how someone on a salary of £60,000 per year could protect £27,000 of his or her income from any tax liability by the clever use of tax exemptions.  When we compare these with a man or woman who earns less than £70 per week and is still caught in the next net under PAYE it is nothing short of a scandal.</P>
    <P>The wealthy have an endless array of devices to enable them avoid their fair share: deeds of covenant, capital allowances on property investments, BES gimmicks, tax free dividends from tax free companies, tax free capital gains and confidential accounts.  There is not one single redundant worker or local authority tenant in the State who can have a confidential account but the wealthy can have all the confidential accounts they like.  The list goes on and each year the Minister moves to close off a few loopholes but no sooner is the ink dry on the Finance Bill when the tax accountants and lawyers are pouring over it to find new loopholes.  Indeed, the stakes are so high that they can pay for months of work and effort to find these loopholes.  The only way to deal with this is to phase out the allowances providing the loopholes, especially those which deliver nothing in terms of job creation or other social benefits. Despite some small improvement in recent years the rate of company taxation is way below the level in most other countries.  There is considerable scope for additional taxation revenue from business and industry without in any way damaging their competitiveness.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about having a fair <Col N="1136" /> tax system we also need to look at the administration of the system.  The numbers employed in the Revenue Commissioners have declined steadily while the workload has grown enormously. When self-assessment was introduced for the self-employed we were promised that there would be strict policing of the system but according to the Secretary of the Irish Tax Officials Union the self-employed can effectively write their own tax bills.  The Minister admitted to the House on 11 December last that while there were 210,000 self-employed taxpayers on the books of the Revenue Commissioners only 563 returns or about a quarter of one per cent were actually audited.  Many taxpayers had hoped that this budget would see the beginning of tax reform but what we have got instead is another round of fiddling at the margins.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to draw attention to another scandal in the budget and that is the scandal of the failure to deal with the plight of the people in our society who suffer from mental handicap and the parents who are trying to cope with that problem.  It has been pointed out on numerous occasions by the parents of the people who suffer from mental handicap that the shelter, the physiotherapy and speech therapy facilities and physical education available to them is under resourced and in many cases non-existent.</P>
    <P>There are parents in our society who are afraid to get sick because they have sons or daughters now in their thirties or forties who have nowhere to go.  There are elderly parents who fear to die because they have nowhere for their mentally handicapped sons or daughters to go, and there is nothing in this budget, despite all the pleadings of the parents and the submissions they have made, to help them cope with that problem.</P>
    <P>The parents have estimated there are at least 1,000 young men and women with mental handicap who need shelter and they do not have it.  They have pointed out that in the last year alone the numbers in the Eastern Health Board area needing such shelter have increased by 100.  They have pointed out that in most cases the <Col N="1137" /> health boards do not even have the statistic to plan for the future development of the services for people with mental handicap, and there is nothing in this budget to deal with that problem.  As far as I am concerned it is one of the greatest scandals that the Minister can stand up in this House knowing the facts, knowing all the lobbying that has gone over the past year, and yet he has done nothing to deal with that real human problem in our society.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> This Financial Resolution provides for a budget day increase in excise duty of 8.1p, that is 10p, including VAT at 23 per cent, on a packet of 20 cigarettes with <i>pro rata</i> increases on other tobacco products.  It also provides a further increase of 2.8p in excise duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes with <i>pro rata</i> increases on other tobacco products from 1 March 1991 so as to leave the retail price unaffected by the change in the standard rate of VAT.  I do not know whether I need explain that any further.  The changes in VAT will not come into effect until 1 March next.  Therefore, the additional change has to be made at that date so that the 10p increase will be effective.</P>

      <P>We are not voting against this even though there is a strong temptation to do so because the level of increase is savage.  I do not believe the reason given by the Minister this afternoon. This was not done for health reasons but purely monetary reasons.  People may throw their hands up in horror and say that the money should not be spent on tobacco and cigarettes but the Minister should remember that we have many unemployed people and perhaps their only consolation during the day is to smoke.  Without having figures to prove it, I would reckon that they are a very large percentage of our smoking population. This imposition on unemployed people is far too much.  We all accept the irrefutable evidence that smoking damages health and that it is related to cancer, but there are thousands of people, largely unemployed people, who have few comforts in life apart from smoking.  To put 10 per cent of the cost of a packet of cigarettes is unthinking and unfair to those people.</P>

      <P>There are many excesses in life at the moment and if they were to be cured by increases at budget time it would be a solution to many of our problems.  The Minister in introducing his budget today said he was not increasing the old reliables.  Cigarettes were always an old reliable and in days gone by it was regarded as a very harsh penalty to increase excise duty on tobacco.  Now attitudes are changing in relation to smoking.  It seem that now an increase of 10p on a packet of cigarettes can be sold as a penalty for being environmentally unsafe.  That is the wrong way to go about it if that is the intention.  Of course that is not the intention.  If this is a way to penalise smokers it has failed over and over again.  In 1981 the increase brought the cost of a packet of cigarettes to over £1 and now ten years later it is over £2 and it will not stop people smoking.</P>
      <P>If we want to stop people smoking, if we believe that it is a danger to health, then we should pursue the programme the Minister for Health embarked on and if it fails he must take other measures to inform the public of the dangers.  Perhaps advertising which implies it is a macho thing to smoke should be looked at.</P>
      <P>This is a way of helping to balance the budget.  People who smoke would prefer if they did not.  They are hooked on it and want to change but only some people have the willpower to change.  Certainly increasing the price of cigarettes will not change that habit.  As Deputy Barry said, this is about the only consolation some people have and they are prepared to spend a proportion of the meagre money they get from social welfare or in unemployment benefit to buy a packet of Woodbine or pipe tobacco in order to have that little bit of enjoyment.  Old people who have been smoking all their lives will not change.</P>

      <P>My point is that we are opposing this increase because it is simply to raise funds for the Exchequer.  This has not been done as a health promotion activity.  It will hit people who perhaps have not the willpower to stop smoking, who have no other pleasure in life.  This old reliable should be excluded from additional tax.  Drinking is every bit as bad for health.  In the case of those who drink and drive, perhaps the Minister for Finance should have increased the price of drink to stop that happening.  The Minister has let that off.  In fact, the price has been reduced because of the reduction in the higher level of VAT.  The argument fails and I intend to oppose this.</P>

      <P>I find it a bit difficult to get worked up about this resolution, although it provides an opportunity for the House to show what it thinks about this budget.  Smoking is injurious to health and, therefore, it is a bit difficult to argue against a choice like this being made.  If the Minister for Finance has to raise some revenue from the old reliables and has a choice between the pint of Guinness and the packet of cigarettes, I can see a lot of sense in the decision that was made.  I would be a great deal more impressed if there was a link between the revenue raised and the revenue being earmarked for health awareness purposes. There is no evidence that it is going anywhere other than into the maw of the Exchequer generally.  In that sense what Deputies Barry and Kavanagh have said is probably true.  If we believe the notice compulsorily displayed on cigarettes to the extent that smoking is bad for health, <Col N="1143" /> it is very difficult to argue that the choice made here is logically wrong but it offers us an opportunity, being the first resolution, to comment on this unimaginative and unadventurous budget.</P>

      <P>There is an obligation for all Deputies to be orderly.  I want to make a couple of points about this resolution.  I do not accept it was on health grounds that this 10p increase is being imposed as the Minister's speech suggested earlier.  If that were the case, why did the Minister not impose 20p or something more severe?  I reject the suggestion that this is imposed on health grounds.  This is a revenue-raising imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the need for EC harmonisation of taxes and duties, it would seem that there will be a great disparity between the cost of cigarettes here and in the <Col N="1144" /> North of Ireland which borders the constituency of the Minister for Health.  We may find that people will stock up by buying across the Border and we may have to remove these costs in the future.</P>
    <P>If the Ministers for Health and Finance are serious about the health risk, why not go for a total ban on cigarettes over a given period, say between now and the year 2000 or 2005?  We should set some specific period for the banning of cigarettes if that is the objective.  It is objectionable that we should seek to raise revenues on the poor health which will be suffered by those who smoke cigarettes. That was the reason given by the Minister. Fine Gael will not oppose this resolution but it is disingenuous to suggest that its introduction is for health reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We should dispel the myth that the only people who enjoy smoking cigarettes and even over-indulging in them are those depending on social welfare or living in desperation because of unemployment and social deprivation. That is an unfair and incorrect suggestion. People of all classes are smokers.  It is not just poor people who engage in this unsocial habit.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance implied that he imposed this increase because the Minister for Health told him he was worried about the number of people smoking. If that is a fact, we should deal with it head on.  It is sad that more and more young girls are being attracted to smoking. This is much less the case in regard to young men.  It is a dangerous and disturbing trend in society but it is not sufficient that the Minister for Health should supposedly whisper in the ear of the Minister for Finance and say that the way to solve this problem is by increasing taxes. An increase in tax would not, on its own, be sufficient to deter people from smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health warning on cigarette packets has done nothing to deter first-time smokers, teenagers and school children. The Minister may in due course outline exactly what he intends to do to reinforce public awareness regarding the dangers of smoking and to reverse the trend of <Col N="1145" /> tobacco smoking among young people. Perhaps he will outline the development of the existing policy of his Department for a public educational campaign to persuade people voluntarily to desist from smoking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance said he was imposing an increase of 10p on cigarettes because he wanted to deter people from smoking.  He said the Minister for Health had had a word with him. I do not accept that.  It was merely an excuse for hitting one of the old reliables in order to raise revenue.  Having made his statement, however, the Minister should live up to it.  I accept Deputy Byrne's point that young boys are not smoking to the extent they did when I was growing up.  They are more involved nowadays in fitness and sport.  The number of young girls who are smoking is noticeable but that is their affair.</P>
      <P>I would point out that old people enjoy smoking.  Old men enjoy a pipe because it whiles away a long dreary day.  Many old people are living in misery, as the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach are aware.  In my constituency we have a terrible problem that there is nowhere for old people to go even for a few weeks during the winter months and some people live in terrible conditions.  I would suggest that the Minister for Health should whisper to the Minister for Finance that he wants to use the extra 10p for these old people who served this country well and built it up.  They made no contribution to the massive debt we have today.  They worked hard and brought this country through bad times.  Those who think we are seeing bad times now should talk to people over 70, 80 and 90 years of age.  I suggest that the Minister should target that money to give those old people some little relief in the last years of their lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak on behalf of pipe smokers.  It is not only old people who smoke pipes; the Minister should encourage young people to take up the pipe.  The Minister for Finance says he is doing this on behalf of the <Col N="1146" /> Minister for Health.  I do not believe this for a moment.  The Minister for Health has never condemned pipe smoking. There is no health warning on pipe tobacco.  If the Minister says it is a danger to health, will he tell us what the proof is?  When the price of cigarettes is increased in a budget the price of pipe tobacco is always increased as well.  If cigarettes are such a danger to health, as I think they are, the alternative should be to encourage people to smoke healthy tobacco, that is pipe tobacco.</P>
      <P>I refer the Minister to the increase in the price of chewing tobacco.  What danger is there in chewing tobacco? Anyone who chews tobacco spits it out, so there may be a danger to other people. I never met anyone who chewed tobacco and I am amazed they are still making it. Does any Member know a person who chews tobacco?  Are they still making chewing tobacco?  It is stated here every year as part of the budget that the Minister is increasing the price of chewing tobacco.</P>
      <P>If one wants to discourage people from smoking cigarettes one should give the incentive of cheaper pipe tobacco and encourage the smoking of pipes instead of cigarettes.  People may not like the pipe and it might put them off smoking altogether.  The Minister should consider this point.  He has continually condemned the smoking of cigarettes but has never condemned the smoking of pipes.  How can the Minister for Finance say he is imposing this increase on behalf of the Minister for Health?  I would ask the Minister for Finance to reconsider and simply to increase the price of cigarette tobacco, leaving the others as they are.</P>

I am glad I was successful in doing so and I feel a lot better healthwise. Many people will not breathe too well tonight when this 10p is put back on their packet of cigarettes.  It is not in character for the Taoiseach to impose this kind of miserly charge against the few remaining people who use cigarettes. I am very surprised that he would make this attack in this way and say that it is for health reasons only.  It is, I believe, a short circuit to get the budget balanced and I do not think there was any thought at all put into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because I am sure Deputies want to get on to the other resolutions.  We should not get into any divisive argument as to whether the Minister for Finance is doing this for health reasons or otherwise. Quite clearly he is doing it for both reasons.  He is doing it, I would say, primarily as a Revenue raising exercise, but it is also true that the price of cigarettes in particular has a bearing on consumption. The figures show that.  Whatever about increasing the price of cigarettes not preventing people from smoking, certainly the observe is true, that lowering the price of cigarettes does encourage smoking. The figures show that.  The real price of cigarettes has fallen by about 5 per cent in the last two years and consumption has increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into the merits or demerits of this too much here, but I would like to say passionately that all tobacco is bad for health.  I am very sad to hear Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla say what he said about pipe smoking and chewing tobacco because one person very near and dear to me died much younger than he should have because he was an inveterate pipe smoker and for no other reason.  Deputy Mac Giolla and others <Col N="1148" /> are deluding themselves if they think pipe smoking is harmless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach can add the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon to that.  He never said a word about pipe smoking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a little less harmful but I do not think there is much to choose between them.</P>
      <P>I would, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, re-inforce very strongly the undeniable statement that all tobacco is bad for health and cigarette smoking is particularly pernicious.  One of the warnings is that cigarette smoking causes cancer and leads to people dying younger than would otherwise be the case.  These are the facts of life.  So if there was no other reason for putting on this 10p it would be justified on health reasons.  That, however, is not the Government's case.  We would openly and honestly admit that we are killing two birds with the one stone.  We want the revenue and at the same time we think it is a good thing to do from the point of view of health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise on this Resolution not because I want to praise the Government on a reduction in excise duty.  What I am concerned about is the means adopted by the Government to increase or decrease this excise as it affects hydrocarbons. There was particular emphasis on this point when the price of oil rose dramatically on the world market and there does not seem to be any device which the Minister for Finance can utilise, even in the current case of war, if the price of oil were to double or to treble in the coming months.  I would like to have heard from the Minister for Finance today when he was speaking about hydrocarbons that he would take some action if the price per barrel of oil doubled or trebled in the event that that man in Iraq were more successful than the coalition say he will be.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that this might arise.  Surely the Minister for Finance should have said it would take some kind of contingency action or make some order.  As far as I can see this order is attached to Finance Acts.  I would like the Taoiseach to reassure us that some interim steps can be taken if the price of oil should escalate. Whatever about being in the city and using public transport, if one is in the country, if one is in the west with the Minister for the Environment and myself, out near the Atlantic shore, one knows all about the effect the price of oil can have.  It takes us longer to come to town and if oil is scarce the effect will be altogether dramatic and Deputies of all parties will get it in the ear.  I would like to know what measures can be taken if <Col N="1150" /> there is such an escalation in the price of petrol and whether the consumer will be protected.</P>

All we can do is hope for two things, first that the duration of hostilities will be as short as possible and, second, that there will not be any major distortion in the world price of oil because the position is at present that the world is awash with oil.  The fluctuations in the price are very largely psychological.  The markets are reacting to developments and not really to the facts and realities of the situation.  I could not give any guarantee.  If the price of oil escalates I am afraid there is no way we could cushion the consumer against it.</P>

This Financial Resolution provides for an increase of about 10 per cent in the annual road tax for the bulk of private cars and there are higher increases for larger cars; the restructuring of the road tax duty bands applicable to goods vehicles and for increases in the rates of duty; the restructuring of road tax applicable to taxis, tractors and the like and for increases in the duty; increases in some of the initial registration charges applicable to vehicles; and finally an increase in the threshold below which the option to pay road tax on a part year basis does not apply from £40 to £70.  The changes will take place from 1 April 1991.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In pages 4 and 5, subsection (1), to delete paragraph (i). </P>
      <P>We are opposed to this section almost in its entirety.  However, Fine Gael are not opposed to the provisions for vintage cars.  If anybody owns a car which is over 30 years old, good luck to them.  It is very clear that the private and the business motorists are already being crucified by the cost of motor vehicles, public service vehicles and freight charges.  These are very severe at present and we believe the present increases are not justified.</P>
      <P>In the case of small public service vehicles, the tax which up until now was £24 is being increased to £50 and this is a very dramatic increase.  Freight carriage costs are being increased substantially. Not only is the tax for the small public service vehicle and for private and business cars being increased but the tax on hearses is being increased dramatically from £26 to £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> We object to this subsection primarily because it does nothing for job creation. It is no excuse to say that because the last increase in the tax on goods vehicles was in 1983 and that it is now timely to increase it.  The fact is that 125,000 containers per year are collected by Northern Ireland carriers from as far south as Cork, they are then carried across the Border and travel to Britain via Larne, Belfast or Warrenpoint and are delivered as far south as London.  That is more economical than for a carrier from the Republic to export these goods via the central or southern corridor.  This is already costing the State £56 million per year in lost revenue.  This has been clearly documented. Yet, here we are increasing the costs to freight carriers and business in general when we should be seeking to reduce costs.</P>
    <P>At present transport costs to Irish industry at nine per cent is twice the European average and it has been estimated by the Confederation of Irish Industry that these costs equal a penalty of something in the order of £500 million to Irish industry.  Our big problem in terms of jobs is access to the marketplace in the context of 1992.  We have to transport our goods to the marketplace and it is important that we reduce the costs to industry but here we find a further increase in taxes on private cars, hearses, public service vehicles, freight carriage and business generally.  This is a wholly unacceptable proposal.  It should have been possible to find this revenue in some other way.  The Budget Statement was remiss in barely mentioning employment but if we are serious about doing something about employment we must reduce the cost to industry, in particular the cost of transport because transport costs are already unacceptable.</P>
    <P>We will be opposing this resolution with the exception of the references to vintage cars.  I will ask the Government to accept our proposals to delete the paragraphs as they are draconian, anti-employment, anti-industry and they are an unacceptable further tax on an already hard-pressed private motorist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party are opposing Financial Resolution No. 3.  Let me begin on a rather minor point.  I came into this debate when the Taoiseach, admittedly as an ancillary argument, was making the point that the case for increasing the price of cigarettes and smoking in general was on health grounds, and it seems rather extraordinary that this was not extended, for example, to the relationship between drink and driving because the same kind of argument could be made that if you make drink more expensive you perhaps would assist the argument for careful driving.  However, I agree that that is not germane to the point we are discussing here.</P>
      <P>In my constituency of Galway West &mdash; people have been speaking about being from the western seaboard &mdash; let me dispose of a particular point as the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn is in the House and he will recall meeting a group of people from several different parishes in Connemara, in particular, making a case on the state of the roads. You, Sir, are familiar with the state of the roads.  People will read with some amusement the concession for vintage cars because they will argue that their rather newer cars can assume an aspect that is far more ancient, aged and dilapidated because of the appalling roads on which they have to travel.  It is insulting to such people who have been told again and again that there are no special funds from Europe which can be used to develop roads in their area or regional funds which can be drawn on.  They have also been told by Galway County Council that they are at the mercy of a Department of the environment allocation; they had gone to the trouble of meeting directly with the Minister for the Environment during Ireland's Presidency of the EC to ask him to come and inspect the state of the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> It is one of the unfortunate ironies perceived by those who live in the constituency of Galway West or who visit us that it is at once presented as a very scenic and attractive area and at the same time people driving to any of these areas see holes in the road in every single parish into which you could put a sack of potatoes.  These people are now being asked to contribute to a general rise in the cost of taxing their vehicles.  As regards the point that because there has not been an increase since 1986 in the case of private cars, let me say there has been a continual deterioration in the roads on which people have to travel. People know quite clearly that revenues that are raised will not go towards improvements of the roads on which they have to travel.  They know that the money they will pay in addition will not relieve their plight and will not find its way to the local authority.  They also know that the same arguments will be made by the local authority when they go on delegations as happened before.  It is therefore fíor-mhasla do mhuintir Chonamara agus muintir na Gaeltachta agus rinne siadsan iarracht an rud a aimsiú don Aire agus do Airí eile ón Eoraip agus thug an tAire gealltanas go mbuailfeadh sé leo agus go mbeadh sé ag tabhairt cuairte ar na bóithre atá go fíor-dhona, mar shampla, sa Ghaeltacht.  Níor deineadh san.  I see this exercise as entirely cynical.</P>
    <P>There is an additional argument in relation to the increased cost of using a private car.  Anybody with a whit of sense in relation to regional planning knows that one of the greatest difficulties in developing regional initiatives, be it in terms of industry, manufacturing, services or whatever, is the state of the infrastructure.  Where is there any commitment, if we were to pay more, that that point would be acknowledged?  Does anybody care that one can gaily gather more money from motorists who are suffering in an individual sense but are also suffering in terms of a regional disincentive?</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach, in his capacity as Minister for the Gaeltacht, chooses to consult Údarás na Gaeltachta or the elected <Col N="1162" /> members they will quickly tell him about the real disincentive the roads are to their efforts at promoting their region.  The position in any town or, in the case of Galway, regional capital, the people using their cars are mostly commuters.  It is not a luxurious usage.  Many people are sharing the costs of travel to and from work by making arrangements and so forth.  For these people it is a net addition to their costs, a net reduction to their real income.  The idea that private motorists can be regarded as an easy mark while at the same time the motorists, for all the other reasons, witnesses a net reduction in the facilities available to them is, to my mind, outrageous.  In addition indirect hidden costs will creep in.  This cost will be passed on for example in the form of increased tax charges.  Elderly people coming from remote areas to visit the regional hospital and so forth will pay higher prices to taxis who will be glad to pass on this charge.  This is an outrageous suggestion.  For all those reasons, both localised and general, the Labour Party will be opposing this Resolution.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat some of the points Deputy Higgins made but I agree with him.  The Workers' Party will be opposing this Resolution because we think it is both economically and environmentally unsound.  Deputy Higgins referred to the situation in Galway West.  In my constituency which includes Tallaght, for example, we do not have a public transport option, and what is the PAYE worker who is bearing the brunt <Col N="1163" /> of taxation supposed to do?  Now we want to penalise him for travelling to work in his car.  There is no apparent discrimination in the measures &mdash; if such discrimination exists it is minimal &mdash; between public and private.  For example, there is a specific section dealing with school buses and youth and community buses.  The private motorist is hit in the fashion I have described. There is no discrimination of any significance as between the size of cars.  The Minister is well aware of the pollution implications of the larger car as compared to the smaller car and, indeed, the implications for consumption of energy &mdash; an issue which was raised by Deputy Carey. I cannot see any merit in this proposal. It is fantastic that electronically propelled vehicles are included.  I will give way, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because the Taoiseach wants to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal briefly with the points raised and I will take the last one first.  In fact, the increases have been structured to ensure that the larger the car the more one pays.  In fact, one-quarter of all motorists with cars of 1,000 c.c. would pay £7 per year and I do not think that is totally outrageous.  I take Deputy Mitchell's point about large heavy duty vehicles.  The figures are quite extraordinary in regard to the heavy duty vehicles. We occupy a very favourable place in the EC table.  After the budget the annual road tax on a typical heavy goods vehicle of 38 tonnes laden weight in Ireland will be £1,030 while in Britain it will be £3,985: £1,030 in Ireland versus £3,985 in Britain.</P>

      <P>Let us have a look at <Col N="1164" /> the price of motoring and what has been said about it.  The first thing I want to say is that the increase of a typical figure of, say, £15 is about 10 per cent in the taxes. As against that, because of the reduction in VAT the motorist will save about £14 per annum on petrol: That is for a motorist doing 10,000 miles per annum at 35 miles per gallon, a typical average motorist.</P>

If Deputies look at the overall expenditure on roads they will see that there is an all time record figure of expenditure of £233 million.

      <P>I move Financial Resolution No. 4:</P>
      <P>(1) THAT&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the rate of value-added tax on goods and services at present chargeable at the rate of 23 per cent (that is to say, taxable goods and services other than those chargeable at any of the rates zero, 10 or 2.3 per cent) be reduced to 21 per cent of the taxable amount or value of such goods and services, and</P>
      <P>(b) the rate of value-added tax on certain goods and services at present chargeable at the rate of 10 per cent be increased to 12.5 per cent of the taxable amount or value, as the case may be, in respect of which tax is chargeable in relation to those goods and services, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>that, accordingly, the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 (No. 22 of 1972), be <Col N="1170" /> amended in subsection (1) of section 11 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1985 (No. 10 of 1985))&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) by the substitution, in paragraph (a), of &ldquo;21 per cent&rdquo; for &ldquo;23 per cent&rdquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 1990 (No. 10 of 1990)), and</P>
    <P>(ii) by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (c):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) (i) 10 per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to the supply of goods or services of a kind specified in paragraphs (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (x), (xi), (xig) and (xii) of the Sixth Schedule,</P>
    <P>(ii) 12.5 per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to the supply of goods or services of a kind specified in the Sixth Schedule other than those to which subparagraph (i) of this paragraph relates, and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(2) THAT this Resolution shall have <Col N="1171" /> effect as on and from the 1st day of March 1991.</P>
    <P>(3)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927). </P>
    <P>This resolution provides for a reduction in the standard rate of VAT from 23 to 21 per cent and an increase in the rate on the supply of certain goods and services from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  The changes will take effect from 1 March 1991.</P>

      <P>I observe that we have some amendments: amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputies Garland, De Rossa, Rabbitte and Barry and amendment No. 2 in the names of the same Deputies.  I am suggesting we discuss amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together. Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), to delete paragraph (b). </P>
      <P>We are opposing this resolution on the basis that we are obliged between now and 1992 to harmonise our taxes, and what the Government are doing in today's budget is not harmonising taxes but shifting the burden from one form of taxation to another.  There will obviously be serious implications for traders along the Border and for the retail trade throughout the country as a result of increasing the level of VAT from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  If the Government were serious about moving towards the harmonising of taxes by 1992 &mdash; only one more budget away &mdash; they would not have increased the rate of VAT from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the selectivity with which they approached the matter.  The increase in VAT will have an effect on inflation.  I admit that, in present circumstances, the inflationary effect will probably not be severe but <Col N="1172" /> the pressure and trend are in the wrong direction.  It is interesting to look at the list of goods subject to the 10 per cent rate as opposed to those on the 23 per cent rate.  A considerable proportion of the goods at the 10 per cent rate are not imported and, therefore, the benefit of the reduction in tax will favour imported goods.  This does not seem to be a good way of creating employment.  Indeed, the whole thrust of the budget is not towards creating employment but to impede its creation.  It affects those who are working or who are willing to work in the future. If we do not adopt growth policies to put more people back to work we will not be able to compete in Europe in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Government do not have a positive attitude towards the creation of employment.  The clear message coming from the budget is that whatever influence the Progressive Democrats had on the Government over the last two years has gone.  I was on a television programme earlier today with the chairman of the Progressive Democrats and it was quite clear that he was grievously disappointed with the budget because it did not make any movement towards tax reform or job creation.  This resolution, increasing VAT from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent on a very wide range of goods, will be a disincentive to people to invest in this country and to create more jobs. Therefore, we oppose this Financial Resolution.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has an amendment tabled in his name and he is now offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>One can understand the proposed reduction from 23 per cent to 21 per cent in terms of our obligations to meet coming harmonisation but I am not <Col N="1173" /> clear on the Government's strategy in terms of the special case they are supposed to be making to the Commission regarding the imposition that will be for our Exchequer.  Everybody in the House will probably understand the reduction to 21 per cent, but it is the proposed increase in the rate of 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent which particularly concerns The Workers' Party.  It is on that matter which we have put down two separate amendments.</P>
      <P>The regrettable aspect of this, apart from the considerations which Deputy Barry advanced, is that it will be especially punitive on the lower paid and people on lower incomes generally.  We had a good deal of unspecified claims for what this budget does for the lower paid on the television programme to which Deputy Barry referred earlier.  On closer scrutiny, of course, that is not the situation because, what is given with one hand is taken away with the other.  This will be especially discriminatory against lower income groups because for example, the entire area of fuels and heating generally will now be charged at the rate of 12.5 per cent.  It goes without saying that people in the lower income groups use a great deal more of their disposable income on domestic heating than those who are better off.  They will be especially hit by this and, as I read the resolution, this year we have dispensed with the formula &mdash; which was a bit of a sham in any event &mdash; for which the Taoiseach argued very cogently last year, in respect of the proposition to put a 10 per cent rate on the ESB and Telecom Éireann specifically.  The instruction was that those two companies must absorb that rate.  Most Opposition Members argued that that would not happen in practice and that it would, inevitably, percolate to the consumer.  In the resolution before us tonight there is no such proposition as I understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear &mdash; and I do not think one can be clear from the resolution &mdash; whether it is proposed that it is the difference between 10 per cent and 12.5 per cent that will not be absorbed or whether the entire amount will be passed on to <Col N="1174" /> telephone, heating and ESB bills.  In any event, it will disproportionately impact on those in society who can least afford it.  It is especially regrettable for that reason; it, of course, minimises the slight advantage to social welfare recipients getting marginally above the probable inflation rate.  It certainly does not make any sense in terms of some of the areas which are excluded from VAT in the original Act, for example, the reference to specific share dealings.  I cannot understand why that kind of transaction is excluded whereas this proposition is included.  For that reason, we will be opposing this resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget has done nothing for employment and this resolution, which increases the rate of VAT from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent, is clearly an attack on employment in the service areas such as restaurants, hairdressers and, more importantly, in the repair and maintenance of all classes of equipment, motor cars, household equipment and so on.</P>
      <P>I am sure I do not need to remind Members of the House of the importance of making goods which will last.  We are in the middle of a major energy crisis and the manufacture of capital goods is a very heavy user of energy.  Most of our energy comes from the Middle East which is a very unstable area at the moment and is likely to remain so for a very long time. Anything which would encourage people to purchase a new car instead of repairing an old one is welcome.  That is why we tabled these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity to outline some of the reasons we oppose this resolution and agree with the tenor of the amendments to the proposal to increase the rate of VAT from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent on such essential items as fuel for heating, light and power, telecommunications, personal services, repair and maintenance services, adults' clothing and footwear.  Those are the items which caused problems in a budget some years ago but it appears that the <Col N="1175" /> Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government had no difficulty with increasing the rate on these items.</P>
      <P>When the rate of 10 per cent was initially applied to ESB and telephone bills the instruction given was that the cost involved was to be absorbed by the companies.  Can we be told this evening whether the whole bill will be paid by the consumer or if an instruction will be given to the companies to absorb the increase of 2.5 per cent in the rate of VAT.</P>
      <P>I would say there is some element of discretionary spending in relation to goods to which the highest rates are applied.  While one would welcome the reduction in the highest rate, there is certainly more discretion in terms of the purchase of those goods than in the purchase of the goods we are now talking about.  The increase in the rate of VAT from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent will have a far heavier impact on low income families and those families least able to carry the burden as they have no discretion in terms of their heating, light and power requirements.  With regard to repair and maintenance services, adults' clothing and footwear, there is minimal discretion as opposed to the position in respect of the white goods area where the high tax rates are applied.</P>
      <P>One other salient fact is that the increases in social welfare will take effect from July whereas the increase in the VAT rates will take effect immediately. This will obviously lead to some severe discomfort for social welfare recipients. When one takes into account the increase in local authority rents which will take effect very shortly, one can only wonder how the Government can say that this budget will be of help to low income families when this measure is going to penalise social welfare recipients and low income families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should the Minister for Finance have been a bit more forthcoming in relation to what the EC is looking for? He stated that the rate on building and tourism items will not be touched, that the rate <Col N="1176" /> will remain at 10 per cent until harmonisation takes effect.  Would the Taoiseach clarify what the signals are in relation to harmonisation and if on this occasion we are saying that this is a temporary measure and that the rate for all of these items is going to end up at between 16 per cent and 18 per cent following the harmonisation of VAT rates? We will oppose this measure because we believe it is unwarranted in present financial circumstances and the compensatory factors in the budget will not offset the increase in the rate of VAT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned and disappointed that the Government have ignored this opportunity to address the question of harmonisation in a meaningful fashion given that they will have to meet it head on next year.  They have merely tinkered with this thorny problem and a reduction of 2 per cent is inadequate. I would have thought, as we approach 1992, that they would have taken the opportunity to close the gap which at present stands at six percentage points.  Coupled with the increase in the rate of VAT on items such as clothing and footwear, this will further encourage hordes of people from the South to cross the Border &mdash; the bleeding haemorrhage in the sides of retailers who have to eke out a living in the Border areas - and it marks a continuation of the uncaring response of all Governments in the recent past to the plight of the unfortunate and hapless traders who are trying to exist in an economic wasteland, the result of the domestic policies of successive Governments in the recent past.  I had expected the Minister to address that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also disappointed he has failed to address the problems facing the many people engaged in the customs clearance area.  In my home town of Dundalk over 400 people depend on this area for their living.  These include many public servants who have lived in the town for many years and are engaged in the customs and revenue offices.  It also includes 150 people from the private sector.  These people have been pilloried and harassed by the Revenue Commissioners in recent <Col N="1177" /> years and have been made to instal very expensive equipment such as computers. They are now going to be left high and dry.  The Minister has refused to address their plight.  Will they be paid compensation and are the Government going to seek compensation from Europe? Those are very pertinent questions for those living in the border area.  I ask the Taoiseach to give me some definite answer to the question of what is to become of those in the public sector who have served Ireland for many years.</P>

      <P>In the debate on the previous resolution the Taoiseach stated that road tax for commercial vehicles is three times higher in Britain but if we take into account additional duties and taxes, not all of which can be claimed back &mdash; not every road haulier is registered for value added tax &mdash; a £56 million penalty has been imposed on the industry according to the estimate of the freight industry.</P>
      <P>With regard to telecommunications charges, the Government arranged that value added tax would be added to all telephone bills from I January last but because most commercial enterprises are registered for VAT and their turnover exceeds £15,000 per year they will be able to reclaim VAT.  However, private subscribers and those companies with a turnover of less than £15,000 will not be able to do so.  Arrangements have been made for Telecom Éireann to meet the 10 per cent charge by making changes in the cost of telephone calls to the private subscriber but these do not take account of any additional increases.  For instance, if the rate of 12.5 per cent is applied, a 2.5 per cent penalty will be imposed immediately on domestic users, and God only knows what will happen next year if Telecom Eireann withdraw their support. We would then find that the rate of VAT being charged on the bills of private subscribers and those commercial enterprises with a turnover of less than £15,000 is 12.5 per cent, 2.5 per cent of which will be applied from I March next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary as we move towards harmonisation that we will now have a <Col N="1178" /> fourth rate.  At present there is a zero rate, a 10 per cent rate and a 23 per cent rate in existence but the Minister for Finance is proposing to reduce the 23 per cent rate to 21 per cent and create a new rate of 12.5 per cent.  That does not represent a move towards harmonisation, rather it is a move in the other direction.  A variety of rates is being introduced and I can only presume from what has been said today that the intention is to increase the rate of 12.5 per cent towards 18 per cent and bring the rate of 21 per cent down towards that rate so that eventually the high rate will be applied to almost everything.  I presume a new rate would be created which would then be applied to those goods which are at present zero rated.</P>
    <P>This increase must be opposed.  It is very clear that it will have serious implications not only for industry but also for the private subscriber who has not yet received his or her telephone bill which will carry a charge for VAT for the first time.  That charge will be offset to some extent by the reduction in Telecom Eireann charges.  However, if Telecom Eireann are able now to reduce the cost of domestic telephone calls by 10 per cent, why did they not do it last year? If they are doing it this year, why do the Government step in and say that is all very well so we are going to stop another 10 per cent VAT &mdash; or 12½ per cent as it will now be - and have our share? It is a very undesirable practice that we should pass legislation which will come into effect 12 months hence, because this is a charge on telephone calls.  It is being increased here tonight and, I suspect, if it is passed it will be increased yet again in next year's budget.</P>

The Chair is anxious to facilitate the Deputies in question but brevity is essential in that the question on resolution No. 4 must be put at 10.15 p.m.  If Members will be brief the Chair will facilitate all concerned.

      <P>I want to speak against the <Col N="1179" /> proposed increase from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent VAT on fuel for heating.  If my memory serves me right, this time last year we were speaking about the same issue <i>vis-à-vis</i> ESB and Telecom Éireann charges.  It is particularly insensitive that at this time of the year we should be arguing for increasing heating fuel costs to the public given the attempts by two Ministers, Deputies Harney and Flynn, to create smoke control zones and a smoke free environment which, on one level, was successful in that air pollution levels are quite satisfactory, but they would be satisfactory if you arbitrarily ban the burning of bituminous coal.</P>
      <P>However, when you relate that to the difficulties caused for the consumer, particularly low income and social welfare recipients of whom there are hundreds of thousands, you see the real implications for them will be quite severe.  In most areas outside Ballyfermot this year they were forced arbitrarily to stop burning bituminous coal, their traditional fuel which to the vast bulk of people was an expensive fuel, and use an alternative smokeless fuel &mdash;&ldquo;Coalite&rdquo; or some other brand &mdash; which was more costly than coal.  These people are to be rewarded this year by having the cost of alternative fuels increased yet again.  The media seem to have been taken in to some degree, and this morning we heard the Minister lauding the fact that he has granted old age pensioners an increase. Old age pensioners will get a miserable £2 per week increase.  I do not think that is anything to be proud of.</P>

Coupled with that will be the increase in their ESB bill.  The kernel of my argument is that it is a farce to praise yourself for giving them an increase of £2 and then to take away the bulk of that increase on the items I have listed &mdash; heat, light and power.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like clarification from the Taoiseach on one point, and perhaps he will give me some guidance in his reply.  It is in regard to personal services.  At present an accountant's fees for doing farm accounts are rated at 10 per cent, it appears this will be increased to 12,5 per cent.  Similarly if a farmer is purchasing land or anything of that nature, the fee is 10 per cent and it appears that is to be increased to 12.5 per cent.  Accountants' fees are quite high and a further 2.5 per cent will increase the burden.</P>
      <P>Repairs to agricultural machinery, such as tractors, combine harvesters, mowers and so on, is at present subject to VAT at 10 per cent and it seems that figure is to be increased to 12.5 per cent also.  I do not intend speaking on the problems facing the farming community, but although an additional 2.5 per cent may not appear to be very much, it can be a strain on a farmer's financial resources.  An exemption has been granted for the agricultural community in the 10 per cent VAT rate; will that be increased to 12.5 per cent?</P>
      <P>A major problem is confronting the country in regard to disease eradication in farm animals.  The Minister mentioned what is required by EC law.  I live in a rural area and know veterinary surgeons who, at the moment, have difficulty collecting fees from farmers because they are unable to pay them.  An increase to 12.5 per cent will make a bad situation worse for the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to repeat what other people have said, but an increase of 2.5 per cent on items such as heating oil, turf, briquettes and all types of fuel, will cause many serious problems.  The cost of fuel <Col N="1181" /> is very high.  Elderly people in particular will face difficulty and hardship trying to pay their bills to keep warm, especially in March and April when this increase is introduced.  I will be voting against this measure.</P>
    <P>The increase will also apply to clothing and footwear for adults and will also affect boys and girls of 17 and 18 years of age perhaps from big families, who are still attending school.  As a result this increase will cause hardship for many people.  In addition to the zero rate, there are two VAT levels at the moment.  On the last occasion the Government made a virtue of reducing the rates to 10 per cent and 23 per cent.  The Taoiseach has gone from virtue to I now not where.  I oppose this proposal.  It was correct to have two rates but to add a third and then a fourth is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As I come from a border area, let me say that reducing the high rate of VAT from 23 per cent to 21 per cent may be laudable but it is not realistic if we are talking about VAT harmonisation for next year.  We will have one more budget to bring the VAT rate down another 6 per cent.  Excise duty on top of that will mean unfair competition for traders in the border area. Also the increase from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent VAT on certain items will increase overheads for business people in all areas, but specifically in border areas. In County Leitrim alone the largest employer is the service industry, the section of the business community that will be affected by the harmonisation of VAT.  Unless action is taken immediately the few people endeavouring to survive in business in border areas will not remain.  It is a very serious problem which must be taken on board immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a couple of points.  First of all, the Minister's notably chatty speech for television has led to some obscurities in the stylistic change.  For example, I am not clear what is meant when he said the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> Responsible action by the business community is good - for the business community.  Consumers should support outlets that quickly reflect VAT reductions in their prices.  And where that quick reflection does not happen it must inevitably influence the Government's long term approach to this whole area. </P>
    <P>I do not know what that means.  Perhaps we could be enlightened in that regard. Moreover, it is not clear what is meant by the following:</P>
    <P>At present less than 40 per cent of all consumer goods and services attract the standard rate of VAT.  The thrust of current EC policy is to significantly increase this share... </P>
    <P>I am not sure how this is to be achieved because raising the lower rate does not increase the proportionate standard share.  This raises the whole question &mdash; which is not made clear to us &mdash; as to what is the objective of this.  Are we aiming, as would appear to be the case &mdash; perhaps I am wrong in this &mdash; at moving over three stages to a 17 per cent or 17.5 per cent rate, merging the two rates? Is that what is implicit? Surely we should be told what is this movement referred to in such an odd style in the Minister's remarks.  If that is the case, then how do we reconcile the net cost of this &mdash; estimated at £37 million for this tranche &mdash; with the figure of £600 million for the whole exercise, admittedly including excise duties, in our discussions with the EC? It would appear that if one can move a third of the way towards bringing the two rates together at 17 per cent or 17.5 per cent at a cost of £37 million, one could do the whole job for approximately £100 million but that is not the kind of figure that is spoken of; hundreds and hundreds of millions of pounds have been spoken of as the cost of this harmonisation. I accept that part of that is comprised of excise duties &mdash; and that we are not going to harmonise excise duties &mdash; but we need some clarification of that. The Minister does not explain what this <Col N="1183" /> exercise is about.  We ought to be told that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the problem we face and inherent in the whole budget is that we do not know the strategy behind the Minister's tactics.  As Deputy FitzGerald has said, we should know what is the ultimate aim. Also, part of our problem has been that we hung around since 1987 waiting for the EC to take decisions without forcing the pace ourselves. Now we are endeavouring to cram everything into the last couple of years.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest disincentives to the creation of jobs and wealth is our level of personal taxation.  Without more personal incentive we will not be able to create more employment opportunities. When one examines today's budget one sees that the ordinary household will now be faced with increased charges for heating, light and power in addition to telecommunications. If one is in business one can reclaim VAT but, at the end of the day, we must remember that the ordinary consumer will be caught for these increases.  Equally, if one examines how the Minister proposes to fund the reduction in the standard rate of VAT from 23 per cent to 21 per cent, one discovers he is adding 2.5 per cent, VAT on certain goods and services, increasing road taxes and the price of cigarettes, so that consumers will carry the entire burden.  There is no point in talking about the miserable reductions in personal taxation when, with the other hand, one must give away such benefits straightaway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one talks about an inflation rate of 2 per cent, ask any housewife going to the supermarket to shop at the weekend, when she will tell you she does not perceive inflation at 2 per cent because the cost of living, affecting the ordinary person in the street, is way above the inflation figures quoted on a daily basis. Again, we are faced with circumstances in which the consumer must carry everything, including extra road tax; if one smokes, an extra 10p on a packet of 20 cigarettes and, in addition, 2.5 per cent <Col N="1184" /> extra for heat, light and fuel.  If one has a telephone one will be charged also.  One will even be charged an extra 2.5 per cent for a hair cut in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not think this has anything to do with VAT harmonisation or with a policy of reducing the load on the ordinary taxpayer. Once again the Government saw fit to interfere with commercial State bodies, imposing a tax and then expecting bodies such as Telecom Éireann and the ESB to carry such charges.  Surely we have reached the stage at which commercial State companies should be allowed operate in a commercial manner and, if they can absorb this extra charge, why did they not reduce their prices before now? I am sure we will be told later that they will be able to absorb this additional increase.  That is no way to run any company. A company should be enabled to run on its own two feet, make a profit and provide a service at the cheapest possible rate, thereby helping our economy.</P>
    <P>I join my colleagues in opposing this increase in VAT of 2.5 per cent, from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent a little time this evening engaging in some political reminiscing. We should not move away from this issue this evening without recognising the fact that we are celebrating something of an anniversary.  It is, I think, just nine years ago that a general election was called, when the Fianna Fáil Party - as a major plank of that election - opposed the imposition of VAT on shoes and clothing.  We have seen a number of conversions on the Road to Damascus in the past three years.  I suppose the imposition from zero rating to 12.5 per cent rating of VAT on shoes and clothing in this budget must be the ultimate, one of the remaining U-turns this Taoiseach needed to take to give the lie to the approach adopted by Fianna Fail to fiscal issues during the early eighties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the view that this budget is a patently dishonest one.  The imposition of VAT on shoes, clothing, telecommunications and the other services has ensured that, whereas in the context <Col N="1185" /> of income tax the Minister has been pretending to give relief, what he has given with one hand he has taken back with the other.  Within the context of the imposition of VAT on shoes and clothing it is quite clear that that section of the community it is alleged will benefit from social welfare increases in reality will not benefit at all.  It is those people dependent on social welfare, be they married couples, or elderly people, who will find whatever benefits they receive on the one hand are taken back by the State on the other.  This will extend to the widow living alone in Kerry with a young married daughter in Dublin, whose only contact with her is by way of telephone and who will be taxed every time she makes a telephone call simply to maintain contact with her daughter and perhaps grandchildren living in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the phraseology of what we are at in the context of the VAT impositions, in particular with regard to clothing and footwear because I am not sure how the Government intend to implement this.  Perhaps the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste could enlighten us.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the imposition of VAT at 12.5 per cent on adults' clothing and footwear.  Could the Taoiseach indicate how this provision will apply? When will an item of clothing be designated as being for an adult or a child? Will it depend on the size of the foot or the size of the clothing? Will small adults not pay VAT on their clothes while tall children will? Will children with big feet pay VAT on shoes while adults with small feet will not? Perhaps the Taoiseach could clarify all this for the House this evening, because I am not sure where the dividing parameter is.  I am not sure how it will apply.  Will we have VAT inspectors hanging around shoe shops looking for the birth certificates of the purchasers of shoes to check the age of the purchaser or the age of the person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who will wear the <Col N="1186" /> shoes? What about clothing? What happens to the teenager who is between 5'6&rdquo; and 5'8&rdquo; who goes into an adults clothes shop to buy, for instance, a size 14i shirt which size his father also buys? How can we designate what VAT applies to? We should clarify this.</P>
      <P>I recall the Taoiseach on this side of the House and on the hustings in 1982 raising these questions and causing great roars of mirth from the ranks of Fianna Fail supporters on every election platform on which he stood.  We now have the Taoiseach saying that we will have zero rating on clothes and shoes for children and a 12.5 per cent rating for clothes and shoes for adults.  Prior to a vote on this issue it should be clarified in the House: will clothes be determined on the basis of style, size, type of materials used or cost? Are particular shoes more prone to be worn by teenagers as opposed to young adults? I do not know the answers to these questions but it is certainly not clear from the resolution before the House how we will give effect to implementing the measure the Minister for Finance has announced.  That should be clarified because the shopkeepers on I March 1991 will have to implement this.  Apparently at the exhortation of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will send his minions out to promptly police the measure.  In fairness to the Minister for Industry and Commerce he should know what he is policing.  These are issues which are sufficiently serious in the fiscal area to deserve clarification before we vote on them.</P>
      <P>Gestures from the Taoiseach do not clarify matters one way or the other, no matter how insulting the Taoiseach may try to be in making gestures that no doubt he regards as suitable to make off camera but not appropriate on camera.  I am raising a serious issue, an issue that deserves clarification, an issue that is not clarified in the resolution which is the legal matter before the House which will determine the imposition of VAT on those items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If VAT was to be imposed on these items, an imposition of VAT on these items, to protect the poorer sections, <Col N="1187" /> should have required from this Government a greater increase in social welfare than has been provided and greater reliefs in the tax area for those who are in employment with incomes below the basic industrial wage.  This proposal clearly indicates that the Taoiseach and the Government are not coming to terms either socially or fiscally with the impact of the measures that are required for harmonisation of taxes as we head into 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax side of this budget is a dreadful muddle and nowhere is that more clear than in relation to this proposal on VAT.  By my calculations the Minister relieves taxation in the budget today to the tune of £170 million.  I am talking now of the taxes that effect people's spending power - income tax, indirect taxes, capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax.  On the other hand, the Minister put new impositions of about £134 million so that in fact what the Minister gave back net, in terms of taxation, comes to a total of £36 million.  That will not have a great effect one way or the other on economic activity or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is when we look at how that is composed that we see just how big the muddle is and what little strategy there is in any of this.  We cannot see where the Government are going on indirect taxation of any kind, least of all on VAT.  When one looks at the overall tax picture and the detailed measures there is not any apparent benefit in prospect for either consumers or producers.  Consumers are getting little back out of it and there is no benefit for producers because there is no plan that will make our VAT system or indirect tax system any less onerous on the competitiveness of industry.  We are advised by the Commission of the European Communities that neighbouring states that have a common land border can sustain differences between them in VAT rates of around 2 per cent or even more without that causing any distortion of trade.  Our nearest neighbour has a VAT rate of 15 per cent which <Col N="1188" /> suggests that we should be heading for a VAT rate of 17 per cent as a standard rate long term, taking account of all the other issues that have to be dealt with while we get there.  Is that what this is heading for? We do not know.  The Minister did not make any statement about this today.</P>
    <P>Looking at the figures before us and quickly calculating, it seems that to move down from the 23 per cent rate costs in a full year about £58 million per point reduction.  We could probably take that on a straight line basis because we are dealing with a single mass of products taxed at the single rate.  To move up from the 10 per cent rate, for the products that are covered by the change that is being proposed, nets the Exchequer about £29 million per annum per point.  It seems that if we were to move from where we were just before this budget to a 17 per cent single VAT rate, the total cost of moving down from 23 per cent to 17 per cent would be about £350 million in a full year and the total gain from moving up from 10 per cent to 17 per cent would be £200 million in a full year giving a net cost to the Exchequer in a full year of £150 million.  That seems to be at least an arguable basis on which a strategy for VAT could be put forward here, but we see nothing of that.  All we see are two apparently unconnected measures, the one a move from 23 per cent to 21 per cent to give the appearance of movement in relation to VAT, the other a move from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent that is not justified by any other consideration but the fact that that will net the Exchequer £61.3 million this year.  There is not a plan behind it or a strategy of any kind.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach tell me and the House if there has been any consideration of what our strategy might be for harmonising our VAT rates to a level that would leave us competitive in the border areas and elsewhere, to a level that we could sustain in competition with the rest of the European Community and in a way that would allow our tax system to be taken into account when we are looking at the effects of the inevitable move <Col N="1189" /> upwards on people with less ability to bear the cost that would be associated with that.  There is not a strategy here at all.  I would like the Taoiseach to tell us if there is even a glimmer of a view in the Government about what such a strategy might be, in the event that they decide to take this seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance set a long term objective to reduce income tax by a certain percentage over a period of time.  It is regrettable that he did not state his objective in relation to VAT.  VAT harmonisation will be necessary in the near future and I regret that he did not say what percentage he is aiming to achieve.  It is frustrating that we do not have this information.  People have stated why they are opposed to the increase from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  At Listowel races we have a famous person called the &ldquo;Three Card Trick Man&rdquo; who arrives with a collapsible table, asks one to find the lady and, exercising skill and manual dexterity with cards, it is a matter of 'now you see her, now you do not'.  It is the same in relation to this budget.  What the Minister giveth the Minister taketh away very quickly.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that previous VAT reductions were not passed on to the customer and that some businesses were very slow to reduce prices.  What type of businesses were these? What percentage did they represent? Did they ever pass on the VAT cut? What mechanism was used to monitor them? All these questions need to be answered.  We are hearing a lot of pious old nonsense.  It has been said that consumers should support outlets which quickly reflect VAT reductions in their prices.  I am sure consumers will be bewildered unless this is properly monitored and effectively policed from the beginning.  The increase from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent is a retrograde step which is anti-employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Financial Resolution No. 4 is entirely unsatisfactory.  At one stage today I heard the Minister mention <Col N="1190" /> 20 per cent as if he were thinking of another little jump to 20 per cent next year.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will clarify the position.  I understand two bands were suggested for the Single Market, namely 4-9 per cent and 14-19 per cent. I understood from informal contacts that we were considering the high rate to be pitched here at 19 per cent.  Studies would suggest that that would be tolerable.  A 5 per cent difference in VAT, all other things being equal, would be tolerable in the economy vis-a-vis our near neighbours. We really do not know what is happening here.  Are we moving from the new 12.5 per cent rate towards 19 per cent next year and moving from 21 per cent back to 19 per cent? We do not know and there is a lot of confusion.  That should be clarified.</P>
      <P>The cut of 2 per cent in the top rate is not at all acceptable to me, Deputy McGahon, Deputy Gerry Reynolds and others living in the Border counties.  It is simply a knee-jerk in the direction of a problem we have had for years.  I notice when discussing these matters with Ministers that they alternately agree and disagree with regard to the nature of the problem.  They disagree here in debate, yet they run to Brussels asking for special concessions to prevent people crossing into the North to do their shopping. There is a credibility problem there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That reduction of 2 per cent would be quite interesting and acceptable but for the major cost penalities in our economy which have not been addressed.  VAT at point of entry is a running sore in the Border counties because it adds three-quarters of I per cent to the cost of a product.  That is unacceptable.  We have all sorts of other cost penalties.  Wholesalers in our area are now crossing the Border, buying their goods there, bringing them back quite legally and selling those products far cheaper than if they had purchased them in this economy.  For a long time that did not happen because people were afraid to do so.  It would have been thought to be non-Republican to move into the North and buy goods in that economy for transport south. However, they are certainly doing it now. <Col N="1191" /> I know it because I have regular contact with them.  The reduction of 2 per cent will not help us in our difficulties.  The Government know that well.  The Minister mentioned today that the 36-hour rule or whatever new rule he has in mind has been agreed for implementation. That makes it obvious to everybody that the problem is still festering.  On that basis I have no option but to oppose Financial Resolution No. 4.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that protecting and improving the living standards of disadvantaged people has to be an integral part of the Government's overall strategy. He also said:</P>

    <P>It is important that the Government and the Minister for Finance see fit to emphasise the need to protect the disadvantaged, of whom there are very many.  Financial Resolution No. 4 exposes what will happen as a result of this budget, namely, that the very small increases given to the old, to widows, to people on social welfare will be taken back by the VAT increases, particularly on fuel, clothing and other commodities. Old people in particular must buy fuel, especially throughout the increasingly harsh winters.  Deputy Byrne clearly stated that as a result of Government policy the fuel people use has become more expensive.  I know from representing an area where there are very <Col N="1192" /> many disadvantaged that people already have great difficulty in affording fuel. What is the message going out from this caring Government today? They intend to increase the cost of fuel yet again. If for no other reason, that ensures my opposition to Financial Resolution No. 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few fundamental points in regard to this discussion.  The net effect of these two changes is to give £37 million back to the consumers.  The Minister is not in these two changes taking any more money from the consumers.  They are the net beneficiaries of £37 million.  Everybody seems to be forgetting that the standard rate is the one which affects consumers most and the Minister is reducing it by I per cent.  The Minister could not attempt to do that if he did not increase the other rate from 10 per cent to 12½ per cent.</P>
      <P>I distinguished two main trends in the discussion here.  One is the argument about harmonisation and the other is about lower income families.  Deputy Gregory is very eloquent about the poor and the disadvantaged.  I just want to gently suggest to him that this Government, in the last few years, have done more for the poor and disadvantaged overall than any other Government.  He was talking about old people and their fuel needs.  He is talking to the person in this House who introduced very special provisions to provide heating and fuel for the older people in this country.  So I do not particularly want or value any lectures on caring or charity or provisions for the old and disadvantaged from Deputy Gregory.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a point about the effect of this on lower income families as this seems to be a main argument put forward.  I will begin with Deputy Rabbitte's argument.  The simple facts are that the average shopping basket of the lower income family is about 40 per cent food, and food is zero rated.  Of <Col N="1193" /> the remaining 2 per cent reduction in the standard rate will be far more important to the lower income families than to anybody else.  Of the remaining 60 per cent, by far the largest proportion of the lower income family will benefit from the 2 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not talk rubbish. By and large, this change will benefit lower income families and the average household budget.  These are facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other thing I want to talk about is harmonisation.  This is a direct process towards harmonisation in accordance with the pending EC requirements and I really believe that the Deputies are misleading themselves to suggest otherwise. It could not be clearer.  On the one hand we are bringing the top rate down from 23 per cent to 21 per cent to get near what will ultimately be the standard rate.  On the other hand we are bringing in a range of items, which ultimately will have to go into that standard rate, up nearer the standard rate and achieving a reasonable balance so far as the consumer is concerned by giving him or her back £37 million.  The position with regard to harmonisation at EC level at the moment is not by any means clear, it is not by any means definite, but we do know the general thrust of what is happening.  It is likely that the standard rate will finish up somewhere between 14 per cent and 20 per cent and the lower rate somewhere between 4 per cent and 9 per cent and there may or may not be a zero rate. In so far as the standard rate will be somewhere between 14 per cent and 20 per cent, everybody must surely agree that by bringing our top standard rate down we are moving somewhere near where we should be.  On the other hand, certainly the majority of items we are putting up from 10 per cent to 12½ per cent will ultimately have to go into the standard rate category.  There are ones we are leaving at 10 per cent and there are ones that are likely to go down to the 4 per cent to 9 per cent bracket.  All <Col N="1194" /> in all it is a totally logical progression towards the harmonisation that will eventually emerge.</P>
    <P>The other main argument put forward was by the Border area Deputies, and I really think they are just attempting to mislead the House completely on this matter, particularly Deputy McGahon who said successive Governments did nothing for the Border traders.  Did you ever hear such a fundamental misstatement of the position in this House?</P>
    <P>One of the first things Deputy McSharry as Minister for Finance did was to deal with that situation.  Let me remind Deputy McGahon that it was the Government which he supported and the Government of which Deputy Dukes was a Minister which piled on tax after tax down here which caused a total disruption of trade between here and the North, so let him please not lecture me on the Border areas and who does anything for them and who does not.</P>

      <P>One particular question was asked which I think is significant and that is about the increase of 2½ per cent with regard to the ESB and Bord Telecom.  We had a big discussion on that point last year and we indicated that the 10 per cent should be absorbed, and it was absorbed.  We are not asking those two companies this year, in spite of what somebody was saying over there, to absorb the 2½ per cent.  Whether they can or not is a matter for themselves in accordance with their commercial requirements, but there is no reason the existing 10 per cent which has been absorbed should be changed in any way. That is the answer to that particular point.</P>
      <P>I think this is a very sensible change. It is a very definite move towards the sort of situation we envisage as likely to emerge from the present negotiations on harmonisation.  It is an intelligent move in anticipation of that from both directions. In particular, I want to again say that the Minister is giving back £37 million to consumers in this area.  So far as the lower income families are concerned, my estimate of the situation is that by the reduction of the 2 per cent in the standard top rate the vast majority of lower income families will in fact benefit.</P>

    <P>This resolution carries into effect the changes in the business expansion scheme which were announced in the budget speech to take effect in respect of shares issued on or after today.  The changes being introduced are as follows: first, the scheme which was due to expire on 5 April is being extended for two years. Second, shipping, hotels, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation are being excluded from its ambit from now on.  The BES will still, of course, apply to manufacturing and certain international services, advance factories, special trading houses, tourist facilities other than the ones I have mentioned.  Third, the £2.5 million limit will be reduced to £500,000 and, finally, a lifetime cap of £50,000 is being placed on the extent to which any individual investor may benefit from a BES scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (2) (e), to delete subparagraph (iii). </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to restore the benefits which the business expansion scheme have bestowed on the <Col N="1202" /> tourist industry for the last number of years.  I am amazed that any Minister for Tourism and Transport should allow this to happen when it is patently obvious to anybody who lives along the western seaboard particularly, but in other tourist areas as well, that this scheme has been of benefit to the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget Statement said that the BES scheme cost £40 million last year.  The point to be made about this scheme is that it is an incentive scheme.  It is an incentive to people to invest.  If the incentive did not exist, then people would not invest.  It is as simple as that.  Therefore, there is no loss to the Exchequer because the investment would not have been made unless the scheme was in place.  To pretend that the scheme has cost the Exchequer x amount of money, in this case £40 million, is not correct because investments would not be made or at least would not be made on the same scale unless the projects concerned were built and employment provided. Because employment is provided we are concerned that it should remain in place. It was originally designed to encourage investment in industries in the manufacturing sector and afterwards it was extended to include shipping and the tourist industry.  It is obvious that there have been abuses of the scheme in the last number of years.  I do not think anybody wants to defend it in the building of houses in the suburbs of any one of the cities or towns of Ireland.  That was not the intention of the business expansion scheme for tourism.</P>
    <P>Those on the west coast, on the south coast or in any of the major tourist regions will see that many hotels and guesthouses have been refurbished, updated, refurnished and are totally different establishments now from what they were five years ago before this scheme came into effect.  There is no doubt that when the tourist industry is under threat, as it is at present because of the Gulf crisis and the knock-on effects on travel from all over the world but particularly from America and Great Britain, whose economies are in recession, any help the tourism industry can get should be <Col N="1203" /> allowed to them.  We are putting down this amendment to draw attention to the fact that we want to see the tourism industry helped in this regard and we want to see the business expansion scheme so structured that hotels and guesthouses can continue to avail of it.  I should like to know the intentions of the Minister and the Taoiseach in that regard.  We will support any provision in the Finance Bill which will have the effect of closing off the abuses in the scheme to which I have referred.  I understand the scheme has not operated very successfully in the area of shipping.  The Government will have our support for any provision which will eliminate abuses provided they restructure the scheme in order to allow the present benefits to the tourism industry, particularly in the hotel and guesthouse sectors, to continue for a number of years.</P>
    <P>It appears the Government are being somewhat despondent in their approach to this issue.  The double capping provision they have proposed, that is, a cap on the total amount which can be invested in any one scheme and a cap on the amount of benefit any one individual can receive in his lifetime from an investment, seems to indicate it is their intention that the scheme should wither away. The manufacturing industry will not benefit from this scheme in the future if this double capping proposal is introduced. If it is the Government's intention to eventually do away with the scheme they should be more honest and say so now. The people in the construction industry who have depended very much on the business expansion scheme for employment should be told if it is the Government's intention to make the conditions in regard to investment so tightly drawn in the future that the amount of investment will be practically minimal and they will not have the benefit of this scheme in the future.</P>
    <P>Our amendment seeks to ensure that the tourism industry will continue to benefit from the scheme, that any amendments which are introduced to the Finance Bill will enable abuses of the <Col N="1204" /> scheme &mdash; these must be very apparent to the officials in the Department and the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; to be weeded out, that the benefits of the scheme will be left in place and that the capping provision will not be implemented.  Putting a cap of £50,000 on the amount a person may invest in his lifetime is very restrictive &mdash; it is not much more than the price of a good quality house at present &mdash; and will limit the amount many legitimate investors will invest in schemes.  I ask the Government to consider my amendment in that light.</P>
    <P>We want the benefits of the business expansion scheme to be restored to hotels and guesthouses.  We will support any provision in the Finance Bill which will weed out any abuses of the business expansion scheme which undoubtedly there have been over the past number of years.  I also ask the Government to look again at the capping level they propose to impose on the total amount any one person can invest.  It is possible that a person could invest in more than one scheme thus giving employment in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We realise that the business expansion scheme has been misused by some beneficiaries over the years. Indeed, on numerous occasions the Labour Party have pointed out to the Government abuses of what was otherwise a very good scheme.  We are extremely concerned that the Minister has decided to exclude tourism from the list of beneficiaries of the scheme, an industry which we had hoped would show growth this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out today, in spite of our best efforts there will be difficulties in this industry.  It is for this reason we had hoped the tourism industry would not be penalised by the Government. We are both surprised and concerned at the Minister's decision to include tourism in the list of industries on <Col N="1205" /> which he proposes to do a hatchet job. We should like to see the scheme operating as it was intended to by the House so that it can trigger off development in this area.  If tax incentives are needed to create employment in this industry we could go along with such a proposal in the hope that it would create growth in the economy and jobs, an issue which the budget has failed to address.</P>
    <P>May I refer to the general issue of income tax?  This resolution deals with income tax and certain limitations are placed on income tax in the budget.  I am not sure if it is possible for me to refer to this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  Of all the incentives available to industry and businessmen which are supposed to be incentives but which turn out to be tax shelters, this is the one that has probably <Col N="1206" /> been most grossly abused.  In the case of the notorious Shannon leasing case, highlighted I think by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his last report, something like £27 million was raised and only seven jobs created.  This House cannot stand over that kind of scandal.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this scheme was to raise seed capital for risk-prone ventures.  All of us could agree with that but it has turned out to be a tax haven, a source of tax relief, for investors in asset rich investments.  That was not the purpose of the scheme.  Therefore, there is some conflict in that all of us on all sides of the House agree we cannot allow this situation to go on, that it must be tightened up, but when it is tightened up we say, &ldquo;that is not the particular loophole I would have shut off&rdquo;.  In regard to the Fine Gael amendment, I appreciate that one could make particular arguments, especially in the present climate, in favour of tourism.  It is probably the area which will be most calamitously hit as a result of the Gulf War but I honestly do not think that some of the projects which have been raised on the basis of this scheme, for example, in the hotel area, are the kind of projects which were envisaged by this scheme or that we should continue to tolerate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is evidence right through the Minister's script of double think on this issue.  If the Minister is really committed to the notion of a business expansion scheme for the purposes I mentioned earlier I cannot understand, as Deputy Barry mentioned, the proposal in regard to a lifetime cap of £50,000.  I would have thought that if we were seriously interested in raising seed capital for productive purposes that the more money we got the better.  I cannot see the merit in the present ceiling.  The reasoning, I am sure, is that the Minister does not want the same person who has used it as a tax shelter to come back time and again, but that defeats the purpose.  I do not have the figures off the top of my head but I know that the early years of this scheme showed clearly that before the accountancy profession got to work on it to ensure that it was practically risk free, <Col N="1207" /> virtually nothing was raised under the scheme.  Only when it was secure and risk free did it expand and was money raised in this fashion.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Barry when he says that this is an incentive to invest; if it was not there, there would be no investment and, therefore, there is no tax foregone to the State.  I cannot accept that.  The figure last year for tax foregone to the Exchequer was £40 million, and a similar figure is projected for this year if no action is taken.  It is not right to say that if the scheme did not exist that figure would not be there because it was a tax haven used by people who had £25,000 disposable income to put into such a scheme, and if that scheme did not exist, the naive presumption is that they would be paying tax on the money like the rest of us.  Of course we know there were other ruses open to them to avoid paying tax, and we will be going into that tomorrow. That is a matter for a wider debate.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to support the Fine Gael amendment.  This is the beginning of the end for the business expansion scheme.  What we have here shows a great deal of confusion in the minds of the Government about what loopholes they may or may not close off. Will the Taoiseach when replying comment on whether or not, for example, the exclusion of hotels, guesthouses and other accommodation also applies to youth hostels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make three brief points on this resolution.  One relates to the general principle referred to by Deputy Rabbitte which will be dealt with in the Finance Bill.  The idea of the business expansion scheme was a very good one.  It may be that it was used in the past couple of years as a tax shelter but that is not to say that the original idea was not a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience with the Revenue Commissioners it is safe to say that they never wanted a <Col N="1208" /> business expansion scheme.  I was never a member of any Government at any time but I am quite prepared to say that the Revenue Commissioners never wanted a business expansion scheme because they always knew that the tax practitioners and accountants would find ways of making it a tax shelter.  The principle behind the scheme is a good one and it is a pity that because of the abuses which everyone knows took place we are now going to throw out the baby with the bath water.  It is obvious that the Revenue Commissioners, and the Department of Finance, have convinced the Minister that this scheme is a bad one, that there are too many loopholes in it and given the Shannon case as an example.  Officials never advise a Minister to get rid of something straight away but rather to get rid of it by degrees, knowing that it will be made so ineffective that it is really no use to anybody.</P>
      <P>I have sympathy with the point put forward by Deputy Barry.  It is better to have people investing money in something concrete rather than have it lying in a bank account.  Surely there must be some project in whch they could invest which would generate jobs, and will be there for the future?  The first point I want to make is that we are throwing out the baby with the bath water and this is the end of the business expansion scheme.</P>
      <P>The second point I would like to raise is a more technical one.  It has been announced in the Minister's speech that if shares are not issued by today we are in trouble.  This is, effectively, retrospective legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is undoubtedly true that in the past couple of months people have been aware that some changes to this effect may be made in the Finance Bill, but they thought this scheme would last until 5 April 1991.  I know that funds have been raised and committed but shares have not been issued.  I would ask the Minister, with respect to everybody, to reconsider this <Col N="1209" /> matter before the publication of the Finance Bill.  From practicial experience of the business expansion scheme, a long process has to be gone through before a person gets the RICI 3 form &mdash; there are also RICT 1 and RICT 2 forms.  There are cases where funds were raised, even some time ago, but the shares may not necessarily have been issued.</P>
      <P>Not all the people about whom Deputy Rabbitte spoke have £25,000 in their hip pocket to invest in a scheme.  Many people, for example, where there are two teachers in a family, middle class people, may have a couple of thousand pounds to invest in such a scheme.  It is not only the people to whom Deputy Rabbitte referred such as the self-employed who have plenty of money who invest in such schemes.  Even people who live in Tallaght participated in this scheme.  It is the in thing to oppose all these schemes because supposedly it is the rich who participate in them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As today is the final date of issue many people will suffer hardship and a lot of schemes will not proceed.  I would ask the experts in the Revenue Commissioners to think again about this matter and maybe to defer the date of issue of the prospectus.  The first thing one needs in these cases is approval from the Revenue Commissioners, with the issuing of the RICT 1 form, but it may be a long way down the road before the share certificates are issued.  Tax changes are made very often and people find new ways around them.  This is retrospective legislation which will cause a lot of hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third point I want to make is that we are now reducing the total amount of money that can be raised by this scheme to £500,000.  If we, are sincere about the business expansion scheme we should be increasing it rather than reducing it.  If, in the Finance Bill, the Minister abolished the business expansion scheme it <Col N="1210" /> would be more honest than withdrawing it as he is doing here.  I am not blaming the Minister but I can certainly see the hands of a number of experts &mdash; I have great friends in the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, people for whom I have great respect &mdash; who want to get rid of this scheme at any cost.  I believe in calling a spade a spade, and if the Minister is going to get rid of this scheme he should do so and stop &ldquo;mickey mousing&rdquo; around with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that this proposal amounts to a hammer-blow to the tourist industry.  It is very clear that that industry is going to suffer blows as a result of the Gulf War but the effect of this proposal will be far worse than any effect from the Gulf War.  I come from one of the premier tourist areas in the country and I see in my area the benefits of the business expansion scheme in the improvement of hotels and the establishment of self-catering accommodation, the kind of development that would not have taken place were it not for that scheme.  I accept that there were abuses in the scheme and I accept the point raised by Deputy Rabbitte about the Shannon leasing company, but because there were abuses is no reason whatever for virtually withdrawing the scheme, particularly from the one sector of the economy that can impact on the awful job situation here.  For areas along the western and southern seaboard the only potential of any consequence to solve our unemployment and emigration problems is in the tourist area.  By withdrawing this development vehicle virtually entirely from tourism the Minister is ending all hope of the young men and women in west Cork and along the seaboard having any chance of securing employment in their own areas.  The Minister is using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.  He is going the wrong way about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were many ways in which the abuses could have been tackled.  Looking at the procedures in relation to tourism <Col N="1211" /> and industrial projects under the business expansion scheme, I question some of the alleged independent assessments and whether they were the right kind of project to fit in with Government policies.  I would see nothing wrong with the establishment of an independent review body which would look at schemes to ensure that they were in accord with the spirit and letter of the requirements.  In the budget the Minister, effectively, has done away with the scheme.  As it stands it is a Mickey Mouse scheme with two cappings, one in relation to personal investment and the £500,000 capping on the overall scheme.  I also ask the Government to bear in mind the impact this will have on the building industry.  Most of the houses built in west Cork in the last number of years were built under the BES scheme and the builders will be the first to suffer as they will have to lay off their workers.  There are various tax efficient concessions in relation to income tax.  For example, there was tax relief on 15 per cent of a person's income put into a pension fund although it did not do much for the economy.  I know it is a separate issue but it can be compared to a person who is prepared to invest money in a business expansion scheme where something real, tangible and concrete could be done for the economy.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to rethink their position in this regard.  The Taoiseach is present, he knows the southern area as he called into us voluntarily &mdash; and indeed involuntarily on one occasion &mdash; in west Cork.  Maybe it is a slight overstatement to say that tourism is our only hope but it is certainly one of our major hopes in regard to progress in job creation.  By taking tourism out of the scheme, that hope is gone.  My suggestion, of reviving the scheme and having an independent review body to assess each application to ensure that abuses are eliminated would be a far more sensible approach and, from the point of view of the development of the economy, would be the best approach.  Above all, from the point of view of developing our peripheral <Col N="1212" /> areas, which are so dependent on tourism, it is the only path forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this scheme took some time to take off is a reflection on the financial institutions. Someone trying to start a business or expanding it finds it extremely difficult to get money from the banks unless he or she can produce personal guarantees and so on.  The last thing this country needs is to prevent people from investing money. This scheme provided an opportunity for investment.  We should remember that many of these investors were PAYE earners who were already being taxed at a high rate and paying a substantial percentage of their income in taxes.  What is wrong with investing in the future?  Why impose these Mickey Mouse restrictions? As Deputy McCreevy rightly said, if you want to get rid of this scheme say so and introduce a new one.  Letting it die a slow death by providing a limited amount of £500,000 is not the answer.  As Deputy McCreevy also said, we all know people who invested £5,000 or £6,000 or even less in schemes of this kind.  It is not a rich man's club, it was an opportunity to create an environment for people to invest their money in expansion in various areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an opportunity to expand tourism.  The Minister for the Environment is present and, on many occasions, he has spoken to farmers and rural communities of the need to protect the environment so that we can attract tourism.  The tourist who comes here is not looking for the sun or a cheap package holiday.  Tourists come here to rural areas for fishing and other specialist or family holidays.  Many of our hotels do not have modern, up-to-date facilities and the business expansion scheme was one way of ensuring that there would be proper investment in hotels to attract the kind of tourist we want, who will spend money.  Many of our own citizens want to spend their family holiday here.  In spite of this the Minister has now knocked the successful business expansion scheme on the head.  Of course there were abuses but that is the problem of those who <Col N="1213" /> examine each proposal.  It is the responsibility of the authorities who were charged with the responsibility of examining each application.  The ground rules were laid down and officials were paid to decide whether an application qualified in accordance with the general principles of the scheme.  What is wrong in getting the ordinary taxpayer to invest money in a small hotel in a rural area to provide 20 or 30 extra bedrooms or to provide tennis courts and other facilities for children? What is wrong with getting the ordinary taxpayer to invest money in holiday homes?  Nothing.  If there are abuses the loopholes should be closed.  I genuinely appeal to the Taosieach not to wreck this scheme, it is a retrograde step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the proposal to abolish the hotel and guesthouse business expansion scheme has been introduced because it is a backward step in so far as the tourism industry is concerned.  Will the Taoiseach say where the Government's plan for 1988-92 stands by the abolition of this scheme? The Minister pointed out today that it cost the State £40 million when there was in income of £485 million in taxes earned by the tourism industry, partly as a result of this scheme.  I hope that there will be a review and that hotels and guesthouses will be considered in the Finance Bill later.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Developments are going ahead in Killarney, Ballybunion, Kilrush, Kilkee, Lahinch and Salthill and if share certificates have not been issued all these schemes will collapse, resulting in a major disaster.  We were hoping to develop tourism in the west but that will not now happen.  In an area of very high unemployment and emigration there was a potential for tourism but that will be <Col N="1214" /> wiped out if the Government go ahead with this action.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to review the matter.</P>

      <P>I want at the outset to deal with two serious misunderstandings which exist particularly on the Fine Gael front benches.  Let me begin with Deputy Barry who said that there is no cost involved here because if these schemes did not go ahead revenue would not arise. That applies in respect of some things.  If an industry comes in here and gets the 10 per cent tax benefit it would be true to say that there would be no real loss to the Exchequer by the 10 per cent concession because the industry would not have been here otherwise, but that is not the case here.  This is real tax foregone.  This is real income which people have and because of this scheme they do not have to pay tax on it that they would otherwise pay to the Exchequer.  Therefore, there is a real loss to the Exchequer of tax foregone.</P>

The next point I want to make is that the vast majority of the arguments made over there have been made on the basis that tourism is out. Tourism is not out.  There are three things out in the tourism industry &mdash; hotels, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation &mdash; but all the following are in &mdash; boat cruises on the Shannon and so on, horse drawn caravan hire, equestrian centre services, sailing &mdash; yachting marinas, sub-aqua centres &mdash; heritage houses, sea angling boat hire, game fisheries angling services, interpretive centre services, chauffeur driven operations for tourism only, international conference centre services, resort companies wholly or mainly for the provision of approved services, outdoor pursuits, activity centre services, tourist guide agencies and tour coach services.</P>

      <P>I also want to refer to the cap of £500,000 which will not be as serious as Deputies think.  Only 35 of the 239 companies involved went for more than £500,000.  The vast majority of the companies which have benefited so far will still be included in the £500,000 cap.</P>

We want this scheme to continue because it is a very <Col N="1216" /> valuable scheme.  I do not disagree with anyone in this House who says that it has been a very useful scheme but what we want to do is to go back and refocus on the original purposes, which were primarily to get risk capital into small ventures which would provide employment and contribute generally to economic development.</P>

      <P>That was the original purpose of the scheme but what happened, as has been pointed out by Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Rabbitte, was that the accountants got going on it.  They did not abuse the scheme because what they were doing was still within the law. It is no good suggesting that if we put in some sort of supervisory body and not change the law that all would be well. These people were within the law, so we have to change the law if we want to stop the things which are not in accordance with what was originally intended.</P>
      <P>This year this scheme will cost the Exchequer £15 million in income tax foregone which is a lot of money.  There is a lot one could do in relation to the creation of employment with £15 million if one did it directly.  We have to stop misdirections in the scheme and try to get the scheme back and focus it on the sort of thing it was originally intended for because, as some Deputies have rightly pointed out, when the accountants got going on it they made sure there would be no risk at all involved.  I think everybody in the House would agree that there should be risk capital, not just guaranteed investments.  That is one of the considerations involved here.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies keep interrupting me, I am losing my train of thought.  All the discussion here this evening on the exclusion of the tourism industry is not correct.  There is a limited exclusion of the tourism industry only and it was in those areas that a very <Col N="1217" /> limited number of identifiable people were using the scheme over and over again, going from big schemes which resulted in major losses to the Exchequer.  That is the situation we have to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that I have listened to what has been said and would agree with those who say they want the scheme to continue.  We will consider what has been said to see if there are any differences or modifications which can be included to ensure that it will do what we want it to do, which is to have the scheme continue to provide employment and <Col N="1218" /> economic development particularly in the regions that some Deputies have been talking about where tourism is the mainstay. We want to make sure that the original concept and purposes of the scheme &mdash; namely, to provide for small industries which have the possibility of viability, which can provide employment and which need risk capital &mdash; will be preserved.</P>

Tests carried out by the NEB indicated that no danger existed for employees or the environment.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel have purchased equipment to measure the radioactive content of dust samples and have been trained in its use by NEB staff.  Irish Steel have also acquired a radiation detector which is designed to detect any radioactive sources in incoming consignments of scrap steel.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="872" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>As I have previously told the Deputy I do not intend to revoke or withdraw any prospecting licences in this area.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Bord Pleanála decision has categorised this area as being primarily a tourist development area. Each individual planning application is considered on its own merits having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.  I believe that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the recent Bord Pleanála decision referred to by the Deputy at this stage.</P>
      <P>My position regarding a possible future mine development in the Westport and Delphi/Doolough area is the same as it would be for any area of the country.  If minerals can be extracted for the benefit of the Irish economy in an environmentally acceptable way then I will support and encourage such extraction. However, if in my opinion there is an unacceptable risk to the environment I can assure the Deputy that mining will not go ahead.  In this context the Deputy will recall my reply of 20 July 1989, in which I indicated to him that in future no mining licence would be granted by me unless a full and detailed environmental impact assessment had been carried out by an independent expert acceptable to my Department.  These studies will ensure that the most rigorous environmental standards will be met by any proposed new mining activities.  These arrangements will be complementary to the normal existing procedures and requirements of the local planning authorities.</P>

      <P>The proposal for a European Energy Charter <Col N="873" /> arises from an initiative taken by the Netherlands Prime Minister, Mr. Lubbers, submitted to the Dublin Summit in June last year; my initial reaction was one of welcome and support.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach also made known his support for this initiative at meetings of Heads of State in Paris and in Rome over the past months.</P>
      <P>The benefits likely to accrue to the European Community and to Europe as a whole would be increased energy supplies, particularly gas, for users on the one hand, and expanded markets for producers and sellers on the other.  Included in the latter would be the Soviet Union with its enormous resources of both oil and gas.  The advantages arising to the European Community would be considerable in regard to security of supply as well as the economic benefits generally. These benefits should also accrue to Ireland.</P>
      <P>In regard to the current status of the proposal, the position is that the European Commission is preparing an outline approach for discussion both within the Community itself and with other European countries.  I expect the matter to take the form of a proposal from the Commission within the next few months. We will then have an opportunity to formulate Ireland's detailed position on it.</P>

      <P>It is my Department's policy to continuously monitor developments in renewable energy both at home and abroad with a view to introducing them into the energy supply system where technical and reliability criteria can be met and where it is economic to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the hydro potential in the country has already been developed.  The ESB currently has about 512 MW (including 292 MW of pumped storage) <Col N="874" /> of installed hydro electric capacity and there is about another 4 MW of private hydro capacity.  This represents about 73 per cent of the total technically feasible hydro potential in the country.  The best sites, from the technical viewpoint, have already been developed and development of the remainder will undoubtedly be more difficult and costly and will depend on changing economic conditions and other issues such as concern for the environment.</P>
    <P>Attempts in the early 1980's to assess the technical feasibility of developing wind energy in Ireland were, generally speaking, disappointing.  Under the EC Valoren programme, my Department commissioned a survey to identify the most suitable sites for wind energy development and, as the Deputy may be aware, I invited proposals to be submitted to me last year for Ireland's first wind farm development.  The proposals which were submitted in response to this invitation are currently being examined by an assessment team in my Department and I expect to have their recommendation around the middle of February. Up to £3.9 million in EC funds are available for this project under the Valoren programme.</P>
    <P>Most of the remaining opportunities for alternative energy development are not at such a technologically advanced stage as to justify their development on a large commercial scale.  However, research continues to be carried out by the private sector and by State sector companies under EC programmes.  My Department monitor this activity and research which is carried out internationally in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 83 together.  Based on consumption during 1990, and expressed in number of days' supply, the situation regarding national oil stocks as at 28 January 1991 is as follows: petrol, 105 days; home heating/diesel, 88 days; heavy fuel oil, 296 days.</P>
      <P>Our international oil stock holding obligations derive from our membership of the EC and IEA.  The requirements of these bodies are somewhat different with the EC requiring the holding of the equivalent of 90 days' stocks of each product category.  The IEA also require the maintenance of 90 days' but their method of calculation is based on the crude oil equivalent of the previous year's imports rather than on the consumption of individual product categories.  The IEA have, on their particular basis of calculation, most recently reckoned Ireland's stocks position to be 120 days in aggregate.</P>
      <P>The EC requirement to hold 90 days' stock applies to each member state.  As part of Ireland's arrangements to meet this requirement, oil companies are obliged to hold 80 days' stock.  In addition, large consumers of oil are required to hold 55 days' stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general these obligations are met. There have however been certain difficulties on the part of some small indigenous companies on the periphery of the domestic oil supply scene in meeting their obligations.  These problems in some instances date back many years. While it will remain the policy of my Department to secure full compliance with stock holding obligations by all concerned, the nature of these companies <Col N="876" /> and the extent of their operations are such that they have only a marginal effect on the overall stock picture.</P>
    <P>My stated position that national stocks had been increased to 120 days is in accord with an IEA internal document which stated that at the beginning of October 1990 Ireland had stocks of 1.3 million tonnes equivalent to 120 days of net imports.  The position on 28 January is that stocks of 1.2 million tonnes were held, equivalent to 118 days.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House, as I have assured the public on a number of occasions recently, that Ireland's stocks position is more secure now than at any time for many years.  In September last I arranged with INPC that they put over 200,000 tonnes of crude oil into storage at the Whiddy Island terminal.  This is equivalent to 20 days' stocks and has played a significant part in strengthening our overall stocks position.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would again remind Deputies that we are not faced with any immediate threat to our oil supplies.  Should any such threat emerge the Government are well placed to ensure that a wide range of demand restraint measures can be put into effect very quickly.  Since the stock figures which I have mentioned earlier are based on normal levels of consumption, demand restraint measures will ensure that our stocks would in practice last for longer than the indicated number of days at reduced levels of consumption.</P>
    <P>It is a reasonable assumption, given that Ireland's supply sources come from the UK and North Sea, that at worst a very considerable part of normal supplies would continue to arrive here.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 69, 79 and 80 together.  The oil storage terminal at Whiddy Island consists of 12 crude oil storage tanks with a capacity of <Col N="878" /> 958,000 tonnes, and seven other tanks with a capacity of 170,000 tonnes.</P>
      <P>Following the stand-off in the Gulf, the terminal was reactivated and 205,000 tonnes of crude were put into storage in three of the tanks.  This comprises approximately 22 per cent of crude oil storage at the terminal.  Subsequently, two further tanks were prepared and can be bought into immediate use should the need arise.  However, with the existing oil market well supplied no additional storage is considered necessary at present.</P>
      <P>Total storage capacity at the Whitegate refinery is 350,000 tonnes.  The amount held varies from day to day and week to week for operational reasons.  Yesterday evening, for example, the refinery had 196,000 tonnes of oil in total, approximately 56 per cent of capacity.  In a situation where no additional supplies were available to the refinery it could operate until all of its crude stocks were refined. Normal operating practice, of course, is to have stock replaced well in advance of it being required.</P>

      <P>My Department have already taken steps to achieve the forestry objectives set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>The expansion of national planting levels is being actively promoted and achievement of the 30,000 hectare level per year from 1993 is well on target.  Last year over 19,500 hectares were planted and I expect a substantial increase on that level this year.</P>
      <P>Harvesting and marketing programmes are being continually expanded.  Total timber production last year reached 1.5 million cubic metres and is expected to exceed 1.75 million cubic metres this year, which is well on target for achievement of the 2 million cubic metre level by 1993.  This expansion in timber production, as well as the expanded planting levels, will ensure that the job creation targets given in the programme will be achieved.</P>
      <P>New incentives are now in place to help achieve the important objective of expanding the contribution of farmers to the planting programme.  Farmers qualify for the highest grant levels available under the forestry operational programme launched in August 1990.  In addition to these grants, farmers have available to them annual forest premium payments for up to 20 years after afforesting their land.  Arrangements are being made to establish forestry training and promotional programmes for farmers to further expand their involvement in forestry.</P>
      <P>With a view to formulating a strategy for the development of the timber industry to the year 2000, arrangements are being made to undertake a major study of the sector.</P>
      <P>Of the 500 kms of forest roads targeted for construction over the period 1990 to 1993, a total of 141 kms were completed in 1990 and a further 120 kms are proposed for completion this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department are placing increased emphasis on the environmental aspects of forestry and have instituted strict <Col N="880" /> procedures under the forestry operational programme to protect the environment. Steps have been taken to promote the increased planting of broad-leaved trees.  These have included a 50 per cent increase in the grants for broad-leaves. Guidelines have been prepared to limit the adverse impacts of forestry practice on fisheries.  Further guidelines relating to the impacts of forestry practice on (i) archaeology and (ii) amenity and landscape are being prepared.</P>
    <P>New incentives which I announced recently under the rural development operational programme provide for the encouragement of planned recreational forestry geared towards attracting tourism, improving the environment and expanding wood production in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Publicity campaigns are proposed to encourage further investment in forestry by all sectors.</P>
    <P>All steps taken or proposed will be kept under constant review to ensure that all the forestry objectives set in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are fully achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The Government share the concern of Deputies on all sides of the House at the continuing deterioration of conditions in Cambodia.  The infant mortality rate, which is estimated at between 12 per cent and 20 per cent is extremely high and Cambodia is among the countries which have made the least progress in reducing infant mortality in recent years.  This is largely due to the lack of adequate medical and other basic facilities, combined with the grave social and economic difficulties caused by the continuing hostilities in that country.</P>
      <P>I have placed on record on many occasions in this House the Government's support for humanitarian assistance for Cambodia.  Both the UN and the EC continue to provide humanitarian aid to the Cambodian people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1990 Ireland provided <Col N="887" /> £25,000 to OXFAM for purchase of shelter kits for use by people displaced by fighting within Cambodia.  In November 1989 £50,000 was given to CONCERN for emergency aid supplies.</P>
    <P>The latest figures supplied by the Commission on Community aid show that in 1990, 8.82 MECU was given in humanitarian aid for refugees on the Thai-Cambodian border.  In addition 2.67 MECU was provided to non-governmental organisations for emergency relief within the country.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF and the World Food Programme of the United Nations are in the process of opening liaison offices in Phnom Penh.  In addition the Secretary General has established a trust fund to finance the start-up costs of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. The Government have contributed £100,000 to this fund.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of Cambodia's need for long-term development assistance. This need must be addressed in the context of an overall political settlement in that country.  A major obstacle to such aid from either UN or EC sources continues to be that the administration in Phnom Penh, which was installed by the Vietnamese, is not recognised by the international community.</P>
    <P>The European Community has indicated its willingness, on the achievement of a political settlement, to contribute to the reconstruction and development of Cambodia.  It remains my hope that all parties in Cambodia will demonstrate a willingness to honour the commitments they have made to date in the negotiating process now under way and to co-operate with the sustained international effort to secure such a settlement.</P>
    <P>In relation to Khmer Rouge, I refer the Deputies to my replies to questions on 31 October 1990 and 6 December 1990, setting out our overall approach to the Cambodian issue in which I made quite clear the Government's concern to ensure that there is not return to power of the murderous Pol Pot Khmer Rouge.</P>

      <P>The Government are committed to the protection and preservation of the natural environment in this country and throughout the world.  Our approach is to build on and press for development of the work already under way at EC level and in other international fora.  As I stated in my reply to the House on 20 July 1989, I consider that an attempt by Ireland to take a specific initiative itself on a matter of this nature could lead to duplication of effort and inter-organisational conflicts.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the subject of tropical forests was discussed at the European Council in Dublin last June and that a Declaration on the Environment was adopted on that occasion on the initiative of the Irish Presidency.  The issue was also discussed at the EC Development Council on 5 November 1990 when the importance of ensuring the effectiveness of the Tropical Forest Action Plan was agreed.  Furthermore the EC Commission, together with the FAO and the World Bank, is presently working on a co-operation programme with Brazil which should afford valuable assistance to that country in the management of its tropical rainforests.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102, 103 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>I have been aware of the case of this citizen since October 1989 when he wrote to me about his case.  At my direction, an officer of the Embassy immediately paid him a consular visit.  The Embassy also contacted the citizen's legal representative and, in conjunction with the latter, raised his case with the British Police Complaints Authoritry and the British Home Office.  In addition, the Embassy have written on several occasions to the citizen concerned.  Late last year an Embassy official again visited him.</P>
      <P>The Embassy understand that early last year the Police Complaints Authority sent a report on the case to the Home Office.  In the course of this report the question of disciplinary charges being brought against certain police officers was raised.  In addition, the Embassy have been informed by the citizen's legal representative that he made a submission to the Home Office last summer in which he presented fresh evidence and sought a decision from the Home Office for a referral of the case to the Court of Appeal.</P>
      <P>The Home Office indicated to the Embassy earlier this month that this request was under active consideration. Pending a decision on this issue, however, they are not in a position to pursue the question of possible disciplinary charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that the Embassy will continue to stay in close <Col N="890" /> touch with the citizen in question, and his legal representative, and make whatever representations appear necessary in order to promote an early decision in his case.</P>
    <P>I wish to confirm that I have received several representations on behalf of this citizen.  Replies have been, or are in the course of being, issued to all those who have written to me about this case.</P>

      <P>Fergal Caraher was shot dead and his brother Michael seriously wounded by members of a British army patrol in Cullyhanna on 30 December. The circumstances surrounding this incident are deeply disquieting and I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere condolences to the Caraher family on the death of their son.</P>
      <P>This incident was raised immediately in the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast and a full report sought from the British authorities.  In seeking this report, we drew the attention of the British authorities to the serious discrepancies between the British army's version of the circumstances surrounding the shooting and that of local eyewitnesses.  Among the other aspects of this incident of particular concern to us is the decision by the British military authorities to return the soldiers involved to active duty within days of the incident.</P>
      <P>It is now imperative that this incident be comprehensively investigated and the outcome of this investigation made available publicly at the earliest possible date. I will be making this point strongly at the forthcoming meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference, as well as raising other aspects of the incident which are causing widespread concern.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the countries to which the increased overseas aid, referred to by him in his estimates speech on 18 December 1990, is going; and the projects which will be aided in each country.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are increases in aid allocations in 1991 over 1990 in a wide range of areas, both in multilateral and bilateral aid.</P>
      <P>In relation to multilateral aid, it is not possible to identify the countries specifically as the contributions made by Ireland are to general budgets and not to country specific funds.</P>
      <P>However, it may be noted that the increase in multilateral aid contributions arises mainly because of: major increases in EC and International Development Association expenditures due to the provision of special aid to the Gulf frontline states of Egypt, Turkey and Jordan; the increased provision for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states under the new Lomé IV convention; and the new International Development Association Agreement (IDA IX), under which additional subsidised credits will be provided to the poorest developing countries.  We have also provided increased funding for UNICEF and for the Food Aid Convention. How these funds will be used will depend on the requirements facing these organisations.</P>
      <P>Under bilateral aid, the major increase is due to the provision of £3.5 million for countries most affected by the Gulf crisis of which £3 million is for Egypt, the poorest in <i>per capita</i> terms of the three frontline states and £0.5 million for other developing countries, particularly Ireland's priority countries of Zambia, Tanzania and Lesotho and Sudan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beyond this, it is not possible to relate the funding increases in bilateral aid to projects in particular countries.  The pattern of expenditure changes annually and the funding for existing projects rises or <Col N="892" /> falls according to the stage of development of each project.  The distribution by individual project and country of funding for schemes such as the co-financing scheme for non-governmental organisations depends on the applications which may be received during the year.</P>

      <P>The Government decision of 5 April 1990 approved the extension of the decentralisation programme to five new centres, including Wexford.  The question of providing new accommodation for local staff, in conjunction with the provision of decentralised offices, will be considered when the Department and number of staff to be decentralised to Wexford are known.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that post office savings certificates have a lower net yield to standard rate taxpayers than investment in deposit accounts in building societies; if he plans to have a new issue of savings certificates with an enhanced yield; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The return on savings certificates compares quite favourably with the rates available on ordinary deposit/share accounts of building societies generally when tax at the standard rate is deducted from the latter.  Certain building society accounts offer money market related rates or premia on their ordinary deposit/share account rates and some of these offer to standard rate taxpayers net yields that are somewhat greater than that available from savings <Col N="898" /> certificates.  In such cases, however, comparison with savings certificates is made difficult because of differences in conditions, most notably, notices of withdrawal and minimum size of investment.</P>
      <P>While the question of a new issue of savings certificates is kept under review by the National Treasury Management Agency, the Deputy will appreciate that, since savings certificates are competing with other savings products, it is not appropriate for me to speculate on any plans for a new issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Civil Service Commission can only provide figures throughout the period in question for the numbers considered for appointment from open executive officer competitions.  These figures would give a very misleading impression of the impact of open appointments on the executive officer grade for the following reasons: a substantial <Col N="913" /> number of those considered for appointment did not take up offers of appointment &mdash; the available figures suggest a take-up rate of about 60 per cent; a significant number of appointments were made to replace other appointees who left the service within 12 months; posts in a number of departmental grades, such as social welfare officer, higher tax officer, higher officer of customs and excise and junior clerk in the offices of the supreme and high courts, were also filled from open executive officer competitions and the available statistics do not distinguish between appointments to the various grades.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind these factors, the best estimate for the number who took up appointments to executive officer and the equivalent departmental grades and who remained in the service for more than 12 months in the period in question is approximately 800.</P>

      <P>Savings certificates are a medium term investment offering a tax free return of 40 per cent after five years, equivalent to 7 per cent compound interest.  Savings certificates are not therefore deposit accounts, nor are they intended to be used as deposit accounts. A deposit account option already exists in post offices through the Post Office savings bank deposit account.</P>
      <P>The requirement that the names of both the joint holders appear on withdrawal applications for savings certificates is a standard legal provision which has existed as a statutory regulation since 1926 and which, in the case of medium term investments such as savings certificates, is considered essential.</P>

      <P>The revised design is now being finalised following consultations with Drogheda Corporation, the Department of Justice and the Garda.  Detailed design is proceeding in order to advance the project to tender stage with a view to placing a contract as soon as possible.</P>

I believe that fishermen in the Irish Sea are entitled to the highest safety standard being applied by all.  The Government are very seriously concerned about the dangers that submarines pose to shipping and about the nuclear hazard in the event of an incident involving nuclear powered or armed submarines. We avail of every opportunity in international fora, such as the United Nations and the International Maritime Organisation, to focus attention on the problem.  My Department are at present pursuing this matter in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs, and will continue to do so in the coming months.  The matter is also being pursued with relevant fishery authorities, particularly in the UK.  The Department of Foreign affairs have raised specific incidents with the authorities of the countries concerned and will continue to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for fixing the level of the ewe premium lies with the EC Commission.  Under the premium <Col N="929" /> regulations for the sheepmeat sector, advances of the ewe premium may be paid in two half-yearly instalments representing 30 per cent each of the expected premium for the year.  The amount of the final premium must be fixed not later than 31 March of the following year.</P>
      <P>Because of changes in the ewe premium arrangements in 1990, payments in Ireland were made in respect of applications for the 1989 and the 1990 premiums together.  The levels of premiums were: 1989 (full premium) £17.75 per ewe; 1990 &mdash; first advance fixed in June 1990 &mdash; £6.53 per ewe; and 1990 &mdash; second advance fixed in September 1990 &mdash; £7.22 per ewe.</P>
      <P>The total value of ewe premium payments made to Irish sheep producers last year amounted to £139 million.  In addition, headage payments totalling £16 million were paid to producers in severely handicapped areas.  These income support measures were of considerable assistance in the face of the difficult market conditions pertaining during the year.</P>
      <P>In order to determine the rate of the 1990 premium, the Commission must have available the ewe census figures from each member state to calculate the level of the stabiliser for Great Britain and the rest of the Community.  I understand that the Commission will have received the appropriate data from each member state by early March 1991 and that it will take a decision shortly afterwards on the level of the 1990 premium. Following publication in the Official Journal, the payment of the balance of the 1990 premium will be authorised.  The payment in Ireland will be made as soon as the procedures outlined above have been completed.</P>

      <P>I did not make any specific statement encouraging farmers to rear rabbits.  The operational programme for rural development which I announced on 20 December last provides for grant aid towards the cost of providing facilities for the commmercial production of rabbits and other alternative enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of aid is fixed at 50 per cent <Col N="942" /> in less favoured areas and 40 per cent elsewhere for housing and cages &mdash; aid is subject to an investment ceiling of £5,000.</P>
    <P>As the return on rabbit production depends on a number of variables such as size and type of enterprise, level of investment, labour costs and particularly market outlets, it would not be meaningful to reply to the question as framed. An applicant under the grant scheme will be required to furnish certification by Teagasc that the applicant has the necessary expertise and resources to undertake the project, that the project is proceeding having due regard to the market situation and that an appropriate market plan has been prepared.  Details of the scheme will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>While I do not have official information on prices since the ceasing of price control generally, I have had officials in my Department selectively monitor a number of energy products, including liquefied petroleum gas, since the commencement of the Gulf crisis.  My Department have been in contact with the gas companies concerned and advised them that both I and the Government would view with great concern any upward movements in consumer prices which could not be fully justified both as to timing and content.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information obtained, recent increases in the retail price of bottled gas would not appear to be excessive, bearing in mind the fact that the international supply price for this product, as independently reported, has increased by a factor of three since July of last year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's assertion that there is little competition in the market for bottled gas, I would point out that there are three companies servicing the needs of the Irish market.  Moreover, other forms of energy supply, such as natural gas and electricity, provide direct competition in the market.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Government are fully committed to improving competition and the Oireachtas will shortly be asked to consider a new comprehensive competition Bill.</P>

      <P>In addition, in 1990 a total of £13,800 was paid to the Government Supplies Agency in respect of printing of the Department's annual report, the Department's labour inspection report, the guide to the redundancy payments scheme and a document entitled, &ldquo;Case Studies in Worker Participation&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>A number of paragraphs in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which the Government are committed to implement following adoption by interested parties, contain proposals on assisting women to improve their position in the workforce.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 92 of section IV of the programme sets out the Government's commitment to the attainment of a society based on principles of equality and equal opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 99 of section IV recognises that, arising out of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> FÁS have expanded <Col N="956" /> the opportunities for women to take up careers in non-traditional areas.  This was achieved through the FÁS positive action programme which has as its overall objective to increase and broaden the range of job opportunities available to women in the labour market.  Specific objectives include positive action to break down traditional patterns of occupational segregation by encouraging increased female participation in sectors of the labour market traditionally dominated by men.  FÁS encourage women who wish to return to work after a period of absence from the workforce to undertake &ldquo;return to work&rdquo; courses.  There is no regulation currently in force which excludes women from such courses.  In 1989, 652 women completed &ldquo;return to work&rdquo; courses.  The FÁS positive action programme in 1990 increased this figure to a target of 960 women.</P>
    <P>During 1991 FÁS will continue to provide the positive action programme and 1991 targets are now being set by FÁS. Under the programme targets are also set in relation to female participation in apprenticeship, building on experience courses and employment schemes.  There is also continuing liaison between FÁS and the Employment Equality Agency on the question of equality for women in relation to FÁS activities.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 124 of section V of the proposed <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides that the live register requirements in the case of women applicants should be relaxed to facilitate women who wish to return to the workforce.  I am considering how progress can be made in this area.</P>

      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann have drawn up a register of non-gas estates in the Dublin area.  The register comprises some 350 estates with 100,000 dwellings.  Bord Gáis Éireann are developing a programme for the connection of these non-gas estates. When this is available BGE will be in a position to indicate the timescale involved for connection.  While BGE will connect estates as quickly as possible the scale of the project means that it will extend over a number of years.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann must earn a satisfactory return on their capital expenditure. All estates will accordingly be surveyed to ascertain the level of take-up of gas and only those where a sufficient number of people opt for a supply, and on which the board can secure an adequate return on their investment, will be connected.  During the survey residents will be advised of the charges involved in securing a supply and the cost of changng their existing system to gas.</P>

      <P>The International Energy Agency (IEA) are an autonomous body established in November 1974 within the framework of the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to implement an international energy programme.</P>
      <P>They carry out a comprehensive programme of energy co-operation among 21 of the OECD's 24 member countries. The basic aims of IEA are: (i) to promote co-operation among IEA participating countries to reduce excessive dependence on oil through energy conservation, development of alternative energy souces and energy research and development; (ii) to operate an information system on the international oil market as well as consultation with oil companies; (iii) to promote co-operation with oil producing and other oil consuming countries with a view to developing a stable international energy trade as well as the rational management and use of world energy resources in the interest of all countries; (iv) to develop a plan to prepare participating countries against the risk of a major disruption of oil supplies and to share available oil in the event of an emergency.</P>
      <P>The main obligation which derives from IEA membership is the maintenance of oil stocks.  Ireland's record in this regard is not an issue and the most recent survey by the IEA calculated that Ireland held 120 days of oil stocks, significantly in excess of the agency's required level of 90 days.</P>

    <P>In terms of ensuring control of supply and distribution so that vital energy needs can be met in times of supply difficulties <Col N="962" /> the Deputy will be aware that as Minister for Energy I have at my disposal a wide range of statutory powers which I can use for that purpose.  The necessary Statutory Instrument to invoke such powers is maintained on a continuous basis by the Government as a precautionary measure and to facilitate speed of action if that is required.</P>
    <P>As a general comment I would say that Ireland's situation in regard to security of energy supplies has substantially improved over the past decade and is now characterised by greater diversity of energy sources and reduced reliance on oil.</P>

      <P>The person concerned exhausted his entitlements to unemployment benefit and claimed unemployment assistance on 19 September 1990.  His means, derived from capital, a pension and the value of his wife's earnings were assessed at £113.60 per week.</P>
      <P>This assessment left him entitled to payment of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £6.20.</P>
      <P>He has appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office.  The appeal has been delayed due to the need for further investigations, which proved to be protracted, into information put forward by him in support of his appeal.  The papers in his case have now been referred to the social welfare appeals office and a decision will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>It is a statutory condition for the receipt of unemployment assistance that a person must be unemployed on each day for which he or she claims payment of assistance.  Section 135 (5) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1981 provides that a person shall not be deemed to be unemployed on any day on which he or she works for wages or any other remuneration.</P>
      <P>The legislation also provides that an unemployment assistance claimant may work for up to three days in any period of six days and be paid unemployment assistance for the other three days. However, a person who works from Monday to Friday inclusive &mdash; regardless of the number of hours involved &mdash; would not be regarded as unemployed on any of these days and would not be entitled to receive payment of unemployment assistance for any of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The part-time job incentive scheme was introduced to help overcome possible disincentive effects which this system could have in certain cases.  Under this scheme, which operates nationwide, those who are long term unemployed can engage in part-time employment and at the same time be paid an allowance by my Department.  To be eligible for this allowance, a person must have been in receipt of unemployment assistance at <Col N="965" /> the long term rate and be working in insurable employment of not more than 24 hours in any week.  The allowance is payable whether the hours of employment are spread over all of the days of the weeks or compressed into a few days.</P>
    <P>The current rates of payment to people participating in the part-time job incentive scheme are £33 a week for people without dependants and £55 for those with qualified dependants.</P>

    <P>He made a claim for unemployment assistance on 6 December 1990 and, following investigation, a deciding officer <Col N="966" /> assessed his means at £94.40 per week from that date.  The means are derived from the benefit of his wife's earnings.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of disability benefit requires that the claimant must have a total of 39 reckonable contributions paid or credit in the governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 17 January 1990 and was paid 52 weeks' benefit up to 19 January 1991.  To continue entitlement after 52 weeks' payment she would need 39 contributions paid or credited in the 1989-90 contribution year which is the governing year for the period from 20 January 1991 in her case.  As she had only 11 credited contributions for 1989-90 she did not qualify for continued payment of disability benefit.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has not offered any evidence suggesting that her insurance record is not correct.  It is, of course, open to her to submit any details she may consider relevant and her entitlement to disability benefit will be immediately re-investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A spouse's insurance contributions can only be used for the purpose of widow's pensions and deserted wife's benefit claims.  Such contributions may also <Col N="967" /> confer entitlement to treatment benefit in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>Self-employment contributions (class S) were introduced with effect from 6 April 1988, the date of commencement of the 1988-89 contribution year.  These contributions cover entitlement to widow's contributory pension.</P>
      <P>A widow's contributory pension may be based on either the widow's or her late husband's PRSI record.  The two PRSI records may not be combined to qualify for the pension.  Whichever record is being used must have sufficient PRSI contributions paid at the date of the husband's death to satisfy the following two conditions.</P>
      <P>The first condition is that the insured person must have at least 156 contributions paid &mdash; 156 contributions represents payment for three full contribution years.  A person who commenced paying self-employment contributions from 6 April 1988 would not yet have 156 contributions paid, and accordingly, there would not be title to widow's contributory pension based solely on these contributions.  However, if that person had previously been insurably employed and had contributions paid which cover entitlement to widow's contributory pension, the contributions can be combined with the self-employment contributions when examining title to widow's contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The second condition is that the insured person must either: (a) have an average of 39 weeks PRSI a year paid or credited over the three or five tax years before the husband died or reached pension age, 66 years at present; or (b) have, for a minimum pension, an average of at least 24 weeks PRSI paid or credited per year in the period between starting work and the end of the tax year before the husband died or reached pension age.</P>

      <P>Recruitment to the Prison Service is by way of open competition conducted by <Col N="978" /> the Civil Service Commissioners.  A competition was advertised by the Civil Service Commissioners in July 1990 and qualifying written tests were conducted during October 1990.  Candidates attaining a sufficiently high placing at these written tests will be called to competitive interview and a panel will be established from which successful candidates may be offered appointment.  I am informed by the Civil Service Commissioners that it is not their policy to supply specific information in relation to competitions while they are in progress.</P>
      <P>While provision has been made in the 1991 Estimates for a net increase in Prison Service staff levels of 196 prison officers, the precise number to be appointed will ultimately depend on a number of factors including the number of retirements, resignations, etc.  Forty seven prison officers have been appointed so far this year from an existing panel of qualified persons established by the Civil Service Commissioners.  Additional appointments will be made, on a phased basis, throughout the year, some from the existing panel and the remainder from the new panel.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service Commissioners will shortly be advertising further competitions for the posts of Prison Officer (Trades), Industrial Training Instructor II and Clerk of Works (Mechanical).  It is hoped that appointments from these competitions will be made in the summer.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 308 and 317 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that, in regard to road grants, the Deputy is referring to the discretionary grants to county councils which supplement the provisions made by these authorities from their own resources for works on regional, main, and county roads.</P>
      <P>Because of my concern about the condition of regional and county roads, I have made substantial increases in the levels of discretionary grant funding for them since 1987.  The 1990 discretionary road grant allocations notified for these roads to county councils amounted to £63.13 million, compared with £47.4 million in 1989 and £23.4 million in 1986. I am satisfied that the road grant contribution to overall expenditure on regional and county roads is reasonable. The extent to which local authority resources are used for road works is a matter for determination by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>The rate support grant paid to local authorities replaces in part the income from rates formerly applicable to domestic dwellings and agricultural land.  This income varies from local authority to local authority, because of differences in valuation levels and in rate poundages applied by councils over the years.  These variations together with variations arising from other changes in local finances in recent years, including the abolition of certain levies and the termination of liability for certain local loans fund repayments, are reflected in differences in the rate support grant allocations for individual local authorities.</P>

      <P>As the bridge in question is located on a non-national road, primary responsibility for assessing possible measures to improve safety there, and for implementing such measures, rests with the local authority concerned, in this case Wexford County Council.  The cost involved falls to be financed from local authority resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my Department for works on non-national roads.  In the case of Wexford County Council, these grants totalled £2.119 million in 1990.  The discretionary grants for 1991 will be notified to local authorities early next month.</P>

      <P>Rosslare is only one of four major commercial seaports selected for major investment under the operational programme on peripherality &mdash; the others being Dublin, Waterford and Cork.  In addition, investment in a number of other ports, including Limerick, Galway and Foynes, will be assisted under the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The road investment strategy outlined in the programme is designed as far as possible to improve, as resources permit, the roads providing access to these ports and to selected airports.  Immediate priority is being given to the development of four strategic sections of national primary <Col N="1000" /> roads.  The improvement of the N4, Dublin to Kinnegad and N7, Portlaoise to Dublin, will facilitate access to Dublin Port from the West and Mid-West, while works on the N11 and N25 will improve overall access to Rosslare.  The reasons for the selection of these routes are set out in paragraph 3.12 of the programme. Improvement works on the remaining national primary roads will in the short term concentrate on routes which are deficient on capacity grounds.  In addition, there will be investment in rail freight gantries at Limerick and Sligo which will help improve rail freight access to ports from the West and Mid-West.</P>
    <P>In 1990, £2.5 million was spent on the improvement of the N18, Galway to Limerick, £0.213 million on the N24, Limerick to Waterford and £5.14 million on the N25 to Rosslare.  The amount to be spent on these roads in the remaining years of the programme will be determined in the annual allocation of State grants for national roads.</P>

      <P>The concept of subvented beds will no longer apply with the commencement of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. Rather a statutory duty will be placed on nursing home proprietors to apply for registration to the health board and on the health board to register nursing homes.  The boards will be enabled to subvent a person in need of care in a registered nursing home, following an assessment of the person's dependency and their means and circumstances.</P>

    <P>*Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to make direct comparisons between costs incurred in respect of those patients who are receiving dialysis in their own health board area and those who have to travel for treatment, as such costs will depend on a number of factors such as (a) the number of places available locally at any one time and (b) the nature and complexity of the cases being dealt with.  My Department <Col N="1009" /> are examining the possibility of establishing further satellite units in the context of the resources which will be available for the health services generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 347 and 348 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New arrangements for eligibility for public hospital services were announced in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The relevant extract from the programme is set out in the <Col N="1011" /> addendum below.  The principal changes are the abolition of the income limit for Category 2 eligibility, so that all patients will now be entitled to avail of consulant care as a public patient, and the introduction of restrictions on the access of private patients to public beds.</P>
    <P>The measures were recommended by the Commission on Health Funding and by the National Economic and Social Council, and were then agreed in the context of the discussions between the Government and the social partners on a new programme.  The measures will go to rectify a number of anomalies identified by the commission which arise in determining eligibility for hospital services cards.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements for hospital care have given rise to some misleading comment, and it is important, therefore, to make clear exactly what they involve: everyone, regardless of income, is already entitled to a public bed as a public patient, and this will not change.  The hospital system will provide for the same number of people; at present, any public patient whose income is above £16,700, or who is dependant of a person with such income is liable for the professional fees of each consultant involved in his or her care.  From 1 June next, those who wish to be public patients will no longer be liable for consultants' fees.  This will greatly facilitate the management of hospital services by clearly identifying, for the first time, public and private patients; the availability of public beds for public patients will be increased by changing the present arrangements under which private patients are entitled to avail of public beds.  New arrangements will be phased in under which private patients needing elective, i.e. non-emergency treatment will be required to avail of private or semi-private accommodation; and emergency cases will continue to be accommodated in whatever bed is available.</P>
    <P>These measures will be of significant value to public patients and will not give rise to any reduction in the overall number of public beds.  Public patients <Col N="1012" /> will, when the system has been implemented, face shorter waiting lists than would otherwise have been the case as the access of private non-emergency cases to these beds is gradually phased out.  In addition, public patients who, because of their income, have been liable for consultants' fees although they had no wish to avail of private or semi-private care, will benefit from the removal of this liability.</P>
    <P>In improving the position of public patients, the Government will also ensure that the public hospital system continues to cater adequately for the needs of private patients.  Our public hospitals benefit greatly from having a balanced mix of public and private practice, and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board's schemes have made a major contribution to maintaining this.</P>
    <P>The Government will be careful to ensure that the role of private medicine and of voluntary health insurance is not diminished.  When the change is introduced any increased demand for private beds will not be at the expense of public beds and will be introduced on a self-funding basis only.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to refer to speculation in the past week that the new arrangements might lead to a substantial drop in VHI membership. There is no basis for this view.  The new measures relate only to public beds, whereas virtually all of those joining VHI do so in order to have cover for private and semi-private beds.  The VHI Board have confirmed to me that they have no reason to expect any significant fall in their membership, and this conclusion is also supported by independent research carried out by the ESRI.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures will be effective in improving equity of access to public hospital services.  The new arrangements will be carefully monitored to ensure that this improvement takes place as the changes are implemented.</P>
    <P>The following is the addendum:</P>
    <P>An objective of this programme is to ensure the greatest possible equity in the availability of health services, <Col N="1013" /> particularly in relation to equity of access to public hospital services.  To this end, it has been agreed as part of the programme and having regard to the recommendations of the Commission on Health Funding and of the NESC, that a number of changes to the present eligibility structure are required.</P>
    <P>The income limit for Category 2 eligibility, i.e. entitlement to a hospital services card, will be abolished from 1 June 1991, leading to two categories of eligibility instead of the present three: medical card holders will continue to be entitled to the full range of public health services as at present, and all others will be entitled to the services currently available to those at present in Category 2.</P>
    <P>There will be some modification of the present arrangements for admission to public ward accommodation in public hospitals.  Under the new system, consultants' private patients availing of public hospitals for elective, i.e. non-emergency, treatment will eventually be accommodated only in private or semi-private beds.  This system will be phased in gradually during which period admission arrangements will be kept under review to ensure that they operate in an equitable manner.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to maintaining the position of private practice both within and outside the public hospital system.  The Government also recognise the crucial role played by voluntary health insurance. In gradually implementing the new system the Government will be sensitive to the need to ensure that the public hospital system caters adequately for the requirements of private patients and that the important role and contribution of voluntary health insurance is not diminished in any way.</P>
    <P>The assessment procedures for medical card eligibility must be sufficiently flexible to ensure that no person in genuine need of a medical card suffers hardship through failure to <Col N="1014" /> obtain one.  There is also, however, a need for uniformity and consistency in the procedures so that persons in similar circumstances are assessed similarly in all areas.  The chief executive officers of the health boards will be asked to carry out an early review of the methods of assessment used throughout the country so as to ensure that both these objectives are met.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has already announced that a statutory medical card appeals system is being introduced; also that Regulations are being made to provide that a person who would otherwise be eligible for a medical card cannot lose this entitlement solely as a result of availing of the family income supplement or the social employment scheme. </P>

      <P>The post of caretaker which was shared between St. Joseph's and the Loreto Convent national schools, Navan, fell vacant in November 1986 and was subject to the embargo on the replacement of such staff.  I am not therefore in a position to approve the appointment of a caretaker in this case.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> contains proposals to expand the provision of caretaking services to all national schools of 100 pupils upwards on a phased basis, commencing in 1992.  The position with regard to the schools in question will be considered when the allocations are being made for 1992.</P>

      <P>The loading on school buses is determined by the relevant sections of the Road Traffic Regulations (Construction. Equipment and Use of Vehicles).  A maximum loading is calculated on the basis of three schoolchildren to every two adult seats.  There is no extra allowance for standing passengers.</P>
      <P>The position therefore is that a 45 adult seater bus can carry 67 schoolchildren, a 49 adult seater bus 73 schoolchildren, etc. Bus Éireann, which operates the scheme on behalf of my Department, ensures that the loadings do not exceed the maximum legal carrying capacity of the different bus types in use.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of the school's financial allocation, I am satisfied that the school's requirements, including provision for malicious damages, were adequately provided for by the funds made available to it by my Department in 1990.</P>

      <P>There are three post-primary schools in Portlaoise with a total enrolment of 1,149 pupils.  Major building projects had been mooted for two of the schools &mdash; the CBS and the vocational school.  In accordance with standard practice, discussions were initiated with the school managements on the issue of rationalisation.</P>
      <P>The need for rationalisation has been accepted by the managements of all three post-primary schools in the centre and discussions and consultations among all the interested parties, including parents and teachers, are being conducted at local level.</P>
      <P>I would not wish to anticipate the outcome of these local discussions but I would hope that local consensus and agreement on the future provision of post-primary facilities in Portlaoise will emerge in the near future.</P>

    <P>The pupil-teacher ratio differs from that given in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 186 on 13 November 1990 because the staffing of the school was taken as principal plus ten assistants plus a remedial, a total of 12.  The post of tenth assistant had been approved on the <Col N="1035" /> 28 June 1990 as the school qualified for an additional appointment as a developing school under the terms of Circular 8/90.

This minimum enrolment was not achieved, therefore the staffing of the school remained at principal plus nine assistants plus remedial.</P>
