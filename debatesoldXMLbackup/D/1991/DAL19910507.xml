    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, and Written Question No. 78 together.</P>
      <P>The development of the Temple Bar area has been undertaken by the Government on the basis of unanimous proposals and recommendations made to them by Temple Bar Development Council which represents people from the area itself, in Dublin Corporation's excellent action plan for the area and by representative groups chaired by the two most recent Lord Mayors of Dublin.  The development has the full support of the Arts Council and the council are and will be actively involved in its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the renewal and development of Temple Bar is to build on what has been taking place in the area spontaneously and to create a living, bustling cultural and tourist quarter which people will visit in significant numbers and in which many more will work and live.  The activities and uses will include restaurants, speciality shops, recording studios, a film centre, craft workshops and outlets, theatres, art galleries &mdash; both visual and graphic &mdash; hotels &mdash; especially smaller ones &mdash; and a variety of other retail shops and markets, indoor and outdoor, including antique shops, bookshops and clothing shops, especially Temple Bar's already unique second hand bookshops.  The objective is, also, <Col N="2040" /> to have significant residential accommodation for students and others who wish to live in the Temple Bar area.</P>
    <P>Two companies have been established to deal with the development of the Temple Bar area as a Government flagship project for Dublin's year as European City of Culture in 1991.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Renewal Ltd. are a company limited by guarantee, chaired by the Lord Mayor of Dublin in office.  Up to now, their essential function has been to advise me, and through me the Government, on how the Temple Bar area should be developed.  From now on, their essential function will be to decide which development proposals merit the incentives provided for the Temple Bar area in the Finance Bill, 1991 which is currently before the House.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties Ltd. are a company limited by shares of which the Taoiseach, through his nominees, is the sole shareholder, as the member of the Government with responsibility for culture. Their essential function is to act as a development company for the Temple Bar area on behalf of the Government in accordance with the recommended development plan.</P>
    <P>I am circulating a statement which lists the current boards of directors of Temple Bar Properties Ltd. and of Temple Bar Renewal Ltd. and details of the registration of Temple Bar Properties Ltd. in the Companies Office.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill, 1991 provides for a range of incentives for the development of the area and for the role of Temple Bar Renewal Ltd. in deciding which proposals merit these incentives.</P>
    <P>I will be circulating shortly a Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Bill, 1991 which will establish on a statutory basis Temple Bar Renewal Ltd. as the company to act as provided for in the Finance Bill, and provide that the company shall lay their decisions on the approval of development proposals before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their information; establish on a statutory basis Temple Bar Properties Ltd. as the company to implement the development <Col N="2041" /> of Temple Bar on behalf of the Government; provide that the Minister for Finance may guarantee the borrowings of Temple Bar Properties Ltd.; provide that Temple Bar Renewal and Properties Ltd. will be subject to public service pay guidelines; provide that tenants on less than commercial rents in Temple Bar may not assign or sublet; provide powers of compulsory purchase in the Temple Bar area to Temple Bar Properties Ltd.; and exempt Temple Bar Properties Ltd. from stamp duty in relation to the properties they acquire in the Temple Bar area.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated previously, Temple Bar Properties Ltd. will implement the European Commission pilot project for the Temple Bar area for which the Commission have provided funding of IR£3.6 million representing 50 per cent of the total cost.  Further, the European Investment Bank have agreed to provide a loan of £5 million to Temple Bar Properties Ltd. for the first phase of the development of the area and to consider favourably further loans for later phases of the development.  As I have also indicated to the House previously, Temple Bar Properties Ltd. will be acquiring, on the basis of an independent valuation, all the properties owned in the Temple Bar area by CIE and Dublin Corporation.  The company will also acquire such other key properties in the area as they consider essential to their development role.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties Ltd. will as a commercial State company be treated as is normal for any such company.</P>
    <P>The detailed day to day operations of Temple Bar Properties Ltd. and of Temple Bar Renewal Ltd., including those in relation to staff and the acquisition of properties, are matters for the companies and not matters appropriate for me to answer in this House.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties Ltd. will under the terms of the forthcoming Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Bill, 1991 be required to provide details of their operation to the Minister for Finance, given that he will give a State guarantee for the company's borrowing. The company's accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. <Col N="2042" /> As a commercial State company, Temple Bar Properties Ltd. can be added to the remit of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State Companies.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Renewal Ltd. will, again under the terms of the forthcoming Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Bill, 1991, be required to lay their decisions before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their information.</P>
    <P>I believe the method of implementing this Temple Bar project, involving the people who live and work in Temple Bar in co-operation with local and central Government, represents a unique and highly desirable method of development. I believe it is already proving a highly effective way of proceeding.  I am confident it will serve as a model for other desirable developments in Dublin and throughout the county.  I trust that I have the full support of the House for what is underway in Temple Bar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach why, in relation to this project, he has departed from precedent and made himself the sole shareholder, whereas in the vast majority of cases the shareholder is the Minister for Finance.  As the Taoiseach has said in his considered reply, the Minister for Finance will have a lot of responsibility when the Bills are put before this House.  May I also ask the Taoiseach, as no Bill has been introduced and I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement that Bills will have to come before the House &mdash; how Temple Bar Properties Limited or some other such company have been involved already in property deals, even prior to the company's formation? Perhaps the Taoiseach could tell us when the company were formed, if they have been formed, and how they have been able to conduct property dealings with property owners in the Temple Bar area?  Could the Taoiseach outline to the House, perhaps in round figures, the amount of capital outlays which he envisages Temple Bar Properties Limited making, the amount in direct grants or the amount that will be attributed to taxes foregone to the State in the process of <Col N="2044" /> the development in this area?  Lastly, could the Taoiseach give some indication of the residential content which he expects to see in the Temple Bar area when the development is completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point, we are following the normal practice that the shares in these companies are held in the name of the member of the Government responsible for the particular project.  As it happens I am the principal member of Government responsible for cultural and artistic affairs and therefore the companies have been set up under the aegis of my Department and the shares are vested in me.  I want to assure the Deputy and the public that that is simply a legislative procedure.  The shares are held by the Taoiseach in his capacity as Taoiseach and not by me personally, in case there might be any such suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>You never know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there has been one property transaction which is quite transparent.  It was entered into because the property came on the market and it was important to acquire it.  It was a church property, Saints Michael and John's Church, with surrounding buildings and land.  It is envisaged that expenditure will be in the region of £7.2 million of which £3.6 million, 50 per cent, is coming from the European Commission. There will also be presumably a lot of capital transactions, and the European Investment Bank have very kindly put up £5 million with the promise of putting up more if desired.  I would explain that it is very important that those kinds of capital provisions be made by institutions like the European Investment Bank because many of the activities and premises that we envisage taking part in the Temple Bar area will not necessarily be commercially viable propositions.  Therefore, to a large extent there will have to be an element of subsidisation either in their acquisition or otherwise.  That is why the finance from the European Investment Bank is very important.  Temple Bar <Col N="2045" /> Properties Limited were incorporated on 24 October 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has an economic analysis of the area been carried out in advance? The Taoiseach will recall that in his written reply he talked about how this area was spontaneously redeveloping itself. Could he indicate to the House if an economic analysis was carried out in advance in this area in terms of the effect of these very generous allowances on other areas within the city which might otherwise have hoped to benefit from such an incentive from the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically this redevelopment project will be non-commercial. I think the Deputy is aware of the history of the area.  The underlying reality is that over a period of years CIE acquired a lot of property in this area for the purpose of establishing a central transport depot.</P>
      <P>Pending the establishment of the depot in Temple Bar CIE gave out a number of leases to very desirable small projects, not necessarily at economic rents.  The problem we were faced with was how to deal with the cessation of CIE's interest in the area and at the same time maintain the people in the CIE properties who had set up all sorts of desirable enterprises. What we decided was that the new company, Temple Bar Properties Limited, on behalf of the people in the area and the Government, would take over the premises from CIE at an agreed valuation and the company would then be in a position to continue the tenancies of the various people who had established enterprises there.  That is the economic basis of the whole operation.  Many of the people who are running art galleries, studios, musical venues and so on in the area are not in a position to pay the commercial rents that normal redevelopment would require. That is why Temple Bar Properties Limited, on behalf of the Government are stepping in and becoming a property company who will encourage these people to carry on at rents which they might not otherwise be able to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One supplementary question asked by Deputy Spring which I omitted to answer <Col N="2046" /> was about the residential aspect.  It is hoped that we will be able to provide very considerable accommodation there for a large number of students &mdash; maybe up to 2,000 &mdash; in addition to the normal population.  I could not say that any specific economic analysis was made in the terms that Deputy Quinn has in mind, but a great deal of study and investigation was carried out by the local community development organisation of the possibilities of the area and how they would like to see it developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A significant component of the provisions in the Finance Bill at present before the House is for allowances against existing properties, some of which are 100 years old and more.  Will the decisions that have been taken already but not yet announced cover the area of planning permissions, building regulations and fire standards so as to ensure that there will not be a contradiction between the desire for refurbishment on the one hand and the imposition of 20th century fire standards as currently understood by Dublin Corporation which would require either demolition or major physical transformation of the detrimental kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, we will have to adhere fully to the corporation's planning requirements.  One of the main documents will be the corporation's plan for the area which has been adopted as part of the overall development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have an estimate of the likely tax loss to the Exchequer as a result of the tax concessions being granted towards the redevelopment of this property?  Will the Taoiseach say why it was considered necessary to allow people to write-off against rent from property in some other part of the country the costs of refurbishment of property within the Temple Bar area?  Surely it is not necessary to give them such a generous concession? Furthermore, why do the Revenue Commissioners not decide whether individual properties will qualify for tax relief <Col N="2047" /> instead of Temple Bar Renewal, a company yet to be set up?  Surely it would have been better to follow previous precedents of allowing the Revenue, who have a well established tradition of independence, to make a decision in regard to individual properties?  Does the Taoiseach believe that the extension of these tax reliefs will have changed in any sense the value of property in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point, no, it is not possible, nor is it possible in any of these tax incentive schemes, to estimate what revenue will be foregone. In one way one could say that none will be foregone because, if we were not doing this, nothing would happen there and there would not be any revenue. However, I cannot give the Deputy any estimate at this stage.  The Revenue, of course, will still make the final decision on whether anything complies with the Finance Act incentives; the only thing that Temple Bar Renewal will do is to approve of the sort of developments which can take place there and recommend to Temple Bar Properties Limited whether any particular project or enterprise should be approved for property being made available.  The implementation of the financial tax incentives will, of course, be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners as usual.  What was the Deputy's third point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked why it was necessary to allow relief against property outside the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the normal provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not particularly wedded to it but tax incentives are a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I understand that is the normal provision in this sort of tax incentive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that these incentives are not normal?  In <Col N="2048" /> section 23 cases in general there is a ring fence and one is not allowed to claim against property outside the development the expenses which are being claimed within the development.  It is unusual that a person who has done a property development, say in County Mayo, could set off the costs of the Temple Bar development &mdash; which they are also doing &mdash; against the cost they have incurred in County Mayo.  This is quite an unusual removal in section 50 of this year's Finance Bill of a normal ring fence which applies in cases such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>The issue should not lead to argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should pursue that matter in the Finance Bill, which is still before the House.  By way of background, it is important for Deputies to understand that this is not similar to the normal type of urban renewal proposal. It is not, for instance, in the same category as the Financial Services Centre as the people going in there will be commercial concerns who will seek to make &mdash; and will make &mdash; handsome profits.  In the Temple Bar area we hope to encourage many enterprises which would not, in the normal way, be commercially viable. We hope to give them special incentives and favourable treatment which will enable all sorts of desirable little enterprises to flourish there, which would not be the case if we applied the normal strictly commercial considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring this matter to finality.  I acknowledge that seven questions were involved but we have spent wellnigh 25 minutes on the subject.  I will call Deputy Byrne and, finally, Deputy Spring.</P>

      <P>I wish the project well, everybody will be happy to see it succeed. Will the Taoiseach confirm that CIE are satisfied with the sum of £4 million compensation which was negotiated?  Was it by agreement?  Given that CIE had amassed substantial quantities of land, do they still retain any role or directorship <Col N="2049" /> in any of the companies?  Do they retain a functioning role on any of the boards of the Temple Bar Renewal Company or Temple Bar Properties Limited?  If there is to be subsidisation to small businesses, restaurants, galleries, and so on and if there is exploitation of the workforce &mdash; which has occurred in the Temple Bar area &mdash; will the Taoiseach guarantee that those who exploit workers will not receive any subsidies?</P>

CIE will not have any further role; we have taken the policy decision that this will not be a transport centre and from now on all sorts of different types of activities and considerations will apply.

      <P>Whereas I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach in relation to his ambitions for this area, I am somewhat surprised at the extension of the size of this area from the original Temple Bar area.  It now stretches from Westmoreland Street to Fishamble Street, which is way beyond the original intention and, in effect, will make some people very wealthy, particularly property owners outside the original area. Before the Bill is introduced will the Taoiseach give a guarantee to the House that some economic analysis will be carried out?  Is the Taoiseach aware that, in addition to the two companies mentioned by the Taoiseach &mdash; Temple Bar Properties Limited and Temple Bar Renewal &mdash; other companies such as Temple Bar Developments and Temple Bar '91 have recently been registered in the Companies Office?  The latter company were registered by people describing themselves as Shelf Company Formation <Col N="2050" /> Agents.  They have a range of companies such as Adventure International, Bambi International, Century Computers and Larchfield International.  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that there is no conflict or interaction between these companies and Temple Bar Properties and Temple Bar Renewal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly assure the Deputy very firmly in regard to the last point.  His views are a surprise to me but I suspect that the companies are nothing more than aggressive private enterprise.  I assure the Deputy that they will have no influence, connection or association with Temple Bar Properties Limited or Temple Bar Renewal Limited, which will have their own specific missions.  I do not want to speculate on why this other range of companies is being formed by other groups but it may be that they want to take possession of the names for their own purposes.  They will certainly not in any way be associated with the two companies which this House will establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I will take his suggestion about some sort of economic analysis being made.  There is no particular reason, other than good urban development reasons, for the size of the area.  It was not decided by my Department in particular; it was decided mainly by Dublin Corporation and by the local community development people.  It is a homogenous area stretching from Fishamble Street to Trinity College and the western part of it should definitely be included because it is very much part of the old Viking Dublin.  I am sure the House will have a full opportunity to examine all these aspects when I introduce the legislation.  We can fully discuss all these matters and I assure Deputies that I have a very open mind on how we should proceed.  This is a fairly good structure.  It meets the particular problem which presented itself to us there.  If Deputies can come up with better suggestions, better ideas or more interesting proposals I would be very happy to <Col N="2051" /> receive them when we are debating the legislation.</P>

What procedures existed to make sure there was absolute security and confidentiality about the area to be designated before that announcement was made so that no one outside the close area of the public service would have had such information?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if anyone could have made any great money.  The key properties in the area, the ones which were for sale, were either owned by Dublin Corporation or CIE.  It was these properties in which the Government and the local community were interested.  It was from the existence and ownership of these properties that the whole idea developed.  I could not guarantee that there was not a fair amount of community discussion about the size of the area.  I would imagine that the people in the community development council would have had an input into the size of the area.  It certainly would have been a matter for Dublin Corporation and I am not aware that there was any particular property interest in it.</P>

      <P>Yes, we have and I expressed that view at the Rome Summit at which these matters were discussed. The Irish Government's primary interest in this area would be in regard to the control of the export of armaments.  That <Col N="2055" /> is the question to which all of us should be addressing our minds in view of recent developments in different parts of the world, even in the Gulf.  As I understand the situation, the principal suppliers of armaments to the Gulf area were the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.  We will have to try to ensure, either through the Community by its own mechanisms or by the Community taking action at the UN, that we will have some sort of sensible and civilised regime in regard to the control of the export of armaments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While one would wish to applaud and support what the Taoiseach has said in regard to arms exports, this is not what the question is about. The question concerns the opening up of defence industries to the disciplines of the European internal market, in particular, the provisions in regard to open tendering, public procurement, so that all Community countries would be entitled to compete.  Would the Taoiseach agree that it would be in the interests of the Community that smaller countries be able to compete for contracts if such contracts are available elsewhere in the Community, and that there are Irish industries which could benefit from this?  Does he agree, therefore, that Ireland should be of the view that the internal market disciplines should apply in respect of all aspects of industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, at present the position is governed by Article 223 of the Treaty which restricts the applicability of market disciplines to the arms industry in general.  There is a wide range of approaches to this matter in the IGC at present.  One of the proposals in that Article 223 should be abolished. There are other less sweeping changes proposed.  This is a very fluid situation with different countries putting forward their own proposals.  I want to say to the Deputy that we are not in that league and I hope we will never be armaments suppliers to the world at large.  I would be inclined to confine <Col N="2056" /> Ireland's interest in the matter to being in conformity with our general approach to world affairs, namely, that we are in favour of world disarmament to the greatest extent possible.</P>

Given that that manufacturing capacity exists in this country and, regardless of whether we like it, the armaments industry does exist, there should be the possibility for Irish companies to tender for any contracts which are available anywhere in the Community in the interests of employment in this country.

      <P>At this stage I am wary of the evolution of the Community towards giving more powers to the European Parliament particularly because of our situation as a small member state with very minuscule representation in the European Parliament, whatever the calibre of that representation may be.  In so far as the interests of the smaller member states are concerned, they are more adequately protected by the fact that in the European Councils each member state has equal status.  Of course, the Commission has a special role to cater for the interests of the smaller member states in many ways.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that he is virtually alone among European leaders in taking the view that the powers of the European Parliament should not be enhanced?  Is the Taoiseach further aware that the German Chancellor stated he would not be prepared to agree to economic and monetary union <Col N="2060" /> and European political union unless the powers of the European Parliament are enhanced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are widely differing views about this throughout the Community.  I am not alone in looking at any major accretion of powers to the European Parliament with some disquiet. There is fairly general agreement on a number of improvements in the capacity of the European Parliament in economic and monetary union and in political union.  Basically, the position of the smaller member states can best be protected through the Commission and through the equal status we have in the different Councils.  I know the German Chancellor has a pretty strong view about the power of the European Parliament and he is perfectly entitled to that but his strong views in that regard are not widely shared throughout the Community at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 17 together. The Government welcome the first statement of the Commission on the Status of Women and I have already announced publicly the decision of the Government to accept fully in principle the recommendations in the first statement.  Steps have already been taken to implement the recommendations.</P>
      <P>The age barrier on recruitment has already been raised for appropriate competitions to 50.  All Ministers have been instructed to include in their memoranda to Government the probable impact, if any, on women of measures proposed; to work progressively towards the criteria recommended by the commission in appointments to State boards; and to ensure that national lottery funding will not go to private clubs which do not give women the right to apply for full membership.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are being made to appoint a woman to the Top Level Appointments Committee.  The Minister for Education is intent on ensuring that the primary curriculum is reviewed to exclude all sexism and sex-stereotyping.</P>
      <P>Legislation is in preparation to provide for joint ownership of the family home and household chattels but the outcome of a case before the Supreme Court must be awaited before the new legislation can be finally drafted.  I am sure the Deputies will agree &mdash; as was acknowledged by the commission &mdash; that this is a very positive response by the Government to the recommendations made by the commission.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's positive response to the statement today in relation to the recommendations made by the commission.  Is the Taoiseach taking any steps to rectify <Col N="2062" /> the position with regard to State-sponsored bodies 69 of which, I understand, have no women at all involved in them, out of the 200 agencies that exist?  Will he indicate if there are any vacancies at the moment on any of those 69 boards which do not have women and can he indicate what procedures are in place to try to fill such vacancies with suitably qualified women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing is to accept the principle that we should have representation of women at the highest level possible on those State polls.  The first statement of the Commission on the Status of Women has put forward suggestions in that regard.  It must be a gradual process.  We have to deal with it on a day-to-day basis as vacancies arise and try to make sure we find suitably qualified women to fill these vacancies.  That is the policy of the Government.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that we should commend the commission for bringing forward so quickly seven recommendations which would not entail a cost to the Exchequer?  I commend the Taoiseach for giving a positive response but may I ask him if he sees a need to give a specific Minister responsibility to implement these recommendations? May I further ask him, with regard to the recommendation relating to lottery funding for clubs, what instructions have been given to the Department of the Environment and to the local authorities in relation to requests for funding from clubs which may be discriminating against women?

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 21, 72 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>The preparation of the heads of the new housing Bill is proceeding as a matter or urgency in my Department.  I am not in a position, at this stage, to give a precise date for the publication of the Bill.  However, most of the measures contained in the policy document, <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> which I published on 14 February last can be, and are being, implemented without new primary legislation and where such legislation is required this is clearly indicated in the document.</P>
      <P>The up-to-date position regarding the implementation of each of the principal measures in the plan is as follows:</P>
      <P> 1.  <i>House Purchase and Improvement Loans:</i> Increased loan and income limits, effective from 14 February 1991, were formally notified to local authorities on 26 February 1991.</P>
      <P>2.  <i>Voluntary Housing Scheme:</i> A circular notifying the increased grant limits and other improvements to the voluntary housing scheme, and the new scheme for communal facilities issued to local authorities on 11 April 1991. The new limits and so on apply to works commenced since 14 February.</P>
      <P>3.  <i>Rental Subsidy for Voluntary Housing:</i> A circular giving the full operational details of the scheme issued to local authorities on 3 May 1991.  Detailed discussions have been held with representatives of voluntary housing bodies.  In fact, one project has already been approved under the scheme and others in various locations are in preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  <i>Housing Sites:</i> A circular giving the terms of a scheme for the provision of sites by local authorities to qualified individuals and co-operatives at low or <Col N="2066" /> nominal prices issued to local authorities on 1 May 1991.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>Mortgage Allowance for Tenants:</i> This £3,300 allowance is available in cases where contracts to purchase private houses are entered into by local authority tenants or tenant purchasers after 14 February 1991.  There have been discussions with the financial institutions regarding the operation of this scheme.  The circular giving operational details will issue to local authorities this week.</P>
    <P>6.  <i>Shared Ownership System:</i> As stated in the plan, this scheme, which is new to this country, requires legislation. Expert legal advice has been sought on its possible implementation on an interim basis pending the legislation. If it proves possible to devise interim arrangements, local authorities should be in a position to deal with applications in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>7.  <i>Improvements-Extensions instead of Local Authority Housing:</i> Local authority managers have already been requested to examine waiting lists to ascertain cases for which this scheme would be appropriate.  A circular notifying allocations and authorising local authorities to proceed with works under the scheme issued on 3 May 1991.  Expert legal advice is being sought by the Department on the form of agreement to be entered into between the authority and the applicant and local authorities will be advised when this is available.  There is no reason, however, why implementation cannot be pressed ahead on the basis of the circular already issued.</P>
    <P>8.  <i>Bathrooms Sub-Programme:</i> A circular giving allocations and other details of the bathrooms scheme for local authority dwellings issued on 26 April 1991.</P>
    <P>9.  <i>Homeless People:</i> Revised guidelines, including new financial arrangements in relation to the accommodation needs of homeless <Col N="2067" /> people, issued to local authorities on 3 May 1991.</P>
    <P>10.  <i>Travelling People:</i> A circular reminding local authorities of their responsibilities in relation to the accommodation needs of travelling people and asking each authority to draw up a clearly defined set of proposals to meet identified needs issued to local authorities on 1 May 1991.</P>
    <P>11.  <i>Private Rented Accommodation:</i> As stated in the plan, the very significant safeguards announced for private tenants will require new legislation and will be provided for in the new housing Bill. </P>
    <P>
      <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> is a major policy document of great significance in the social housing area and has been acknowledged as such in many quarters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan contains new thinking on the approach to the provision of decent and suitable housing for households that are not in a position to provide it from their own resources.  It contains radical new measures to improve access to housing, to expand housing choice and to improve the position of both public and private tenants.  Although basically a policy document, it contains a considerable amount of detail in relation to the various new schemes proposed.</P>
      <P>As is evident from this reply, considerable progress has already been made in advancing the implementation of the various measures proposed.  The House can be assured that remaining action necessary on the part of my Department to secure the full and speedy implementation of the plan will continue to be pursued with all possible vigour.</P>

As regards the specifics of the plan, which is a Lego-land policy to distort the realities of the inability of this Government and this Minister to build houses for the people in need, when will the Bill come before this House?  It is totally unacceptable for a plan announced nearly nine weeks ago now to be still at the heads of Bill stage in relation to the implementation of its most important detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that he has failed fundamentally in his first responsibility, to provide houses for the 25,000 people urgently and desperately in need and who will not be in any way relieved by the nonsense contained in these ephemeral proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right when he says the plan covers a wide range of different proposals and most of these <Col N="2069" /> proposals, as I said, require only secondary legislation to be done by regulations under existing Housing Acts.  As I pointed out, the detailed circulars have issued on ten of the 11 principal policy areas.  The matters have been discussed with the managers of the various local authorities and housing officers, and that policy will continue too.  I suggest there is normally a time for the publication of major new directions in a key area such as housing and the making of arrangements for implementation on the ground. Extensive discussions with voluntary housing organisations and financial institutions have been concluded and the matters are being processed as quickly as possible.  In the one area of the shared ownership it was quite clearly signalled from the very start in the publication of the social housing plan that that would require a legislative framework.  We are seeking to put that in place if at all possible on an interim basis to allow us to get on with it, but certainly it is getting top priority in the formulation of a Housing Bill.  It is a major step forward and I think the Deputy will agree that substantially increased funding has been made available for housing this year, and it is my hope that in the very near future we will be able to get the Housing Bill through, which will enable the couple of outstanding items of the plan to be fully implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that since he published the plan three months ago not a single site has been provided, not a single extension built, not a single person has qualified for the mortgage subsidy or for shared ownership, not a single new dwelling has been provided as a result of this plan?  Will he further confirm that at the present rate of progress the plan he published three months ago will not provide a single additional unit of accommodation in 1991 and that the circulars he has referred to which have been sent to local authorities contain little more than the details set out in the plan itself, that his policy for dealing with the housing crisis is now in tatters, that the housing crisis is now out <Col N="2070" /> of control and that he has no answer to offer to the numbers of people, now approaching 30,000, who are waiting for housing in this State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further question down on the Order Paper dealing with that matter and I will give precisely the number of returns I have.  Certainly I do not have the returns from all the authorities as requested of them, and I am pursuing that matter with them.  Of course, in the two-pronged approach we are taking, the local authority building programme is continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We also have increased the money as far as voluntary housing is concerned.  We had some 500 units completed last year under that heading and I expect that to be more this year. All these headings are being pursued vigorously. The housing plan is being received favourably, with considerable interest being shown from every single housing authority in the country.  With the issue of the circulars and, we hope, the completion of a model that can be used on an interim basis instead of the legislation for the shared ownership scheme, we expect to have that in place at an early date.  One way or the other, the plan is a fundamental change in thinking and will, as stated in the plan itself, lead to a very substantial increase in the number of units to be provided over the next few years, the figure being 5,000 from the plan itself with a possible 5,000 other units from the building programme and casual vacancies.  That will be a very substantial way of dealing with housing, <Col N="2071" /> plus the increased funding which is substantially increased this year over last year's allocation.</P>

      <P>Full returns from the housing authorities of their assessments at 31 March 1991 of the scale of homelessness to which they may have to respond in their areas are not yet available to the Department.</P>
      <P>
        <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> outlines the specific measures being taken to strengthen the response to homelessness. Housing authorities have been requested to utilise fully their powers under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, to secure accommodation for homeless persons.  In order to facilitate this, guidelines on the operation of section 10 have been revised and issued to housing authorities.  They introduce more flexible financial arrangements where a voluntary body provides accommodation for homeless people. They also put greater emphasis on the need for formal ongoing liaison on the part of housing authorities with the voluntary bodies and for arrangements to provide an emergency response service.</P>

Will he explain what steps he has taken to get these reports from local authorities to be able to account to this House for the homeless?</P>

      <P>As I have stated, the returns have not been received from all housing authorities.  Returns have been received from 11 authorities and there are still 76 outstanding.  I do not regard that as acceptable.  We have contacted them with a view to getting those returns and we need them, but of course it does not prevent them using section 10 of the 1988 Housing Act for the benefit of the homeless.  As I said, I have issued the revised circular to deal with such items as the need to establish formal, ongoing liaison arrangements with the voluntary bodies providing the accommodation. We are also asking for an improvement from local authorities in providing an emergency response for homeless persons and, as a consequence of the review, more flexible financial arrangements are being introduced.  Financial contributions can now be made to a body on a regular basis such as monthly or quarterly where that body provide accommodation for homeless persons.  We want to use the money that has been available to us for the past couple of years and which was not fully utilised as I explained to the Deputy on a previous occasion.  We want to utilise the powers available under section 10.  We have reviewed the situation with a view to pointing out to local authorities how better they can exercise that power.  The fact that they have not sent in the numbers to us does not prevent them from going ahead now.</P>

      <P>In the first instance one has to wait to see if local authorities will respond to the request to carry out the surveys.  I understand they have done their work, are correlating the evidence and statistics and will send the information to the Department.  I am awaiting this information from 76 authorities and I hope to receive the information in the immediate future.  The 1988 Act is quite specific as to what we would like them to do in relation to homelessness.  We are hoping that the new guidelines will press them on to utilise fully that power.  Then there are increased limits in regard to voluntary housing schemes.  This applies also to the accommodation of homeless people.  We have increased the grant to 95 per cent of capital expenditure for homeless people and the threshold up to £2,000 per unit for single or double accommodation and up to £25,000 for family accommodation.  I understand from the voluntary organisations that this is a major advance.</P>

      <P>I requested county and city engineers to take speedy action on potholes when I met them on 12 April last. As one would expect, the response was a very positive one and I was assured that such action would be taken as weather conditions improved and permitted.  In particular the engineers agreed to carry <Col N="2074" /> out in the following weeks a crash programme to deal with the backlog of urgent repairs.</P>
      <P>The cost of works on non-national roads falls to be financed from local authorities' own resources, complemented by discretionary grants from my Department. In 1989, I introduced a new discretionary grant mechanism involving both a block grant for improvement of regional and county roads, and also a block grant for maintenance of these roads.</P>

      <P>In 1986, the year the Deputy continually refers to, £15.4 million was given by the then Government by way of block grant for the maintenance of these roads.  County road strengthening in that year cost £5 million.  This, together with the western package which has since vanished, made a total of £23 million in 1986.  Recognising that their predecessors had left behind them a bad scene, the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 and 1988 increased the total to £33.4 million.  In 1989 it was increased to £47.4 million; in 1990, £66.88 million; and in 1991, £68.13 million.  It was the first time in the history of this State that a three-year programme of maintenance on county roads was initiated and the figure was £150 million. Because we recognised that the party opposite had left such a mess behind them that was increased to £180 million.</P>

      <P>I wish, Sir, to express the opposition of my party to the taking of the Bill in this fashion.  This Bill contains measures which are quite far-reaching in <Col N="2200" /> the powers they confer on the Minister for the Environment.  There is no urgency in regard to the major part of this legislation. The proposal to initiate debate on the Bill after allowing effectively only one, or at most, two working days for Members to study it prior to its being discussed here; also, in view of the fact that the explanatory memorandum concerning the Bill has been sent to Deputies only this morning it seems to me that it is precipitate of the Government to seek to initiate the debate so quickly.  Furthermore, there is no need to insist that the Bill be fully enacted as quickly as proposed.  It seems to me and to my party that considerable time ought to be allowed for Committee Stage of the Local Government Reform Bill in view of the many questions that need to be asked and answered concerning individual powers to be exercised by the Minister and by local authorities.  We need to have sufficient time for all these matters to be teased out in an unhurried fashion.  The experience we have had in regard to time-tables being imposed on Committee Stages of Bills is that only a few sections of those Bills are ever discussed and the remainder of the Bill is not discussed because if one gets into contention on the earlier part of a Bill the latter part is never reached, and that is undesirable.  I hope the Minister would accept the case we are making that more time should be allowed for Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I will address my remarks to the Order of Business and the proposals made by the Taoiseach for the Order of Business.  I want to convey my serious concern to you, Sir, and to the House in relation to the manner in which this Bill is being introduced.  Reform of <Col N="2201" /> local government has been promised for a long time.  I would say to the Taoiseach and to the Government that they are now showing undue haste in relation to publishing a Bill last Friday and publishing the explanatory memorandum this very afternoon and expecting the House to debate it straightaway.  Motion No. 8 on today's Order Paper, which in effect is a guillotine motion, is entirely incompatible with Standing Order 58 (1) of the orders of this House.  I am sure you are familiar with that Standing Order which prohibits the Ceann Comhairle from allowing debate on any matter to be curtailed if you consider it to be an infringement of the rights of any minority group in this House.  Motion No. 8 is a gross infringement of that Standing Order of the House.</P>
      <P>I would like also to draw your attention, more particularly, to Standing Order 143.  I will quote this Standing Order, Sir, because it is of extreme importance in relation to this proposal. It reads:</P>
      <P>Any Standing Order or Orders of the Dáil may be suspended or modified in effect for the day's sitting, and for a particular purpose, upon motion made after notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which this motion is drafted in the name of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach is a clear breach of Standing Order 143 which I have just quoted.  The Standing Orders of this House are a legal instrument, the authority for which is derived from the Constitution, and also they are subject to judicial review.  If the motion in its present form is passed and if the debate goes ahead as scheduled by the Government, then the Local Government Reform Bill may be passed through this House on foot of a motion which is out of order and, thus, in all probability illegal.  We are on the brink of an acutely dangerous situation.  I have done some research into Standing Order 143.  I believe it has not been offered as a challenge to the Order of Business prior to this and I would ask you, Sir, to satisfy yourself in relation to the motion before <Col N="2202" /> you, that it complies fully with the Standing Orders of this House, otherwise we may be creating a very dangerous precedent.</P>

I can tell Deputy Spring now that in respect of the adequacy of the notice and allocation of time motion before us that the motion does conform with the long-established precedents regarding the allocation of time motions which rarely receive the four days' notice.  I am satisfied that Members have had sufficient time to study the implications of this motion.  It is on the Order Paper for today for all to peruse and to take note of. There are a number of precedents which actuate the Chair in regard to this matter. I have very many precedents before me today which I can give to the House.

      <P>In so far as the Taoiseach's motion is concerned, an allocation of time motion is normal practice in this House.  The Taoiseach, in announcing the Order of Business, frequently proposes arrangements for the taking of items of business subject, of course, always to the agreement of the House.  That is precisely what he is doing here today.  I will be putting the proposal to the House, in the usual way, shortly, having afforded the spokespersons for the Opposition parties an opportunity of commenting thereon and the House will decide the issue in the normal way.</P>

In relation to Standing Order 143 (1) whereas the Taoiseach and the Government may have abridged time for one day, you, Sir, cannot allow them to abridge time and set the debate in this House for four days irrespective of whether it has been done in the past; it is not within the orders of this House.  This matter is so serious that you may want to adjourn the House for a period to fully consult in relation to it.

My party oppose the procedure of guillotining it without debate I suggest that the point raised by Deputy Spring be dealt with in that debate and the House could then make up its mind whether it regards the matter as in order. The Government may even have second thoughts about whether the matter was adequately debated here in the House.</P>
      <P>It is totally improper to have a Bill brought before this House at such short notice effectively giving something like 35 hours in total for debating a Bill which has 55 sections.  The effect of the proposal in relation to Committee Stage, is to provide less than ten minutes per section.  That is totally inadequate, particularly if it is to live up to the claim of the Minister for the Environment that this Bill is a major reform of local government. It seems to me that the mess which will be created as a result of this Bill will haunt this Government in much the same way as the Broadcasting Bill haunted this Government and continues to haunt them.  The Minister could, if he wished, solve the problem he has with regard to postponing the elections to UDCs and of town commissioners by an order under the Local Government Act, 1973.  He does not have to rush this Bill through the House by 17 May to achieve that.

I have not the slightest doubt from my long experience in this House that for a Bill of this kind that is more than adequate and is, in fact, a very generous allocation of time.  I understand, a Cheann Comhairle, that you do not permit us to deal with the merits of the Bill itself, therefore I shall refrain from doing that.  Perhaps I would be allowed make the comment that it is not by any means anything in the nature of major revolutionary constitutional type of legislation.</P>

Perhaps when the Taoiseach is lodging his speech in the library he would lodge Deputy O'Malley's speech also.

There was then introduced in the middle of this session promised legislation in the form of a Bill relating to Temple Bar to which no reference was made in that schedule, <Col N="2214" /> although obviously it was being contemplated since the Temple Bar company was established.  Two weeks ago we were told that Committee Stage of the Finance Bill would begin on 14 May but I understand now it is the intention of the Government to postpone that by at least two days to accomodate pushing through the local government legislation. In the light of the uncertainty, and perhaps confusion, in the Cabinet, will the Taoiseach clarify the Government's legislative intentions between now and the end of this session?</P>

It is not a definitive list but is merely an indication of the legislation it is hoped to take, and it has always been subject to variation as the session goes on.  At the moment the major piece of legislation before the House is the legislation we are about to deal with now on local government reform.  We will then complete the Finance Bill and the Competition Bill, which I know is regarded as important by the parties.  I hope to take the Temple Bar legislation which I do not think will be very contentious or will take much time.  Apart from giving priority to those areas, I have promised the House that we will have a wide-ranging debate on European affairs.  These will be the main highlights between now and the end of the session.  We will then proceed with the list as published.</P>

      <P>The Chair is completely satisfied in respect of the matter under discussion.  I have called the Minister a number of times to move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. There is no ambiguity in the matter in so far as the Chair is concerned.  I am calling on the Minister to proceed with the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Just 12 months ago both Houses of the Oireachtas confirmed by resolution an order postponing the local elections due in June 1990, until June 1991.  The reason for that postponement was to enable the carrying out of a full and urgent review of the local government system so that legislative changes could be put in place before new authorities are elected.  That review was carried out and the Government's proposals for the implementation of a local government reform programme were announced in a detailed statement issued two months ago on 7 March 1991.  Every Member of the House has, therefore, had a good opportunity to consider these proposals and I expect that this will help to ensure an informed and positive debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>I will return presently to the substance of the reform programme in general and the contents of the Bill in particular. First, however, I would like to set these in perspective by sketching, in the briefest possible terms, some of the key events in the evolution of our system of local government and the reason reform and reorganisation of that system is now necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the foundation of the State we inherited a system of local government which was, in large measure, a product <Col N="2225" /> of a series of 19th century statutes culminating in the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898 which consolidated the principal structural features of our local government system.</P>
    <P>Since independence, the local government system has been adapted and extended in a number of respects.  Certain functions have declined in importance, others have increased, some functions were removed &mdash; health services for example &mdash; and many new ones added in environmental, planning and development and other areas.  This continuing change in functional responsibilities, adapting to meet the needs and demands of the day, has continued under a succession of statutes to the present time.  A management system was in operation in all authorities by the early forties with various key functions and decisions reserved as the exclusive prerogative of the elected members, but there has been no significant change in organisational or structural arrangements since then.</P>
    <P>The question of overall reform and reorganisation has been a consistently recurring theme in the local government area for several decades past.  It is a debate which has displayed some remarkably consistent features.  For example, opinions as to the shape and direction which reform should take have tended to conflict sharply.  Secondly, it seems that there has always been a sort of inverse relationship between the volume of discussion about reform and the extent of the action resulting from this.  Thirdly, whenever it looked as if decisions and real action were about to be taken, this proved to be an illusion and a further period of stagnation ensued.</P>
    <P>It was at one such period that I came to office as Minister for the Environment. It quickly became clear to me that if progress was to be made a new approach must be adopted.  I became convinced that if the interests of local government were to be properly served the reform question should not be treated as a political football.  It was, and is, my view that, in order to achieve the desired results, proposals must be formulated on the basis of a thorough consideration of <Col N="2226" /> all views and they must have the support of a solid across-the-board consensus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is precisely what the Government set out to achieve in their approach to local government reform. An Oireachtas all-party committee on the matter was initially proposed, as this seemed to offer the best prospect of securing the desired consensus.  Regrettably, this proposal did not seem to meet with favour on all sides of the House and the main Opposition party refused to participate.  I hope this is not to be taken as a measure of their commitment to the local government system.</P>
      <P>At that stage, it would have been very easy to turn aside and allow local government to once again slide off the political agenda.  The Government were determined, however, to press ahead with developing reform proposals through alternative mechanisms.  A Cabinet sub-committee was established in April 1990 and an advisory expert committee was appointed to assest them.  By adopting this approach, the Government ensured that the issue would receive due priority by being considered at the highest level while, at the same time, facilitating a wide input to the review process and bringing special expertise to bear on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that this mechanism has worked extremely well.  The advisory expert committee, which received a large number of submissions from interested individuals and organisations, completed their report just before Christmas and, as Deputies will be aware, the report has been published.  The Government had hoped that the committee could have completed their work some months earlier, but the complexity of the assignment and the number of submissions received, made it necessary for the committee to seek an extension of the time limit set for them.  I cannot let this opportunity pass without paying tribute to the chairman and members of the expert committee for the time and effort they devoted to their task.  I am sure that all Members of <Col N="2227" /> the House will concur when I say that we are indebted to them for their work in the interests of local government.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet sub-committee, which I chaired, considered the report of the expert committee in January and February this year and made their own report to the Government.  After due consideration, the Government decided on the reorganisation programme and a full statement of their proposals was made on 7 March last.  The substantial Bill now before the House has been drafted, as a matter of high priority, in the relatively short period since then and has been brought before the House at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I have set out in some detail the sequence of events since April 1990 in order to show that there has been no avoidable delay on the Government's part in preparing and presenting this Bill. On the contrary, once it became clear last year that an all-party approach was not possible, we moved with top speed to meet the commitment to put legislative changes in place before the coming elections.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, appropriate that I should also explain at this stage why it is necessary that the Bill should be passed by both Houses no later than 17 May.  The legal requirements concerning the timescale for the holding of the local elections are as follows.  The elections must be held in June and, as already announced, the polling day will be on 27 June which is just about the latest practicable date.  In turn, this means that the final date for publication of the notice of elections by returning officers is 24 May.  This means that the Ministerial order appointing the polling day will have to be made not later than 22 May.  The final date for the signature of the Bill by the President is, therefore, 21 May and &mdash; even assuming early signature &mdash; the final date for the Bill to be passed by both Houses is 17 May.  If the Bill is not passed by that date, elections cannot be held in June in County Dublin or postponed at the sub-county level.  While this timescale is tight, the blame cannot be laid at the door <Col N="2228" /> of the Government.  As I have already explained, there has been no avoidable delay on our part in dealing with this matter.  Furthermore, an ample amount of time is being made available for consideration of the Bill by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The decisions already taken by the Government make it clear that there is to be no more long-fingering of local government reform and no seeking of pretexts on which to dodge decisions. The statement of 7 March spells out both what is being done immediately and what must, for practical reasons, be dealt with on a progressive basis.  On this point, however, it must be stressed that the programme will be a fully integrated one. There is no question, for example, of adopting only a minimal range of provisions now for the sake of short term expediency and postponing those which are of real importance to some vague future date.  Although further legislation will be necessary to complete the programme and deal with all consequential matters, the Bill which is now before the House provides a broad framework for reform within which implementation can proceed in an ordered, progressive fashion.</P>
    <P>I will return very shortly to the contents of the Bill itself but first I think it is important in the context of a Bill of such fundamental significance, to reflect briefly on some underlying principles of the reform programme.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that one of the main reasons previous promises of reform failed to bear fruit was the fact that, although there seemed to be general agreement on the need for reform, this was not, for the most part, based on a clear understanding of what is really involved. The reasons for reform and, indeed, the essential purposes of local government itself may not have been rigorously thought through.  As a result, the &ldquo;reform movement&rdquo;&mdash; and by that I mean both promises of, and demands for, local government reform &mdash; has enjoyed neither the degree of authority nor conviction necessary to carry a realistic programme through to finality.  Regrettably, <Col N="2229" /> local government reform has often tended to be little more than an empty catch cry.</P>
    <P>Why do we need reform of local government?  In order to approach that question perhaps I might first try to dispose of some popular misconceptions on the subject.  The reason we need reform is not that local authorities are doing a bad job, since not only do local authorities provide many of the essential services, such as water and sanitation, without which civilised, healthy living would be impossible, but they also provide a remarkable range of amenities and facilities such as swimming pools, libraries and parks, to mention but a few, which serve a valuable social and community role as well as helping to enhance greatly the quality of our lives.  They have an indispensable role in the area of social housing.  They provide much of the infrastructure essential to economic development while at the same time ensuring that development proceeds in a rational and orderly manner and that the valuable resources of our environment are protected and enhanced.</P>
    <P>Problems may arise occasionally, or in certain areas, and these tend to attract disproportionate attention, but this should serve to point out how much we take local authority services for granted in the normal course.  We seem to think of local authorities only when a problem arises or, perhaps, when we are asked to contribute towards their services.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another common misconception.  Prophets of doom have, in the past, claimed that the local authority system was on the verge of collapse and that the local authorities were in financial crisis.  While that does not reflect the position today, some Members will inevitably attempt to find fault with the Government's reform programme on the grounds that it does not have enough to say about local authority finance.  Such a criticism would, however, indicate a flawed perspective and a lack of appreciation of the correct sequence of events.</P>
    <P>The first requirement is to get the structures, systems, functions and operations of local authorities right &mdash; to attempt <Col N="2230" /> any financial adjustments in advance of this would, quite simply, be a case of putting the cart before the horse.  Moreover, if we get these things right, that in itself will go a long way to ensuring continued financial wellbeing.  We have already come a long way on that road over the past four years.  In line with the Government's own programme to restore the national finances, local authorities have achieved greater budgetary discipline.  The need to contain expenditure within available resources is now the guiding principle.  As a result, serious deficts which had been accumulated over a number of years have now been considerably reduced.  This, as any sensible person will appreciate, has had to be the priority.  The Government have also helped in this regard by implementing several sound practical reforms and rationalisation measures such as the elimination of the circular loans and subsidies system and reduction of extraneous financial burdens.  A further example this year is the new arrangement for court-house maintenance.</P>
    <P>The continuation of this practical and disciplined approach will continue to be the Government's priority in relation to local finances, with other adjustments being considered, where necessary, at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>A scoping study was conducted by the London Institute of Fiscal Studies, at the request of the Advisory Expert Committee, regarding central funding for local authorities.  Their report, which was published along with the advisory committee's own report, concludes that our system of funding and our range of grants stands up quite well by international comparison. The report does, however, see scope for greater equalisation, primarily in the distribution of the rates support grant.  I have, therefore, commissioned the necessary follow-up study to examine precise options for achieving greater equalisation among local authorities.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is not, however, a financial provisions measure.  It does not purport to be, it was never intended to be and, for the reasons I have outlined, it is not appropriate that it should be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2231" /> Another popular cliché in recent times has been the claim that local authorities have become powerless.  The facts, however, do not support this.  The powers and functions of local authorities have been added to considerably in a whole series of statutes which have been enacted in recent years.  Indeed, during my own time as Minister, the Oireachtas has seen fit to enact several important pieces of legislation conferring significant powers and responsibilities on local authorities. There have been, or are currently in preparation, Bills dealing with air pollution, water pollution, housing, roads, planning, urban renewal and derelict sites.  Regulations made to give effect to various EC Directives have also added considerably to local functions.</P>
    <P>In recent years, local authorities have been given a new and more dynamic type of role in the pursuit of some important social and economic objectives.  New departures such as the urban renewal scheme and the recently announced social housing plan are examples of this, involving increased discretion and scope for initiative on the part of local authorities. At the same time, I can point to the very significant increase in discretionalry road grants &mdash; from £23 million in 1986 to £68 million in the current year &mdash; as an example of how local authority discretion has been enhanced even within a very traditional sphere of operations.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that a simplistic or superficial approach to local government reform will not suffice.  It is necessary to be clear about the essential purpose of the local government system and the <i>raison dere</i> of the authorities which constitute it.</P>
    <P>I think that the Members of this House will appreciate my meaning when I say that there is an important distinction to be drawn between &ldquo;local government&rdquo; and &ldquo;local administration&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Local government&rdquo; involves much more than just the provision of services &mdash; important though that role is.  What gives local government a unique character and sets <Col N="2232" /> local authorities apart from other executive type agencies, is their democratic representational role.  Thus, it follows that a fundamental purpose and objective of local government reform must be to strengthen local democracy.</P>
    <P>The fact that local authorities are democratically elected does not of itself guarantee that they will be able to discharge their representational role as effectively as they should.  Despite the considerable achievements for which local authorities can take credit, the public perception of them is frequently a negative one.  This, I believe, is largely because they often appear as simply bureaucratic institutions remote from the community.</P>
    <P>The structures, functions and operating methods of local government must be correctly attuned to the demographic, social and economic circumstances of today.  Local authorities must interact with the communities they represent and that interaction must be a two-way process. It must operate in such a way as to ensure that the authority are fully cognisant of the problems, needs, priorities and aspirations of their community and that such awareness is properly reflected in the way they discharge their powers and functions.  Local authorities must be accountable to the people for how they perform on their behalf.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the local authority must have the capacity to promote the interests and development of their area, not just in a direct way through the exercise of their functional powers, but also as a catalyst of local energy and initiative and a facilitator and supporter of the efforts of individuals and groups within the community.  Above all, local government must be made relevant and close to the people, and community participation with local authorities must be fostered. Local government is, after all, the level of government which relates most closely to the day-to-day lives of the people.  If we allow flaws in the system to create a sense of alienation between communities and their representative authorities, a great disservice will be done to our whole democratic system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2233" /> The other side of the local authority persona is, of course, that of being a provider of services, an undertaker of works and a regulator of various local affairs.  It is essential that local authorities achieve the optimum level of efficiency, cost effectiveness and value for money in the provision of works and services.  I believe they have made good progress in this regard over the past few years. However, what is achieved has to be done in an operating environment which, as the law stands, is not always conducive to efficient operation in modern-day conditions. It is a primary aim of the Government's reform programme to ensure that the structural, legal and operational framework within which local authorities operate is suited to today's circumstances and that it will facilitate and promote effective service.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the representational and functional roles of local authorities are complementary rather than conflicting.  The system must operate in such a way that the democratic representational role is not subjugated to the role of the local authority as a provider of works and services.  Operational and administrative efficiency must be pursued as a means towards providing the best possible quality of service to the people.  On the other hand, local authorities must be prepared to operate in a mature, responsible and effective manner and be willing to make choices and, where necessary, take difficult decisions.  The achievement of the correct balance between the operational and representational roles is an important consideration in the reform programme.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a meaningful system of local government the &ldquo;local&rdquo; element must be enhanced as far as possible. Local authorities must be locally focused and there must be an appropriate level of locally-based power and discretion. However, it is obvious also that local government functions have significant implications beyond the local authorities own sphere of operations.  Thus, the question of maintaining a correct balance also arises in this context.  The overall structural set up, and the allocation of <Col N="2234" /> powers and functions, must both reflect an appropriate balance and co-ordination between local authorities and other public agencies and with central Government.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that local government reform involves consideration of a fairly complex matrix of inter-related factors.  Unfortunately, this is not a case where a computer can be programmed and fed with date so as to get a precise solution at the touch of a button.  Nor is it possible to conduct controlled experiments to ascertain the likely results of particular changes.  It is, instead, a matter of judgment and I am satisfied the Government have taken the correct steps to ensure that their judgment is well-informed and soundly based.</P>
    <P>The strategy for implementing reform is crucial to success.  Reform and reorganisation of local government cannot be completed at the stroke of a pen or indeed the passage of an Act.  It must be a process rather than a single action.  In other countries where the local government system has been reformed and revitalised with great success, this process has taken several years to complete.  The report of the expert committee also stressed this point.  However, we are not content merely to issue a set of proposals and wait until every &ldquo;t&rdquo; can be crossed and every &ldquo;i&rdquo; dotted.  That is the approach that has produced inertia in the past.</P>
    <P>The present Bill will get the reform process under way immediately.  In addition, it will provide a legal framework within which a very large share of the detailed components of local government reform can be put in place progressively in an ordered and structured way.  This will, for example, involve the making of various orders and regulations under the enabling powers in the Bill. Other matters will, of course, require further consideration, for example, the results of the proposed fiscal study, the consolidation and modernisation of the general code of local government law and the question of local government structures at the sub-county level, which I will come back to shortly.  However, the <Col N="2235" /> strategy which the Government are following will allow decisions on these matters to be slotted into place without delaying implementation of the reform programme in general.</P>
    <P>I hope I have given the House a reasonably full indication of the general approach underlying this Bill.  I now propose to outline the main features of the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>Part I contains provisions for citations, interpretation, regulations and the like.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill contains provisions relating to the functions of local authorities which are of fundamental importance to the entire reform programme.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides, for the first time, express statutory recognition for the representational functions of local authorities which, as I have already said, is one of the essential purposes of local government.  The section contains provisions in relation to the role of the local authority in representing and promoting the interests of the local community including the representation of views to other public authorities, the promotion and facilitation of involvement in local affairs and the carrying out of local research, surveys or studies.  This will put the local authority to the forefront as the voice of the community and the upholder of its interests.</P>
    <P>A general competence is also being conferred on local authorities to take action in the interests of their local communities. This measure, which is contained in section 6, is designed to give local authorities discretion and flexibility of action in local matters where they are at present unduly constrained by the operation of the <i>ultra vires</i> principle which has often been perceived as a form of legal straitjacket.  It will, therefore, constitute a very significant change in the legal position relating to local authority operations and will bring the position of Irish local government into line with that of local government systems in many European countries.  The section instances various types of measures <Col N="2236" /> which a local authority will be empowered to take within the general competence power.  Certain necessary safeguards are being provided to avoid, for example, activity by local authorities under the section that would prejudice or duplicate the functions of other public bodies.  Matters to which local authorities must have regard in performing functions generally are provided for at section 7, while section 8 will remove doubts about local authorities power to do things which are ancillary or incidental to their specific statutory functions.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the commitment in the Government statement of 7 March to provide for the expansion of the role of the local government system, there is provision at section 9, to devolve new functions from the central level to local authorities.  This provision will enable the Government to transfer by provisional order, to be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas, particular functions which they consider can be effectively discharged by local authorities.  The advisory expert committee mentioned, in their report, various functions which might be considered for devolution, some in areas where local authorities have an involvement at present, others in areas to which the committee felt the local authority role could be extended.  The provision in the Bill will enable specific devolution proposals to be formulated and implemented in a way which is compatible with the reformed system of local government as it evolves, taking all relevant factors into account.  The section provides a flexible mechanism which will allow for devolution of functions in specific areas on an ongoing basis.  A full evaluation will be required, of course, before decisions can be taken as to whether particular functions are appropriate for devolution and factors such as cost, staffing and administrative implications will have to be taken into account.  The section will also allow for the necessary adjustment of functions between classes of local authorities by way of order of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Although it is included in Part VII, rather than in Part II, I must also mention <Col N="2237" /> at this point section 52, which gives power to the Minister to dispense with certain controls affecting local authorities.  This would, for example, enable regulations to be made for the removal or modification of unnecessary procedures or restrictions on local authorities and is, in itself, capable of being used as a powerful instrument for devolution.</P>
    <P>In carrying out their new and wider role in the local community, it is desirable that elected councils should have flexible methods of operation available to them. That is why Part VI, which comprises sections 36 to 40, contains provisions in relation to the establishment of local authority committees, either advisory or with delegated functions.  There is provision also for joint committees to consider matters of concern to two or more authorities.  These provisions will be of assistance where local authorities consider that the use of committees would be beneficial in the discharge of their functions, either from the point of view of operational effectiveness or for the purpose of advice and consultation.  It is not the intention, however, that these provisions should pre-empt in any way the decisions which will have to be taken by the Government in relation to future sub-county structures and section 37 (1) (c) of the Bill makes this absolutely clear. Part VI, is, in effect, a modernisation and consolidation in a flexible form of existing outdated legislation dating back to the 1840s.</P>
    <P>I turn next to the question of powers and functions.  The aspect of local government most obviously in need of review is the structural set-up, which remains in essentially the same format as that created by the Local Government Act of 1898.  It is essential to ensure that the structures themselves do not inhibit good local government and that we have a system which is conducive to both operational efficiency and effective local representation.</P>
    <P>The Government have already indicated general agreement with the advisory committee's recommendation that <Col N="2238" /> the local government system be structured on three levels.  They have confirmed that the county or county borough, as the case may be, will continue to be the primary unit of local government and that eight regional authorities will be established to promote regional-level co-ordination.  The necessary powers to establish the regional authorities and to provide for their functions and other operational aspects are contained in Part VII of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to an order which will be made by me under section 43, there are to be eight regions as follows:</P>
    <P>North West: Donegal; Leitrim; Sligo.</P>
    <P>West: Galway city and county; Mayo; Roscommon.</P>
    <P>Mid-West: Clare; Limerick city and county; Tipperary North Riding.</P>
    <P>South West: Cork city and county; Kerry.</P>
    <P>South East: Carlow; Kilkenny; Tipperary South Riding; Waterford city and county; Wexford.</P>
    <P>Midland: Laois; Longford; Offaly; Westmeath.</P>
    <P>East: Dublin city and county; Kildare; Meath and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>North East: Cavan; Louth; Monaghan.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the regional dimension will derive from the local government system rather than being imposed on it.  The regional authorities will be composed of elected members from county councils and county borough corporations within the region.  They will not, however, be local authorities themselves. The role of the regional authorities will be to promote the co-ordination of public services in the regions and there is no provision in the Bill for any transfer of local authority functions to these bodies.  The formal designation of regions will encourage a greater convergence in regional structures and operations of other public agencies. The need for co-ordination of this <Col N="2239" /> kind becomes apparent when one considers the range of services which are organised regionally, not only through bodies formally constituted on a regional basis but also in terms of various national bodies and services operating through regional or divisional structures.</P>
    <P>The present Bill does not provide for any alteration in local government structures at the sub-county level.  The expert advisory committee failed to produce agreed recommendations on this aspect. Two radically diverging alternatives were discussed in their report.  One would have the effect of eliminating the directly elected sub-county tier entirely.  The other would increase very substantially the number of such authorities and of elected members at this level.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Government must give further consideration to the most appropriate type of local government structures at sub-county level. Because of this, section 14 in Part III of the Bill provides that elections will not be held next June to authorities other than county and county borough councils. Residents of those authorities to which elections are not being held will, of course, be entitled to vote at county council elections in the normal way Part III also contains consequential matters relating to appointment of members of harbour authorities and vocational education committees together with other electoral provisions, including a technical provision to prohibit plural voting at local elections.</P>
    <P>Due to an oversight in the Local Government Reorganisation Act, 1985, in relation to the county borough of Galway, the existing provisions relating to revision of local electoral areas in the longer established county boroughs, which are scattered over a number of different Acts dating from 1929, are being consolidated and applied to all five county boroughs, thus rectifying the Galway situation.  I would like to emphasise, however, that it is not the intention to use this provision prior to the local elections in June.  Besides, section 12 confers no draconian or improper new <Col N="2240" /> powers on the Minister contrary to the claims of some Members opposite.</P>
    <P>Ministers and Ministers of State will be excluded from concurrent membership of a local authority under section 13.  This measure, which was annunced in the Government statement of 7 March, is designed to emphasise the separate roles of the respective levels of representation in their own right.</P>
    <P>While the Government's local government reform programme is a national one, the need for reform, especially from the point of view of structural change, is most acutely felt in the Dublin area.  The scale and intensity of development, population growth and social change require the implementation of special measures for local government in Dublin.  The Government are determined to ensure that this matter will be addressed urgently and effectively and that appropriate, more locally-focused structures will be put in place, with authorities capable of responding effectively to the needs of their communities.</P>
    <P>As previously announced, the Government have decided that the local government system in the Dublin area should be reorganised to take account of the large-scale housing and other development which has occurred since the Dublin structures were last substantially revised 60 years ago.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation will remain and three new authorities will be established at the earliest possible moment to replace Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.</P>
    <P>The June elections will take place on the basis of the three counties determined for electoral purposes in 1985 (but with new titles) as follows: Fingal &mdash; the county area north of the Liffey; Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown &mdash; the county area from Dún Laoghaire to Rathfarnham; and South Dublin &mdash; the county area from Rathfarnham, west to the Liffey.</P>
    <P>Following the elections, the boundary advisory committee provided for in the Bill &mdash; which I will refer to further in a moment &mdash; will review the boundaries of these electoral counties, including the boundary between South Dublin/Dún <Col N="2241" /> Laoghaire-Rathdown which the expert committee felt might run along the main Bray Road.</P>
    <P>In the light of any changes in boundaries which may be decided upon, and taking account of the preliminary results of the April 1991 census, any revision which may be necessary in the membership of the new Dublin Councils can be considered at a later stage.  This will not, of course, affect the June elections.</P>
    <P>The decision to set up three new county councils is aimed at ensuring more relevant and accessible local government with a sharper focus on the needs of the areas served.  We need to take definite steps now, even in this first Bill to get the process under way, rather than repeat the half-hearted measures provided for in the 1985 Act.  Accordingly, as a first practical step in the process of transition to the three new county councils, three statutory committees of the newly elected county council, corresponding to the new county council areas, will be established under the Bill after the elections, one for each of the proposed county areas, and composed of the Members elected for those areas.  Dublin county council will be required to delegate functions, and to operate as far as possible through these committees, and each will have its own area manager to be appointed through the Local Appointments Commission. Pending this, three existing assistant managers will be assigned responsibility for the area committees, each exercising delegated functions appropriate to the area.</P>
    <P>Over a period, the role of the committees will be progressively widened. The area managers after necessary consultations with their area committees, are required by the Bill to submit a joint report on preparations for the establishment of new county councils for the three areas.  In the light of that report, the Minister will make regulations in preparation for the establishment of the new county councils, the dissolution of the present authorities and the transfer of staff, assets, liabilities, property etc. to the new bodies.</P>
    <P>While further legislation will be <Col N="2242" /> required formally to abolish Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation and to establish the three new county councils, I would like to emphasise that, unlike the arrangements made in 1985, the provisions in Part IV of the Bill in relation to Dublin will not cease to have effect after the holding of the local elections.  In fact, the provisions which I have alluded to, will ensure that all of the necessary preparatory steps connected with the structural reorganisation in Dublin can be worked out and given effect to in anticipation of the further legislation.</P>
    <P>An aspect of local government structures where anomalies are readily apparent is in certain local authority boundaries.  Moreover, the existing procedures for alteration of boundaries are cumbersome and the legal provisions fragmented.  A revised set of provisions relating to boundaries is contained in Part V of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for the establishment of independent boundary advisory committees to review local authority boundaries, including local electoral boundaries or other local government matters referred to it.  Provisions relating to the referral of matters to a boundary committee and the submission of reports on boundaries by a committee are contained in sections 31, 32 and 33, respectively. New streamlined proccedures for review and alteration of local authority boundaries are contained in sections 29, 30, 31 and 34.  These include provisions relating to matters such as formulation of boundary proposals, consultation between local authorities concerned, powers of the Minister to alter boundaries and provision for dealing with the various transitional and consequential matters which arise from boundary alterations &mdash; for example, such matters as financial adjustments, transfer of staff, application of Acts or by-laws, etc.  All reports of boundary committees will be published and boundary committees will be independent in the performance of their functions.</P>
    <P>Under this Part a review of local authority boundaries can be initiated by a <Col N="2243" /> local authority or by the Minister but the Minister will be obliged to refer the matter to a boundary committee where there is disagreement between the local authorities concerned or where he considers, on his own initiative, that a boundary alteration should be made.  In the case of an order altering the boundary of a county or county borough, section 3 provides that the order will have to be approved in draft by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it can be made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to boundary alterations will constitute an important element of structural reform and reorganisation of the local government system.  It is proposed, as I have already indicated, that a boundary advisory committee will review the boundaries of the new electoral counties in Dublin after the forthcoming elections.  It is envisaged that a committee will also examine situations where existing boundaries of counties or cities are unsatisfactory and advise on any issues which may arise as a result of decisions on sub-county structures, in due course.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of the system of democratic local government requires that the status of local authorities as public institutions and of their elected members be enhanced.  Part VII contains a number of important provisions towards this end.</P>
    <P>The role and status of the elected members of local authorities is fundamental to the democratic system of local government.  The powers of the elected members are, in law, founded primarily on the concept of &ldquo;reserved functions&rdquo;.  These are the functions which, under the City and County Management Acts, are reserved as the exclusive prerogative of the elected members as distinct from the &ldquo;executive functions&rdquo; exercisable by the manager for the authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill directly specifies a considerable number of important powers and functions as being reserved to the elected members, for example, decisions in relation to representational functions <Col N="2244" /> under section 5, a decision under section 6 regarding activities of benefit to the local community, decisions under section 29 in relation to alteration of boundaries, establishment of committees under Part VI and delegation of functions to certain types of committees.  That list is not exhaustive by any means.  In addition, section 41 (2) will provide a new general power for the Minister to declare additional reserved functions by order.  I intend that a special review group, to include elected members, managers and representatives of my Department, will be set up after the elections to advise on this matter.</P>
    <P>In addition to their role in performing the specific functions reserved to them, the elected members of local authorities occupy a special position of authority and status in relation to the determination of local authority policy and general overview of their authority's operations.  This is appropriate in view of the mandate which they receive from being directly elected.  The reserved functions already tend to correspond with policy making aspects and there are specific powers to impose various requirements on the manager.  However, the fact that the policy making role of the members is not spelt out clearly and succinctly in law has, I believe, caused the role and status of the elected members to be understated. Indeed, I suspect that very many elected members themselves are insufficiently aware of the full extent of the legal power and authority vested in them.  In order to reaffirm and emphasise the paramount role of the elected members in the local government system, section 41 (1), therefore, provides explicit formal recognition of the policy making role of the elected members.</P>
    <P>Part VII deals also with certain other matters pertaining to the conditions of local authority members and contains provisions designed to enhance the civic role of local authorities generally as representative public institutions.  Section 48 empowers local authorities generally to confer civic honours.  Section 49 will provide a statutory basis for local authority <Col N="2245" /> involvement in town twinning arrangements. The major local authorities will be obliged under section 50 to produce annual reports which will be available to the public.  Local authorities will be empowered under section 46 to organise special events for purposes such as receiving distinguished persons.  All local authorities will be empowered to pay allowances to their chairmen under section 42 and section 51 sets out a new flexible statutory framework for the payment of expenses to members of local authorities and representation of local authorities at conferences.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, provides one of the single most important powers available to the elected members of a local authority.  However, its use in relation to planning matters in certain instances and areas has, on occasion, given rise to some disquiet.  The Government are concerned to ensure that this important channel of democratic input to the decision making process is not brought into disrepute and that it will continue to be available to the elected members to use in a responsible manner and in appropriate cases.  They have decided, accordingly, on certain changes in its operation.  In future, for such a resolution to be valid in the case of decisions on individual planning matters, three-quarters of the total membership of the local authority must vote in favour and the notice of motion must be signed by three-quarters of the members from the electoral area or areas concerned. This is provided for in section 44 of the Bill.  The corresponding provisions in relation to material contravention of a development plan are also being amended so that three-quarters of the total membership must vote in favour; this is contained in section 45.</P>
    <P>In line with the now established practice in the Civil Service in relation to the appointment of secretaries of Departments and the general trend towards encouraging mobility, there is provision in section 47 to prescribe a maximum term of office for future city and county managers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2246" /> It is evident that the Bill which is now before this House is a very substantial measure indeed.  However, in the outline which I have just given of its main features, I would not claim to have dealt with any more than the broad headings of the reform provisions.  These powers will, in turn, as I have already indicated, accommodate a wider range of specific matters which can be dealt with in a flexible manner as implementation of the reform programme progresses.  This is in keeping with the need to treat the programme as an evolving one, the elements of which must be built on progressively, and with specific measures being formulated with due regard to the programme as a whole and to its particular stage of implementation.</P>
    <P>The reform programme will open a new era for local government but it will also require new attitudes and approaches on the part of local authorities. The very fact that many of the reforms which have been called for over the years are now being provided will, in a sense, represent a challenge to local authorities and to local authority members.  Local authorities will be compelled to display an even greater sense of responsibility, maturity and self-reliance. The elected members of local authorities will be expected to play the central role which our democratic system always intended that they should.  There will be an onus on them to utilise their enhanced position to the full so as to discharge effectively their duty of representing the interests of their communities and to be more fully accountable to the people for the performance of their councils.</P>
    <P>There will also be new challenges and opportunities for local communities. Among the chief objectives of the reform programme are the need to make the local government system more meaningful and closer to these communities, to make it more responsive to local needs and problems and to foster initiative in communities.  This also implies a greater degree of participation in local government affairs on the part of individuals and groups in the community.  I was extremely heartened to note the results <Col N="2247" /> of a recent survey indicating a high level of public interest in and support for local government.  This is something that was also reflected in the very high volume of submissions made by individuals and groups during the course of last year's review.  It gives grounds for believing that, in the years ahead, a reformed local government system can, with community support and participation, prove to be a very productive force in the local interest and, as a consequence, in the broader national interest.  I think it shows also that we are on the right lines with the reform programme and that those who may have believed that the public attitude towards local government was one of disinterest or even cynicism had given insufficient credit to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Members of this House will have taken note of that message, that the debate on this Bill will be positive and productive and that it will reflect the degree of commitment which is owing from the Oireachtas to the local tier of our democracy.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Bill is taking place four years and two months after the present Minister took up his term of office in the Department of the Environment.  When he took office there was no housing crisis yet fewer people were emigrating then and a major road building programme was in place which the Minister reduced.  There were also very few potholes on our county roads, which now are littered with potholes.  The Minister's record in office is very sad; indeed, not only has he failed utterly in relation to housing and virtually stopped building of all local authority houses but he has also abolished all house improvements grants, including grants for thousands of houses, many of them within walking distance of his plush office, which still have no bathrooms or inside toilets. During his term of office and for the first time in the history of this State we have <Col N="2248" /> had an abortive review of the constituency boundaries because of his attempt to manipulate those boundaries. We heard his very unfortunate comments on radio about our President during the presidential election campaign and we saw also his utter determination to resist the Government reshuffle which would have taken him out of the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>It is with great sadness that I cite this Minister's record because, contrary to what he would have us believe, his tenure in the Custom House has coincided with the run down of local government, less and less discretion is allowed to councils and, therefore, people have less and less influence over local affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not repeat in his speech the allegations which he twice made about me over the weekend, first at the press conference on Friday and second on the RTE news programme on Sunday.  He had tried to convey the impression I had broken some confidence or convention by making a statement on Thursday night on the proposals now before us.  The Chief Whip of the Fine Gael Party is present and can confirm that printed on the back of the copy of the Bill we had received from the acting Government Chief Whip on Thursday, was the following &ldquo;Presented by the Minister for the Environment, 1 May 1991.&rdquo;  Today, the copy of the Bill which all Members of the House received states &ldquo;Presented by the Minister for the Environment 2nd May, 1991&rdquo;; in other words last Thursday.  The Minister knows I was well within my rights to comment on the Bill we were told was being circulated on that day.  I want to express my anger at what the Minister sought to convey &mdash; I cannot use the word lies &mdash; not once but twice that I had somehow broken a confidence or a convention when, in fact, the Minister had broken the convention and had delayed the circulation of the Bill.  The Bill was ready, it states printed on 2 May, yet he delayed circulating it until he had held a press conference at 4 p.m. on Friday, 3 May, which was one day later.  By doing so he thought he would grab the news headlines on Friday <Col N="2249" /> evening and would not be subjected to the rigours of Opposition comment on radio programmes such as the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; or &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; the following day.</P>

      <P>The Minister tried to convey the impression that he had shown me the courtesy of providing me with an advance copy of the Bill.  He showed no such courtesy.  At midday on Thursday last, the Acting Government Chief Whip presented the Opposition Whips with a copy of the Bill which, as I have said, already stated &ldquo;Presented by the Minister on 1 May 1991&rdquo;, 1 May, being the previous day, Wednesday.  There was then no question of confidentiality or no question of us being bound by any convention. In fact, the Acting Government Chief Whip was embarrassed by the lack of notice and at the fact that the Bill had not been circulated.  I want to repeat what was said in the course of the exchanges on the Order of Business, that the explanatory memorandum was circulated only today.  Some Members received the explanatory memorandum only two hours ago.  It will be a long time before I believed the Minister for the Environment again and it is reasonable to say that Members of this House will have similar reservations about the Minister's word.</P>

      <P>The Minister has tried to convey the impression that this Bill in its entirety must be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before 17 May and that it was a difficult pernickety Opposition that was griping about this matter.  The reality, however, is that a small section of the Bill needs to be passed before 17 May to enable the local elections to proceed on time.  I made it clear that last Thursday and on every occasion I have spoken publicly on this matter that, notwithstanding my deep reservations about the postponement of local elections in borough councils, other than Dún Laoghaire, in urban district councils and in town commissions, I was prepared to facilitate the speedy enactment of legislation which would provide for that postponement and the necessary consequential provisions dealing with the onward elections of representatives to vocational educational committees, etc. That is all that needs to be enacted before 17 May.  The Minister could have introduced two Bills, a short Bill that would provide for that enactment and a Bill with more substantive provisions, thereby enabling this House and the Seanad to give due and proper consideration to a major piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not stand up to rigorous consideration.  It is a dangerous Bill. Anyone who knows anything about local government will appreciate the point made by the Barrington Committee that the first requirement of local government reform is to return to local people power and influence over local things, in other words, to give local people power to get rid of that ugly derelict site near their houses, to get that pedestrian crossing that the senior citizens of their town need, to get the street cleaned, to get the road repaired etc.  Our people have been robbed of that influence because of the centralised nature of our local government structures.  The Barrington Committee rightly points out &mdash; and their point of view is reiterated in many other independent studies &mdash; that of the 12 <Col N="2251" /> countries of the EC no country has a more centralised system of local government than this State.  I hope to demonstrate in the course of this debate that this Bill will centralise decision making even further.  It will almost require local authorities to get permission from the Minister in relation to even the colour of the toilet paper they use in their lavatories.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael reject the Government method as much as the Bill.  It is not reasonable for a Minister, after two years and four months in office, to rush in major legislation at the last minute and not provide adequate time for proper analysis and the giving of due care and attention.  Fine Gael reject this Bill as unsafe and unsatisfactory.  It is unsafe because in 29 of its 52 sections the Minister, or in one or two cases that Government, takes on extra powers over local authorities.  In several cases these powers include power to amend or overrule existing laws of this and the Upper House by regulations which may never be debated in the Dáil.  This is Government by <i>fiat,</i> this is Government by Flynn.  It is unsatisfactory because of the shortness of notice as much as the amount of debating time.  It is just not possible, in less than two weeks, for a parliamentary opposition spokesperson to table amendments, undertake the necessary consultations and seek the necessary legal and other advice which is almost always a prerequisite for proper examination of legislation.  This Bill refers to 36 other Acts and seeks to amend 23 other enactments. All of these 36 Acts and 23 other enactments need to be studied.  This takes time.  It is not possible for a parliamentary opposition spokesman to do that in ten days while engaged here in a Second Stage debate.  It is unsatisfactory also, to say the minimum, because it is very doubtful that it will do the most urgent thing necessary in local government reform, that is, return to local people power and influence over local matters. My fear is that local councillors and local people will have less power, and my belief is that the Minister will have more power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2252" /> The Minister may argue that in some of the 29 sections which give him additional powers some are only reserved powers. However, they are extensive and, sooner or later, they are likely to be used.  I will give some examples.  The Minister may make regulations without any prior Dáil approval &mdash; which will almost certainly be never voted on or discussed in the Dáil &mdash; for general purposes or for any particular purpose.  This may relate to all local authorities, to some local authorities or only one local authority.  It may even relate to part of one local authority or parts of different local authorities. They give power to the Minister to give directions for any specific purpose in any specific place or places.  He could, for instance, direct that they should not plant trees in Donnybrook.  That is a serious point, not made in jest.  Under this law the Minister could prohibit a local authority from planting trees in a particular place or could order them to plant trees in another place.</P>

      <P>This is power indeed. The Minister may prescribe matters in which local authorities shall not exercise power or he may lay down conditions on the way in which they do exercise power. The local authorities, regardless of their political majority, must have regard to the policies and objectives of the Government or of any Minister.  Now, a Chathaoirligh, I can well imagine you gracing the Mansion House in Dublin with a Fine Gael-Labour majority in the <Col N="2253" /> City Council having to expouse the policies of the Minister for the Environment. I do not think you will, but this is what is required of you under this legislation. The Minister may specify terms, conditions and restrictions on how any function is discharged.  The Minister may alter the boundary between one local authority and another without (a) abiding by the recommendations of a boundary committee which he himself, solely and without consultation, appoints or (b) even accepting the agreed recommendations of the two local authorities concerned. Let us say there was agreement between Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council to include some land from the county in the city: the Minister can vary that.  That is not an extensive list of the powers the Minister is taking unto himself in this Bill.</P>
      <P>One of the most worrying parts of the Bill is Part VI which raises very serious questions.  Committees of local authorities are a necessary method of conducting the affairs of most local authorities.  Most authorities, as anyone in this House knows, already have several committees.  I want to pause for a moment here to reflect on two matters. The Minister is legislating here for a number of matters.  He is making provision for what already exists.  We will all have heard him saying on radio over the weekend that he already has the power to rig electoral areas in county boroughs and wondering what I was on about.  If he has that power, why is he providing for it in legislation again?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that local authorities have power to set up committees, and we all know that every county and county borough council in the State has committees.  Why then is the Minister legislating in Part VI of this Bill to provide for committees?  This is where the Minister is at his most dangerous. This is why my description of this Bill as dangerous legislation is most justified, as I intend now to explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is new about this Bill is that it <Col N="2254" /> allows a simple majority on the council to delegate, without restriction if it likes, to a committee their full functions in respect of any given area.  For instance, they could delegate to a committee their housing function or their function in respect of a development plan.  One may ask what is new about this, or if we do not have a planning committee and a housing committee on Dublin Corporation, but they are committees set up under existing legislation.  This committee would be set up under this Part of this Bill.  I repeat, the local authority can delegate to a committee, without restriction if they like any of their functions except that of striking the rate.  They can set up any number of committees and can delegate their functions to those committees.</P>
    <P>However, the most worrying aspect of this provision is that it apparently permits a return to the position where a party with a simple majority on a council could appoint to any committee set up under this Bill its own members only, exluding members of other political parties.  This would permit Fianna Fáil to revert to their practice on most local authorities prior to the 1985 Act of excluding other parties from representation on boards and committees where Fianna Fáil have at least a simple majority.  If this analysis is correct, it could place in the hands of one party, without vetting by any other, major and potentially corrupting powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the House may say the Minister is hardly proposing this; I will quote the legislation.  Section 40 (2) provides that committees set up under this Part of the Bill shall be &ldquo;governed by the provisions of this Part and the regulations, and such previous provisions (whether made by or under statute) as may be specified in the regulations applying to that authority and relating to those matters shall cease to have effect as respects that authority&rdquo;.  Here is hidden <Col N="2255" /> power to overrule even existing laws.  As I have said, this is one of the provisions which makes this Bill dangerous.</P>
      <P>If any section will be the subject of amendments, this section and this Part will be.  The Minister is taking onto himself the power by regulation to amend and override legislation which has been already passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and signed by the President. Here, by the backdoor, the Minister is taking this power.  One of the reasons this Bill is being presented in such a rush is to avoid the due care, attention and analysis of this House.  The Minister may make regulations which say that any committee set up under Part VI of the Bill shall not be subjected to the requirements of the relevant sections and Schedules of the 1985 Act.  The Minister said this is power to the people, it is power to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Moreover, while enabling provisions to create regional authorities are not unworthy in principle, here again the Bill concentrates too much power in the Minister's hands and too little to directly elected local authorities.  The ministerial powers go on and on.  The Minister now proposes to take power to issue directions to local authorities in such matters as twinning with local authorities outside the State.  Why does the Minister in the Custom House want to get involved with such symbolic items as twinning between one local authority and another?  Why does he want to have his dead hand involved in almost every action, no matter how insubstantive.  In short the Minister goes too far in centralising power in his own hands.  As I said earlier, even the colour of toilet rolls used by local authorities could, in theory at least be subject to Ministerial direction.  The Minister, Deputy Flynn, cannot be the policeman of the lavatories of the nation. Neither fir nor mná na hÉireann would like that much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local government is about local power over local matters.  Ideally, local people should be able to influence the environmental, planning, housing and recreational matters which arise in their <Col N="2256" /> locality and which can so disturb the peace and tranquility of their lives.  The principle of subsidiarity should be the first rule of local government legislation. That is a principle to which the Minister never once adverted in his very long speech.  The principle of subsidiarity is the principle that all decisions should be made at the most local point possible. This cannot be achieved without reform of local government finance, and on this basic criterion alone this Bill fails.  As long as the Minister, Deputy Flynn, pays the piper he will insist on calling the tune.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his long speech, repeated something the Taoiseach said in the exchanges on the Order of Business, accusing Fine Gael as the party who refused to participate in an all-party committee on local government reform.  We certainly did because from beginning to end the Government proposal was a sham as it excluded the crucial question of local government finance.  No matter what hypothetical role the Minister purports to give to local authorities, the local authorities ultimately are restricted by the fact that they have to take direction from the Minister, especially when the Minister is paying the grant.  The proposal for an all-party committee on local government reform was a sham just as this Bill is in essence a sham.</P>
    <P>Localised decision-making may at first sight conflict with another desirable principle, namely, that of regional co-ordination and development.  The Minister makes provision in section 43 of the Bill for the setting up of regional authorities.  I do not fundamentally disagree with these provisions in the Bill except to say again that the Minister over-involves himself. The Minister's role is too large and the role of the directly and democratically elected county and county borough councils is too small.  The dead hand of the Minister infiltrates everywhere with phrases like &ldquo;the direction of the Minister&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Minister may prescribe&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Minister may, specifically by regulation or order&rdquo; throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill are flawed. Fine Gael will be launching their own <Col N="2257" /> local government policy before the local elections.  Our policy, unlike this Bill, will address some real local government issues.  The Minister did not refer to real local government matters; he did not refer to the potholes which have become the subject of a competition on the most popular radio programme in the country, &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the impact of local government reform on the housing crisis; he did not refer to the impact of his local government reform proposals on those unfortunate people who do not have bathrooms, which includes 6,000 local authority homes and many more thousands of private homes. He did not say how his reform proposals would have an impact on unfortunate mothers of young children living in high rise blocks with lifts which do not work because of cutbacks imposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>He did not say how his local government reform proposals will affect the awful environmental conditions prevailing in so many parts of our cities, many of them within walking distance of his office.  He did not say how his local government reform proposals will address urban dereliction, which is so manifest in our city; he did not refer to how his proposals will affect the question of rural depopulation and ways and means of arresting it.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the Minister's local government reform proposals will have no impact on any of these things even though they all affect people who expect improvements from local government reform.  Nobody should have to live in nightmarish environmental conditions in unkept blocks of flats run badly by local authorities mainly because of lack of commitment by the Minister to refurbishment, maintenance, hygiene and basic standards of human decency.</P>
    <P>We will be happy as a party to place our proposals for local government reform for comparison with this Bill and to allow the people to decide whose proposals are best to improve and maintain the quality of local life throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2258" /> There are parts of the Bill with which I agree or with which I have very little difficulty.  I agree that in the main the behaviour changes imperative of Fianna Fáil councillors in a small number of local authorities has made in relation to section 4 motions dealing with planning matters even though that runs counter to my own strong feeling and instincts that we must return local power to local people. However, we cannot return local power to local people by further reducing the local power of local councillors.  While I welcome the Minister's proposals from a symbolic point of view, he has tried to crack a nut with a sledgehammer.  The implication is that elected representatives are more liable to wrongdoing or &mdash; worse &mdash; influences to wrongdoing than public officials at local or central level. How will the Minister's proposals get to the core of the concerns about corruption in planning procedure?  What in the Minister's proposals gets to the kernel of the problem?</P>
    <P>Local representatives are answerable to local people.  I agree that section 4 motions should not be allowed unless moved by councillors for the area affected.  We know the ruse in Dublin County Council where Fianna Fáil councillors from Malahide moved motions in relation to rezoning in Lucan.  That should not be allowed; only councillors directly answerable to the affected electorate should have the power to move section 4 motions.  I agree with the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the Minister's proposals are inadequate because they do not provide for a consultative role for the local people affected by section 4 motions, material contravention or rezoning motions.  There should be a requirement in legislation to have a public meeting and the local electorate affected should be invited to it to express their views on any section 4 motions in relation to planning, rezoning or material contravention matters.</P>
    <P>There should still be power in the local council to overrule, in given circumstances, the manager or even An Bord Pleanála because at least the public <Col N="2259" /> representatives are accountable to the people of their area.  If that power is taken away, which is effectively what the Minister proposes to do, it means that we will be further reducing the influence and power of local people over their environment. While I do not quarrel with the Minister's objective I quarrel with his <i>modus operandi.</i></P>
    <P>I do not have any difficulties &mdash; although I will have comments and amendments in relation to some of them &mdash; in relation to sections 2, 4, 10, 11 and 13 to 26, inclusive, although I am slightly worried about section 25.  Sections 44 and 45 are subject to what I already said because they deal with section 4 procedures and I may be tabling amendments to the Minister's proposals.  I do not have any difficulty in relation to section 46 which allows councils to entertain or section 47 which provides for similar restrictions on the length of the term of office of county managers as is the case at present for departmental secretaries.  I also do not have any difficulties in relation to section 48 which provides for the granting of civic honours &mdash; although one part repeals the present powers available to certain county boroughs; the same applies to section 49 on twinning even though I think the Minister should mind his own business and keep out of it.  I also do not have a difficulty in regard to section 50 regarding annual reports of local authorities.  The same applies to section 52 (1).  Indeed, I welcome some of those sections and I will come back to them in a moment.</P>
    <P>I have some difficulties in relation to section 1 (10).  I also have some difficulties with sections 5 to 9, inclusive, which purport to give new functions to local authorities which, in reality, is only giving expression to what local authorities already do, they have that broad representational role to which the Minister referred.  However, the Minister then goes on to take the power &mdash; the sting in the tail &mdash; to direct and restrict local authorities in that broad representational role.  This, again, is evidence of the dead hand of the Minister in the Bill.  They <Col N="2260" /> cannot talk about condoms or the GAA. I think section 9 gives the Minister the power to restrict the powers which local authorities already have.</P>
    <P>I have some difficulties with sections 27 to 35 which deal with changes in boundaries.  I want to deal briefly with this issue.  I broadly welcome the Minister's proposals in regard to the changing of boundaries as between local authorities. Some people get confused about the boundaries of the functional area of an authority and the boundaries of local electoral areas within authorities.  I welcome the Minister's proposals, which are much better than the existing ones, in regard to the making of arrangements as to the swapping of territory between two neighbouring local authorities.  His proposals in this regard are much better than the existing arrangements.  However, the Minister is yet again intruding too much. He is giving himself the power to override the boundary committees.  He is also giving himself the power to override even an agreed transfer between the two local authorities concerned.  Why does the Minister want to have his finger in every pie?</P>
    <P>Section 42 will give the Minister and the Minister for Finance power to decide effectively on the amount of remuneration for a chairman of an authority. While the Bill will do this under the guise of enabling local authorities to pay an allowance to their chairperson, I want to point out that many authorities already do this in practice.  As the Minister may know, I was Lord Mayor of Dublin 15 years ago and I was paid an allowance. Under this Bill the Minister will have the power to say to the local authority, &ldquo;you cannot pay the Lord Mayor that much&rdquo;. Why does the Minister want that power?</P>

      <P>I have some reservations about section 51.  I would bet my life on it that, like other councillors, Fianna Fáil councillors have some concerns about section 51 which will allow the Minister to dictate the limit of expenses paid to councillors.  I have no doubt that over the years some councillors have abused this system but the reality is that the vast majority of them have to incur enormous personal expenses as members of local councils. For example, they do not have free post and do not receive a telephone allowance in most cases, or a travelling allowance in some cases.  Most councillors have to take time off work to represent people at committee and council meetings at enormous cost to themselves.  Yet, again, the Minister is intruding in an area he should keep out of.  He wants to control everything. The amount of abuse in this area is negligible compared to the overall situation and I believe local authorities should be able to deal with that abuse.</P>
      <P>I am not sure I agree with the provision which will enable the Minister to set the limit or provide an overall figure for expenses for councillors.  Although it is not clear, the inference I draw from that section is that whether or not one attends council or committee meeting one will get paid.  The Minister should clarify this provision as that is an inference which can be drawn from the section as it is currently drafted.  The Minister is again intruding in an area in which he would be wise not to intrude.  If they are to discharge their representational duties properly, councillors in every local authority deserve more consideration and help than they are getting at present.</P>
      <P>I have some slight reservations about section 54 which provides that the Minister may institute an inquiry into a local authority and impose on that local authority the cost of the inquiry even though that local authority may have no say in the inquiry or how it is run.  The dead hand of the Minister can be seen in every section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2262" /> Those are my minor reservations about the Bill.  I want to refer to my major difficulties with it.  Over the weekend I carried out as much research as I possibly could and also had consultations.  I have serious reservations about section 3.  I also have serious reservations about section 12 which deals with the arranging of local electoral areas in county boroughs. Regardless of whether the Minister has that power already, I consider that these are not wise powers.  Under section 12 the Minister may decide &mdash; I think he said in his speech that he will not do this before the June local elections &mdash; on the shape and the boundaries of local electoral areas in every county borough and on the number of councillors for each such electoral area and the number of aldermen.  In addition, he will not have to have any regard to proportionality. For example, the Minister may decide that there should be five councils in an area where there are 10,000 people and three councils in an area where there are 20,000 people.  It will be possible, in theory, for the Minister to do that under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued over the weekend that the Bill would merely re-enact powers which he already has.  I am not convinced about this, just as I am not convinced about why he should provide powers for committees when most local authorities already have committees. Why is the Minister re-enacting powers which he already has?  Why has he not taken the opportunity to insert a requirement of proportionality, proportional representation, which is the very basis of our form of democracy?  There is no requirement on the Minister to be proportional. Indeed, the representation in some of our county boroughs is not porportional. I will be tabling amendments to section 12.</P>
    <P>Over the weekend the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, ran to the defence of the Minister for the Environment. He said, among other things, that I had misread the Bill.  I had the good fortune to be on a radio show with him at lunch time today during which he repeated that claim and went on to give <Col N="2263" /> a misrreading of the Bill, which I had the opportunity to put right.  The Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, said that the Minister for the Environment would have to consult a boundary committee about local electoral areas within county boroughs and that he would have to have the approval of the Dáil.  The Bill states that the Minister may consult the boundary committee, not that the Minister shall consult the boundary committee.  The Minister is not obliged to consult the boundary committee.  On the radio I forced a concession from the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, to accept an amendment from &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I hope that when we reach Committee Stage the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, will live up to Deputy Molloy's promise because Deputy Molloy had been misreading the Bill, having accused me of misreading it.</P>
    <P>I will be substituting proposals to the effect that the number of seats in each electoral area will not allow an unfair advantage to any political party.  Section 12 will be the subject of major amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about the Bill, particularly about sections 36 to 40. On my reading of it, and having received detailed legal advice, these sections allow the Minister to overrule the <i>pro rata</i> requirement of the 1985 Act, by regulation. We will return to a situation in which one party with a majority can appoint only members of their party to committees and then delegate very significant powers to them.  As a result the elected council would not have a say in those matters and decisions could be made in private without being analysed by the opposition on that council.  When the Minister replies to these points on Friday I hope he will assure me that he will accept the necessary amendments to avoid doubt in this respect.</P>
    <P>I have major reservations about section 43 which provides for the creation of regional authorities.  The Minister glossed over this in his speech.  Under the Bill regional authorities, which will not be directly elected by the people, can be <Col N="2264" /> assigned functions with a large ministerial involvement and then the directly elected local authorities can be levied to pay for those decisions by the regional authorities. Local authorities, already strapped for cash, have limited ways of raising money.  I do not disagree with the principle of regional authorities.  The Fine Gael proposals, which will be published before the local elections, will have provisions in relation to regional authorities but they will not be like the crass proposals of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the regions suggested by the Minister.  To put Wicklow, Meath and Kildare with Dublin is to constitute a far too complex region which does not correspond with an existing region of any authority.  I know that there are health board regions, IDA regions and so on and that an attempt is being made to correlate those regions.  The Barrington Committee wanted to make things simple and suggested that we should create institutions and areas which people can readily identify.  If their wish is to be fulfilled surely the basis for any future regional organisations should be the Euro constituencies.  Should not the regional authorities relate to Brussels on some matters?  Yet the Minister is proposing a region comprising Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.</P>

      <P>Meath is not in the Eastern Health Board Region.  It will mean taking it from the North-Eastern Health Board Region.  Meath, Wicklow and Kildare are in the Leinster Euro constituency. Dublin already has one-third of the State's population and now the Minister is proposing to add another 300,000 people into the Dublin region. That will mean that about 40 per cent of the population of the State will be in one region.  That does not make sense.  I agree with the need for regional representation but I disagree with what the Minister is proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have any problem with section 52 (1) but I have serious problems with section 52 (2) and (3).  Those provisions <Col N="2265" /> will allow the Minister by regulation which may never come before the House to change statute law.  Section 52 (2) states:</P>
    <P>(2) Where it appears to the Minister&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of remedying an inconsistency between a provision of an enactment and this Act, or</P>
    <P>(b)  to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of enabling such a provision to have effect in conformity with this Act, </P>
    <P>the Minister may in relation to such a provision by regulations provide for&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  its application with any modification or adaptation specified in the regulations,</P>
    <P>(ii)  its amendment otherwise or its repeal, revocation or termination. </P>
    <P>We ought not give the Minister those powers even if under a positive order the Minister must come into the House to have it approved.  In all other cases I referred to the Minister need not come into the House.  If precedent is to be followed, even if a motion is tabled by the Opposition under the 21 day rule to reject regulations, it is up to the Government to order business and the Government can simply refuse to order a motion rejecting a regulation, as they did before.</P>
    <P>This is a hasty Bill.  It is not good enough to expect this House to deal with it in two weeks.  I am not saying that the length of debating time is not enough, but that the notice is too short.  The Opposition spokesmen will certainly be confined to this House for the rest of this week and when can they sit with their advisers to analyse the Bill and come up with suggested improvements, if Committee Stage is to be taken on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week?  It is not good enough that the Government should seek to rush legislation like this through the Houses on the pretext that it must be enacted by 17 May.  Only two or three sections of the Bill need to be <Col N="2266" /> enacted by 17 May.  Even though we do not necessarily agree with the Government on the postponement of local elections, we would have been prepared to facilitate that to allow for the deferment of the consequential provisions.  This is rushed legislation.  It is dangerous legislation which needs most careful consideration.</P>
    <P>This party will resist the Bill and will, if time allows, table extensive amendments to the sections I have indicated. Let me suggest, in conclusion, that the Minister might redeem his hand somewhat by showing a willingness to accept some of the amendments to be proposed by this side of the House.</P>

      <P>the undemocratic and incompetent arrangements proposed by the Government for the debating of the Bill; and</P>
      <P>the failure of the Bill to deal effectively with the crisis in local services, including housing, roads and local financing;</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never before have I witnessed circumstances where the Government refused to supply, at the time of publication, an explanatory memorandum to complex and wide-ranging legislation.  I share the anger of other Opposition spokespersons who had their first sight of the Bill last Thursday at the Whips' meeting when they were handed a draft by the acting Government Whip who was, as other people have said, apologetic and indicated <Col N="2267" /> that he had just got it.  When questioned about an explanatory memorandum, his officials did not know the answer and said they had only just caught sight of the Bill and were trying to make arrangements for taking it.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to the Minister that the previous week, the Whips discussed and reached agreement on the business to be taken this week and no reference was made to the Local Government Bill.  If, as the Minister said in his speech today, the Bill was in gestation for some months, why was a version of it only made available on Thursday and then circulated on Friday, when Members had left Leinster House, with the result that most of them only had their first sight of the Bill yesterday?  The explanatory memorandum was circulated only this morning.  This is a wideranging Bill which has taken a long time to prepare, which has attracted a great deal of outside interest and will affect many aspects of local government; yet, the Minister and the Government insist that it must pass all Stages before we have had adequate time to reflect on its implications or the framework within which local government will work for decades to come.  That is a bad way to do business and, as I said, even Government spokesmen, at the end of last week, were very sheepish and apologetic.  To put it at its mildest, this is a recipe for bad law and we can be absolutely certain that the Bill has ramifications which are not yet apparent.</P>
    <P>The process of examination of legislation has been designed to ensure that the legislation passed by these Houses is as good as it can be.  If this process is to have any meaning both sides of the House, including Government back-benchers need to reflect adequately on legislation which will impinge on the lives of every citizen.  The arrangements proposed by the Minister for taking the Bill and insisted upon today through a guillotine motion are totally undemocratic and run counter to the spirit in which legislation is passed through the Houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2268" /> This House is more than a decision-making body.  It has been designed as a representative deliberative assembly where the interests of minorities, as well as the interests of the majority, can be effectively represented.  Regardless of how annoying it might be for the Minister and the Government, Members have been sent here by the people to carry out their duties and functions and they do this not only when they vote but also when they speak.  The Standing Orders of this House have been drafted in such a way as to ensure that every single Member, irrespective of whether they are a member of a party, has the democratic right to speak on every provision before the House and to ensure that the Ceann Comhairle cannot accept a motion to close a debate if it appears to him that that motion would infringe on the rights of the minority or individual Members of the House.  Each time the Government introduce a guillotine motion the Standing Orders of the House, which have been designed to prevent such pre-emptive action, have to be set aside, and we witnessed that awful spectacle once again today.  On such occasions Standing Orders of the House which have been carefully thought out and which were intended to facilitate constructive debate are simply laid aside by the force of numbers on the Government benches.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time that the Government have used such tactics.  They used them at the end of last June on a range of measures, including one dealing with broadcasting.  At that time I said that their behaviour was a good illustration of Fianna Fáil's contempt for parliamentary democracy.  It was also a fair reflection of the hypocrisy of the other party in Government who it is alleged desire Dáil reform.  That comment holds good again today.  Indeed, their hypocrisy is all the more pronounced on this Bill.  After all, this is supposed to be a Bill dealing with local democracy.  Even the most partisan Government supporter must be prepared to reflect on the deep irony of a Bill being rammed through the Oireachtas, in a most undemocratic way, in a matter of <Col N="2269" /> days and the Government riding roughshod over the rules which we ourselves set down to govern debate.  Even the promoters of the Bill must feel that this runs counter to the essence of democracy. How can such a measure be seen to reinvigorate local democracy in any way?</P>
    <P>If this Bill dealt with the powers of the courts or was introduced following a terrorist outrage one might be forgiven for accepting that it was an emergency measure, but it is alleged to be a Bill dealing with democracy.  One is being dishonest therefore in arguing that it is an emergency measure or that the matter is so urgent that the Bill had to be parachuted in on Friday and has to be enacted within ten days.  All the elements of the Bill need to be examined in detail.  That is what we have been sent here to do.  If we accept the Minister's timetable and his view that some of the local government elections must take place on June 27, there is only one part of the Bill which needs to be enacted between now and 17 May and that is Part III dealing with the postponement of elections in some authorities, the consequent extension of the life of some subcounty structures and the debarment of Ministers and Ministers of State from participation in local authorities. That fact was accepted by the Minister, so the rest is cobbled together and forced through under the pretext of urgency.  When this sort of thing happens every democrat has cause to worry and we have cause to ask one question: what is the hidden agenda?</P>
    <P>There is no good reason that this Bill has to be forced through the Dáil in the way this Government are setting about it.  By any objective standards it would be a better Bill if the Minister allowed adequate time for debate, reasonable time for reflection, and if there was openness with the Opposition parties.  No Member of this House, no party and no committee have a monopoly on wisdom.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in many Bills in this House in the last few years and the best legislation came after we had open consultation, ample time for reflection and a Minister who was open to listen to another point of view.  For example, the <Col N="2270" /> Child Care Bill took a very long time to pass through this House, but we had a Minister who said he was not monopolising the amendments to be tabled or the understandings to be enacted into law.  He wanted the views of the country; we sought them from every agency and every individual involved in the child care area and we put together one of the best pieces of legislation to go through this House.  Local government reform is no less complicated, no less important and also involves all the community.  There are many experts who want an input into this Bill.  There are many people whose comments and contributions would be of immense value but often they are simply ignored because the Minister has set himself a timetable, and is determined that it go through at all costs.  We have had a few days to do some analysis on this Bill, and it is totally inadequate to be a framework for local democracy for decades to come.  Unfortunately, it is not the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat way to involve all the people.  If they succeed in ramming this Bill through they will be telling the electorate that it represents a promise kept, the most systematic &mdash; I can hear the word echoing now &mdash; and profound reform of local government in the history of the State.  I can hear the hyperbole ringing around the country from the backs of lorries as they canvass votes heading up to 27 June.</P>
    <P>This Bill will, no doubt, be sold as the solution to all local government problems; all the difficulties will be solved in one stroke.  Of course, it would not be possible to make that claim if this Bill was fully understood by the electorate.  It does not solve the fundamental problems of local government.  In fact, it barely sets out to address them.  It does not provide a penny by way of extra resources, build an extra house or fill an extra pothole.  In fact, it establishes a set of empty and meaningless principles, important principles but empty and meaningless, because the two parties responsible for this Bill in the last number of years have contrived between them to bring local government to its knees and to make local government a hollow concept.  That <Col N="2271" /> has been accepted even by many Government spokesmen in recent times.  I hope when this electoral team get on the hustings and talk about this Bill in the glorious terms I have described as a promise fulfilled, the people will remember that this is the same team who made them all those promises in 1985.</P>
    <P>It is fitting that the present Minister for Energy has been to the forefront in recent days defending his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, and this legislation, since it was he in his pre-Progressive Democrat incarnation who was the principal architect of the 1985 promises.</P>
    <P>I intend to return to that era later in my contribution, but first I feel I must say a few words about the principles of this Bill and the way in which they are going to be dealt with.  I said detailed analysis of this Bill has not been made easier for any Member by the method of its introduction and the scheduling of its taking, but one thing is clear: the Government in drafting the Bill are giving with one hand and taking away with the other. All the experts &mdash; there have been a number over the years as the Minister will know &mdash; who have examined local government and the whole concept of local democracy have expressed a range of views all broadly committed to the notion of spreading outwards and downwards and empowering and enabling local communities to have control over their own affairs.  These views have tended to be crystallised in an argument about two major and important principles which fundamentally affect local government, the doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i> and the principle of subsidiarity.  Both these central principles raise their heads in this Bill and I will refer to them in turn.</P>
    <P>In our initial comment on this Bill on Friday, we said the inclusion of the utterly banal clause &mdash; and I quote from the blurb &mdash; that &ldquo;a local authority may represent the interests of the local community in such manner as it thinks appropriate&rdquo; sums up the attitude of this Government and what Deputy Molloy only last week called the charade of local <Col N="2272" /> government.  The Labour Party went on to say it is clear that the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Coalition are determined to perpetuate this charade and have no intention of fundamental reform despite the smoke screens that have come from the Custom House in the last few days.  Last weekend the Minister for the Environment referred to this clause and the way it is elaborated in the Bill as a significant widening of what is known as the <i>ultra vires</i> rule affecting local government.  Under the existing <i>ultra vires</i> rule, local government is limited by the statutes which regulate it and can extend no further to act in any way other than what is specifically prescribed by statute.  Everybody has long recognised that that was and is an impossible limitation on local government.  It stifled real development.  It stifled imaginative councils and imaginative management from involving the potential of community to solve the range of problems, and that stifling force has long been targeted as something that needed to be removed.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is the view of the Labour Party that this is a very important and significant item of Private Members' legislation, the fundamental aim of which is to increase the level of public awareness and accountability in relation to standards applicable to the holding of public office generally.  I intend to deal with all aspects of the Bill in some detail but first I will summarise the main features.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeking the support of the Dáil for the principle of this legislation.  There will be many views in relation to the specifics but there are a few core principles which we want to enact into law and we will welcome the support of all <Col N="2273" /> Opposition parties.  Should we be successful in obtaining a Second Reading for this Bill, we would welcome comments, advice and suggestions from all parties and from Government members who wish to improve the Bill.  We want to set before the Dáil a fundamental set of principles which will reform standards in Government and public life.</P>
    <P>The first part of the Bill deals with gifts made and services provided to the holders of certain public offices, principally members of the Government, Ministers of State or the Attorney General. Under our Bill any gift worth more than £200 made to such an office holder by virtue of his office will become the property of the State.  At present the practice is that no matter how valuable a gift is it remains for all time the property of the individual who receives it.  There is a tradition whereby Presidents of Ireland bequeath to the people gifts given to them as a consequence of their office, but no other office holder is bound by tradition to act in like manner.  Our Bill provides that the receipt of all gifts must be reported to the Secretary of the Government who will determine their value. Office holders who wish to claim that the gift was made to them in a personal capacity and not by virtue of their office may make a case and argue that case before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that it will be an offence for an office holder to fail to report a gift or to provide misleading information.  The Bill also makes it an offence for any office holder to solicit or accept the provision of goods or services at a price less than the commercial value. The penalties for these offences range up to £10,000 in fines or two years in jail on conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Part II of this Bill provides for the establishment of a register of the financial and other interests of Members of Dáil and Seanad Éireann.  These registers will be public documents available for inspection. It will be compulsory for every Member of either House to complete this register.  Interests which must be reported include the Member's own <Col N="2274" /> interests and those of his or her spouse and children.  It is a matter of amazement that the requirement exists for members of local authorities.  They are required to make a declaration of interests when dealing with aspects of local government which would impinge on their own affairs.  No such requirement exists for Members of this House or Members of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>The matters which must be reported include company shareholdings, beneficial trusts, ownership of land, company directorships, partnerships, liabilities exceeding £1,000 in value, bonds and similar investments, savings accounts, assets &mdash; excluding household and personal effects &mdash; worth more than £5,000, any other sources of income of more than £500 per annum, gifts worth more than £200, subsidised goods or services, membership of any organisation, any positions held as a consultant or as an adviser and any other interests where a conflict of interest with a Member's public duties could foreseeably be seen to arise.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it clear that a Member need not set out the monetary value of any item on the register.  The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that potential conflicts of interest are made public but not necessarily the details of the total wealth of individual Members of the Oireachtas. Members who fail or refuse to complete the register may be suspended from the services of the Dáil or Seanad for a period on the recommendation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the income of political parties, a timely issue coming up to another series of elections. The provisions make it compulsory for political parties to publish their income and expenditure, a practice currently not engaged in by every political party, and to include the identity of any donor who makes a donation in excess of £1,000 in any one year for the benefit of an individual political party.  Where a gift is made to a political party for the use of the national party or any local or subordinate organisation of the party or for the purposes of supporting the election of candidates, every person who makes such a <Col N="2275" /> gift must identify the name and address of the person or body on whose behalf the gift is made.  It will be an offence for any person to fail to comply with this section.  The Bill requires identified agents of each political party to prepare and submit a return of the party's receipts and expenses and to include in that return any gifts worth more than £1,000 which were made for the use of the party or candidates of the party.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Parliamentary Labour Party have decided to allocate their scarce and precious Private Members' time to this Bill, especially given the fact that this is probably our last chance of Private Members' time in this session, such is the division between the Opposition parties.  It is hoped that this Bill will generate a high degree of public and media debate about this crucial subject.  There is a great deal of talk about the need for Dáil reform.  In our view the most important and necessary reform is to ensure that politicians and political parties are as accountable as possible to the public and to the electorate they serve.  Above all else, a greater sense of accountability and transparency is in the interests of all politicians, in the interests of the people and of the institution of democracy.</P>
    <P>In Thatcherite Britain and in Reaganite America the issues we are raising are commonplace.  Legislators in the House of Commons compile a detailed register of their financial interests and in the United States legislators have been sent to jail for breaches in the ethical requirements of membership of Congress.  Here the truth is &mdash; and it may be a truth that we do not want to confront &mdash; that almost any conflict of interest is possible without the general public knowing.</P>
    <P>Conflict of interest could involve individuals or whole political parties but the bottom line is that secrecy is still possible no matter how undesirable that may be. That is the dilemma and the shadow on democracy that this Bill seeks to remove. Frankly, I do not believe it is necessary to make a detailed argument in favour of the principles enshrined in this Bill.  This <Col N="2276" /> is a principle that is long accepted in most democracies, a principle that finally we will accept and, hopefully, we can do so sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of years we have debated many issues in this House: The Goodman affair, the principle of privatisation, broadcasting, the collapse of the Gallagher bank, the purchase of Carysfort, the refurbishment of the Temple Bar area which was discussed today, the Custom House Docks site and the Finance Bill.  They are just examples of fundamental issues addressed in this House in recent years.  All the issues I mentioned have one thing in common, they all involve sensitive commercial decisions and they all involve powerful interests outside this House, powerful financial interests and individuals.  In other words, we are making decisions, virtually on a daily basis, which can affect the economic interests of a wide range of groups and of many individuals.  The potential, therefore, for corruption in that situation is immense.  I am not implying that there is corruption in our political system but I believe very strongly that there have been many situations in the past, including some of those I have mentioned, where the political system and, more importantly, the citizens who elect us, would have benefited greatly from the fullest possible transparency, accountability and understanding of all the financial implications and issues involved.  We have nothing to fear from such transparency.  We have nothing to fear from further accountability.  It is only those who have something to hide who will oppose the principles.</P>
    <P>The political system as a whole can only be strengthened if the cynicism which is inherent in the attitude of so many people outside this House to politics and to politicians is to be removed. A clear assertion by every Member of this and the other House that we could welcome more openness, more accountability and more transparency would be a very significant step in that direction. That is the proposition the Labour Party are setting before this House tonight.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the Bill in a <Col N="2277" /> little more detail.  In Part I we seek to ensure that gifts made and goods and services provided to holders of certain public offices are not seen to be in any way linked to buying favours.  The Bill deals with gifts made to holders of certain public offices and also with the provision of certain services and goods to office holders.  The office holders in question are Ministers, Ministers of State and the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>From the date of coming into operation of this Bill any gift, the value of which exceeds £200, made to an office holder by virtue of his or her office, may be deemed to be a gift to the State.  A gift is defined as being made to an office holder unless it is made by a personal friend or member of the family of that office holder or of his or her spouse and for purely personal reasons.  Where a gift is made to an office holder which he or she knows or has reason to believe may exceed £200 in value that Minister, or that person, must within 30 days report that fact either to the Secretary of the Government or to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The Attorney General, under the provisions of this Bill, is required to report such gifts to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Priviliges.  The office holder should report directly to the Secretary if he or she accepts that gift which was made by virtue of his or her office.  If he or she claims that it was made in a purely personal capacity, he or she is required to report to the appropriate committee of the House and make that case and the final determination will be made by them.</P>
    <P>Where the making of a gift to an office holder is reported to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges they are required, under the provisions of this Bill, to arrive at a decision within 30 days as to whether the gift should be considered to be a personal gift and to be retained by the office holder, or, is an official gift and is to be the property of the State.  An office holder who has received a gift, the value of which he or she knows or suspects to be over the prescribed limit, and who knowingly fails to make the notification in the prescribed <Col N="2278" /> way and within the prescribed time, or who knowingly provides false or misleading information either to the Secretary or to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in connection with that gift, will be guilty of an offence.  When the Secretary to the Government receives notification either from the office holder directly or, from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of either House, he or she shall proceed to ascertain the value of that gift in such manner and in such means as he or she thinks fit, including appointing a valuer.  If the Secretary is of the opinion that the value of the gift exceeds the statutory limit of £200 he or she must inform the Government and the gift will be vested, therefore, in the Minister for Finance on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>An office holder may agree to pay to the Minister for Finance the amount by which the value of the gift exceeds £200 and, in those circumstances, the Government may refuse to accept the gift and on the payment being made, the gift vests in the office holder directly.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill deals also with the making of gifts to office holders by way of providing goods and services at subsidised rates or free of charge.  An office holder who solicits or attempts to accept the provision of goods or services for himself or for his spouse, and if he has reason to believe that the commercial price has been reduced greatly for his benefit, would be obliged to give notice under this section.  The Bill requires the Government to lay an annual report before the Dáil and Seanad setting out the particulars of decisions made under the section within the preceding year by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Secretary to the Government and the Government.  As a document laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas it will be the subject of public scrutiny. They, in essence, are the technical procedures we put down to achieve a very simple and straightforward aim.</P>
    <P>Our object is to bring us into line with the rest of civilised democracies where large gifts simply cannot be accepted by <Col N="2279" /> office holders without reference to anybody. In recent years we have seen gifts of immense value &mdash; or purported to have immense value &mdash; being given to individuals. It is right and proper that we should fall into line with most other countries. It would be improper for any office holder to accept massive expensive gifts by virtue of their office.  It is a simple straightforward principle and it is the principle we are putting before the House tonight.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill concerns the registration of interests of Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  Again, this is a very important principle on which we are out of line even with local government members.  This part requires newly elected Members of each House within 28 days of signing the roll of Members to provide to the Clerk of the Dáil or Seanad, as appropriate, a statement of his or her registrable interests.  He or she must provide a statement of any alteration in relation to those registrable interests within 28 days of that alteration occurring.</P>
    <P>The statement of registrable interests must be in a form prescribed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and must include all interests of which the individual Member is aware.  He or she must include their own interests as well as the interests of his or her spouse and children.  The following items would be registrable under the section: company shareholdings, family or business trusts in which a beneficial interest is held, ownership of lands, company directorships, partnerships, liabilities exceeding £1,000 in value, bonds, debentures and similar investments, savings or investment accounts, the nature of any other asset each valued over £5,000, the nature of any other source of income in excess of £500 per year, gifts valued at more than £200 other than gifts received in a purely personal capacity, goods or services provided free of charge or at a price less than their commercial value other than those provided by way of a gift in a purely private capacity or those which would be valued at less than £200.  Membership of <Col N="2280" /> any organisation would be registrable as would the position of political consultant which is becoming popular now and, perhaps, there are Members who are on a retainer from companies or organisations, and any other interests, where a conflict of interests with a Member's public duties could foreseeably be seen to arise or may possibly arise.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it clear that a Member need not set out the amount or monetary value of his property, of his income or of his benefits.  Our objective is not to lay down in some public register the total wealth of individual Members of this House but to have transparency so that we know where somebody is connected, if there is a possible conflict of interest in an issue coming before this House or a committee of this House and the financial affairs of the members of that committee or the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The Clerks of the Houses of the Oireachtas would be required to maintain registers of Members' interests consisting of every statement of registrable interests provided to them under the provisions of section 12 of this Bill.  Following upon every general election, the Clerks must lay before each House of the Oireachtas a copy of the appropriate completed registration form.  They must also lay before the Dáil and Seanad from time to time as required any notification by a Member of an alteration of his or her interests.</P>
    <P>Where the Committee report to the Dáil or Seanad that a Member has knowingly failed to provide a statement of registerable interests within the prescribed time, has knowingly failed to provide the Clerk with any information of alteration of those interests within the prescribed time, has knowingly provided false or misleading information to the Clerk or knowingly has failed to provide the Committee with all the information and assistance necessary for the purpose of investigating a complaint, the Member may be suspended from the services of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Suspension of a Member from the services of the House under this section continues for 12 sitting days after the Committee report <Col N="2281" /> that the Member in question is no longer in default of his or her obligations under this Bill.  A suspended Member is not entitled under the provisions of this Bill to serve on any select or special committee of the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    <P>The third issue dealt with in this legislation, the third principle that the Labour Party seek support on is the register of income and expenditure of political parties, which is particularly appropriate and suitable to the times we live in, as we approach yet another election.  It is of great interest to the general public when they see fortunes being spent on election campaigns to find out where the money is coming from.  In my view the electorate have the right to know who is paying the piper so that they can make a proper evaluation of the work of political parties here.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for the publication and registration of the income and expenditure of political parties to include the publication of the identity of those who make donations in excess of £1,000 in any one year to any individual party.  That is a reasonable requirement.  It is reasonable for the public to know if any person, or company, is making contributions in excess of £1,000 to the benefit of a political party.</P>
    <P>The Clerk of the Dáil should be the registrar of all political parties.  This is an office which he or she already holds under section 13 of the Electoral Act, 1963. Under that section registration of a political party is voluntary and its only consequence is that a registered party are entitled to have the name of the party appear on a ballot paper at Dáil elections. Section 13 of the 1963 Act will be repealed by this provision and replaced in this Bill by Part III.</P>
    <P>Our Bill requires the registrar to prepare and maintain the register of political parties in which he or she must register every political party, which is in his or her opinion a genuine political party organised to contest an election or elections within the State.  He or she must enter in the register in respect of every registered party, all particulars which are <Col N="2282" /> required to be reported to him or her under this provision.  As soon as practicable after the coming into force of this Bill, and twice yearly thereafter, the registrar is required to lay before the Dáil an extract from the register setting out all particulars which were reported to him or her under this Part in the preceding six months.  An appeal against any decision of the registrar in relation to the registration of any party may be made to the High Court.</P>
    <P>In this Part, the Bill provides that every registered party must within 30 days of this Bill coming into force or within 30 days of the party becoming a registered party, whichever is the later, report the following information to the registrar: the name of the Leader of the party, the address of the headquarters of the party, the name or names of the officer or officers of the party authorised to sign certificates authenticating the candidates of that party, their normal fiscal period, the name and address of their financial secretary, the name and address of their agents appointed by the party and the name and address of their auditor.  Under this Bill a financial secretary of a party is entitled to appoint a person or persons to act as agents for that party.  If appointed, an agent shares certain duties which are assigned to the financial secretary by the Bill in relation to the receipt of donations.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of this Bill applies to any gift made, (a) for the use of the national organisation of a registered party, (b) for the use of any local or subordinate organisation of members of a registered party, for example, a constituency youth organisation or women's organisation, and (c) for the purpose of promoting the election of any candidate of a registered party, the value of which exceeds £1,000. &ldquo;Gift&rdquo; is defined as including the donation of money, goods or services and also the provision of goods or services at a price which is less than the commercial value.</P>
    <P>Every person who makes a gift as defined under section 22 will either make that gift in his or her own behalf out of moneys or property which he or she is <Col N="2283" /> entitled to, or give notice in writing to an agent of the party of the name and address of the person on whose behalf the gift is given.  He or she must also make the gift &mdash; or, in the case of goods or services, give notice in writing of the fact that such gift has been made &mdash; to the agent of that party and a person who fails to comply with the provisions of this section is guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires agents to maintain a record of all gifts made or notified to him under section 22 setting out, (a) the purpose for which the gift is made, (b) the name of the person who made the gift or on whose behalf the gift is made and (c) the date on which it is made.  The records maintained under this section are to be made available to the financial secretary and the auditor of the party.  An agent who maintains a record of which he or she knows or ought reasonably to know contains false or misleading information or who fails to make a record containing substantially the information required is guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>In essence, there are three fundamental principles laid out in this Bill which will bring an element of transparency and accountability and openness into the affairs of national politics in this country which does no exist at present and which is considered to be the norm in most democracies and in most developed countries.</P>
    <P>It is not some radical notion or radical rush of blood that motivates this Bill.  It is a genuine response to a disquiet that exists among the general public in relation to national affairs.  Members of this House may find cause to disagree with the specifics laid out.  They may feel that the limit imposed on gifts to office holders is too stringent or the mechanism too cumbersome or the monitoring too difficult or awkward.  If that is the case, we would welcome contributions to that effect and in particular we would welcome amendments.  What we substantially want is to set before the political parties represented in this House three fundamental principles.</P>
    <P>If we accept these three fundamental <Col N="2284" /> principles we can accept this Bill at Second Stage.  The first principle is that it is wrong, immoral and generally unacceptable for office holders to receive substantial gifts in a personal capacity by virtue of their office.  The second principle is that it is right and proper that there would be a register of the financial dealings and interests of each Member of the Oireachtas so that the public would be aware should any potential conflict of interest arise.  It would mean that when somebody gets up to argue a case here and there is any financial benefit accruing to them from the passing of legislation, etc., the public would be aware of it. The public have a right to know and the Labour Party are asking this House to agree to that.  The third principle is that of accountability in relation to the funding of political parties.  It is a cause of serious scandal in the country when fabulous sums of money are expended on election campaigns which, in essence, is to buy votes.  In the most open-market, <i>laisez faire</i> economy in the world, the US, there are limits on what can be expended on elections to public office. We have no limits here.  A candidate can pump in as much money as he can get his hands on, as much money as is needed, even if it bankrupts the party that puts up the &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; sign at its general headquarters.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the public demand that large scale contributions to political parties should be made public, and I think most people accept that contributions in excess of £1,000 are not insignificant. There is an argument for the State funding of political parties.  It is something that I personally would agree with but it is separate from this Bill.  Until we get to that position, which is accepted in many democracies, what we need is transparency and public accountability in relation to the current situation where sizeable sums of money can be paid over to political parties or individual candidates without public knowledge and public scrutiny, with people left to draw their own conclusions on the effect that contribution, gift or service has on the <Col N="2285" /> operation of the elected member or the performance of the political party.</P>
    <P>It is in all our interests that we remove every shadow of suspicion, every taint of contamination because when suspicion rests on one Member of this House it contaminates us all.  I ask this House to accept the three principles I have enunciated which have broad support among the electorate and in the community.  I hope all the Opposition parties will see their way to supporting this Bill and that the Government themselves might see fit to accept the principles and, if they cannot accept all the detail outlined in the Bill, incorporate the principles in Government legislation in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I have to say that the Government do not think the introduction of legislation to deal with the topics referred to in this Bill is either necessary or appropriate.  It also considers that one of the items covered, the registration of Members' financial interests, is a matter which could more appropriately be dealt with in the context of House rules and procedures rather than on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>I hear Deputy Howlin tut-tutting.  The introduction of this legislation leads me to remark on what a remarkable change of direction the Labour Party have taken in Opposition compared to what they advocated when in Government.  What a remarkable about-turn.  When the principles he tries to espouse here in legislation were discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> not only in the 1981 period but in the longer period of Government afterwards, nothing was done about them.  The same acceptance of principles by the party then in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to comment on the three parts of the Bill, beginning with the sections dealing with gifts to office holders.  In broad terms, the Bill proposes to put limits on the value of a gift to the following office holders, given to them by virtue of the office they hold: members of the Government, the Attorney General and Ministers of State. It would introduce a detailed procedure, involving the Secretary to the Government or the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and entailing valuation of gifts, including the appointment of a valuer where necessary, and arrangements whereby the office holder concerned could offer to pay the Minister for Finance the amount by which the value of a gift exceeds £200.  It also provides for an arrangement whereby gifts could be vested in the Minister for Finance as State property.</P>
      <P>In so far as the acceptance of gifts is concerned, the introduction to the elaborate procedures proposed in the Bill might lead a casual observer of Irish politics to conclude that gift-giving to politicians was a widespread and corrupting feature of our political life, as well as being a matter of pressing social concern. The observer might also be led to believe that the problem, in so far as it actually exists, could be formally regulated in a mathematical, legalistic way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my perspective, I would have to take issue with both assumptions.  I <Col N="2287" /> acknowledge, of course, that there is a long-standing tradition whereby Ministers may give and receive gifts when visiting foreign countries or when receiving foreign dignitaries.  It is also a common occurrence for a Minister to receive a memento on the occasion of official openings.  However the scale of the problem implied by the Bill simply does not exist.  Furthermore, the circumstances in which gifts may be offered will, in the nature of things, vary considerably as between one case and another, reflecting the personal bond that may exist between donor and recipient in each case.  It would not be possible, or desirable, that the making of gifts should, in effect, be reduced to the level of a commercial transaction, with the appointment of a valuer to calculate their &ldquo;commercial price&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how any reasonable person could require an elaborate, statute-based scheme on the lines proposed in this Bill.  Deputy Howlin appears to see a bribe attaching to every gift and avaricious Ministers grabbing everything that is offered to them, but that is not the reality.  Every Minister, on coming to power, is given a copy of the <i>Government Procedure Instructions,</i> which spells out a code of conduct on gifts and conflicts of interest.  Ministers are fully aware of their position and of the duties and responsibilities of their offices.  They are emphatically not easy prey to approaches and inducements attempting to influence the exercise of their powers and functions. On the other side, companies and individuals know full well that even to attempt to offer such gifts may have very negative consequences.</P>
    <P>The benefits of our democracy include a free press and free comment and any slight suspicion that there may be abuse is fully aired.  Moreover, every Taoiseach and Minister has to win and retain the confidence of the Dáil, and the electorate are given regular opportunities to make a definitive comment on our standard of performance every few years.  Office holders carry out their duties under continual scrutiny from Parliament, the <Col N="2288" /> media and most importantly, the people of Ireland, who have the sovereign right to decide through the ballot box, whether or not they should continue in office.</P>
    <P>However, even if the Members of this House were to leave these considerations aside, and were to decide that there is a need for an elaborate system of checks and balances governing the receipt of gifts &mdash; and this is of course extremely unlikely &mdash; I do not think that the present Bill would meet that requirement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin has an exaggerated view &mdash; I know he has not had the experience of office &mdash; of this whole area of gifts.  I think he has an illusion that if he became Minister it would be the key to Aladdin's Cave or that everywhere he would go he would be showered with very valuable gifts, but I will give him the benefit of my experience, and I am sure many people in the Opposite benches will corroborate what I am saying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister knows Deputy Howlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I do not, but if the Deputy ever gets the opportunity of being a Minister he will find out it is not the glowing world he thinks it is.  Such gifts, when they are given, are relatively small mementoes to the event, and this is usually engraved on the item.  Therefore even if you thought in terms of using them subsequently for another purpose the engraving would eliminate that.  The people who make such presentations are well aware of what the customs are, and they are too intelligent and too well mannered to embarrass any Minister with an inappropriate gift.  An inventory of the type of memento involved would include such smaller items as prints of local scenes or drawings of factory premises, commemorative booklets, scrolls or brochures, small crystal vases or ornaments or designed pens which you would normally use or which would be whipped from you in the Dáil, in Brussels or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy has expectations of becoming a Minister and thinks that most of the gifts he would receive on various <Col N="2289" /> occasions would amount to close to £200 he is in for a shock and he will be very disappointed indeed.  If he was in office for a few years he might cover a few small spaces on a mantelpiece with some of the mementoes he would get, but no more. It is well known in political folklore that the late Sean Lemass had a problem with trowels.  He opened so many factories and received so many trowels that the mantelpiece was not big enough to hold them, but I think nobody would worry about that type of development.  The question of gifts is over-elaborated by Deputy Howlin.  I am sure he knows the reality of life as well as I do.  If he was less hyprocritical about our views on the Labour Party and what they stood for in previous years he might be presenting a different case.  Maybe he did not know what they stood for then.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) of the Bill excludes any gifts made to an office holder by a personal friend or member of the family of that office holder or of his spouse and for purely personal reasons.  Any gifts from such friends for personal reasons would be exempt from the provisions of this Bill and were an office holder disposed to act in an unethical manner, all he or she need do is claim that a donor is a personal friend motivated by personal reasons.</P>
    <P>We should I think also have regard to the general implications which the contents of this Bill would have for Ireland's role in Europe.  This country is a fully committed member of the EC and is intimately involved in all aspects of Community activities.  In this context, Irish office holders, are constantly meeting their counterparts in the other member states.  While these contacts may begin as simply business arrangements, it is inevitable that in many instances genuine personal friendships will develop.  If it should transpire that gifts are exchanged by office holders in the course of these contacts, we could have the embarrassing position, were this Bill to become law, of an office holder having to declare that one EC Minister was a personal friend whereas another was not.  This would hardly be conducive to amicable relations with all of our European partners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2290" /> To summarise on this section, I do not see any need to change in the existing situation and even were changes needed, this Bill's provisions would be so easily evaded as to make it worthless in the prevention of unethical conduct.</P>
    <P>The second section of the Bill proposes to create a register of the financial and other interests of members of the Dáil and Seanad.  I have stated in this House on previous occasions, and I am still of the same opinion, that we do not require legislation for such a register.  A nonstatutory scheme covers the same ground in relation to members' interests for instance, in Westminster.  While that scheme does not have statutory penalties, the House of the Commons itself has power to take appropriate action in relation to any member who does not register or furnishes false or misleading information.  I believe that if the Members of this House would wish to see such a register, the most appropriate approach would be to take it up under House rules and regulations.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's party have already raised this matter in the Committee on Procedures and Privileges.  Due to other parties' need to consult and consider the matter further, there has been little progress on the proposal as yet.  However, I understand that the matter remains on the agenda and should the Deputy wish, it can be raised again at an appropriate time.  I cannot, of course, anticipate that the different parties represented in this House would favour the establishment of such a register but I would see it as more likely to be given full consideration in such a context rather than as part of a Bill which, I believe, is unacceptable in whole or in part to the majority in this House.</P>
    <P>There is a further reason that this area should not be singled out for regulation on a statutory basis.  I am not at all satisfied that the proposed section accords with the provisions of the Constitution dealing with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Under Article 15.10 of the Constitution each House of the Oireachtas has the exclusive right to determine its own rules and procedures. <Col N="2291" /> Questions concerning Members' private finances are covered by that Article. While other matters pertaining to Oireachtas Members, such as the electoral system, Members' allowances, <i>et cetera,</i> are governed by legislation, the basis for such statutory control is explicitly laid down in the Constitution. To enshrine provisions governing Members' private financial interests in a statute rather than in the rules of the House concerned would run the risk of being in breach of the spirit &mdash; if not the letter &mdash; of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In the short time available we ran a check for the benefit of the information of the House and, of course, it is totally at variance with the picture which Deputy Howlin presented in this House as to where this registration is in being.  In Australia, the European Parliament, Germany, in the Bundestag, Israel, Japan and in the United Kingdom in the House of Commons, the registration is specified by resolutions or rules of the appropriate House.  The system in the Netherlands is voluntary and was introduced by a decision of the Chamber's presidium.</P>
    <P>The register of political parties' finances is the third part of the Bill which proposes to create a register of political parties' income and expenditure and to identify those who contribute more than £1,000 to a political party in any one year. At the end of his contribution Deputy Howlin referred to the whole question of funding of political parties, which is irrelevant to the Bill, and I will not be out of order in not dealing with it.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the Government do not accept that there is any pressing need for legislation in this area.  The Deputy may have a keen interest in the financial support which the various political parties represented in this House obtain from their Members and from private individuals.  However, there is no evidence that the Deputy's interest in this matter is shared by the public to whom we are all ultimately accountable through the electoral process.</P>
    <P>I also note that under the Bill &mdash;<Col N="2292" /> another long-winded way of dealing with this aspect &mdash; the Clerk of the Dáil would be charged with responsibility for (1) preparing and maintaining a register of all &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; political parties; (2) keeping records of annual returns made to him by all registered parties containing detailed information on each party's income and expenses, including auditors' reports and (3) making a report to Dáil Éireann every six months giving particulars of the information furnished to him by the parties.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has not made a compelling case for the additional functions proposed in this Bill regarding registration of political parties.  To the extent that the Bill ignores this issue and focuses only on the narrow question of disclosing personal contributions to parties, it is, on a fair examination, seriously defective. There may be a case for taking a broader look at the financing of political parties, preferably on an all party, non-partisan basis.  My colleagues and I would be happy to consider constructive proposals on these lines from the Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to join me in rejecting this Bill which, on close examination, is seriously defective.  It is more appropriate to deal with this matter under the rules of the House through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I suspect they will be involved in an item in the Bill which is also part of the present agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will be supporting the Second Stage of this Bill; the Labour Party asked for support in principle and we will be giving it in principle. However, there is a case for not having the code of conduct or these matters dealt with in legislation and perhaps there is a case for having it dealt with by the rules, regulations and Standing Orders of the House.  We will be supporting the Bill because we believe that, in principle, there should be some disclosure and way of making known situations which could give rise to a conflict of interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first task which should be undertaken in relation to this matter is the <Col N="2293" /> preparation of a code of conduct which would define what constitutes a conflict of interest or an improper decision on the part of an elected politician.  Arrangements in regard to disclosure of interests and the regulation of the funding of political parties are part of the supportive arrangements to ensure that such transgressions do not occur.  The first task is that of preparing a clear and unambiguous code of conduct and relatively little work has been done in this area.  As a first step, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, on an all party basis, should by regulations set down a code; perhaps they could do this with the assistance of the Attorney General who might bring together a team of officials to advise the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in that regard.  The code should apply to all Members of the European Parliament, Dáil, Seanad and local authorities and should cover such matters as relationships with outside bodies, disclosure of interests, artificial transactions and abstention from involvement where a conflict of interest might arise.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael consider it will be necessary to underpin this code with regulations governing disclosure of interests, the funding of political parties and of election campaigns.  My party believe that, as an initial move, Ministers and parliamentary committee chairmen should make a full disclosure of their assets, liabilities and income an appointment during their period of office and for a period thereafter. The disclosures should be made to a parliamentary ethics commission consisting of the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General and a judge of the High Court.  It is the view of my party that, in normal circumstances, those disclosures and the material disclosed to such an ethics commission would remain confidential.  This commission would, however, be required to oversee compliance with the code and to investigate all allegations of breach of the code of conduct referred to them.  Having completed their investigation, if such a commission were to decide that there was a breach, they could publish part or all of the report containing the contents of <Col N="2294" /> their findings on their investigation and the matter could be sent to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael strongly favour the funding of political parties by the State on the basis of a ratio to the number of votes obtained by the parties in the previous general election.  Far from parties being able to draw in money left, right and centre, I am a member of a party which had to put up the &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; sign, sell and lease back like any business would have to do simply because there have been five general elections since 1981.  I have been elected five times since 1981, we have had local elections, we are now facing into our third, there have been two European elections, a number of referenda, including the Single European Act, and the Presidential election and we have fought them all as the main Opposition party.  Far from having people falling over themselves to make a contribution to the party, I should like to inform the House that while we do get contributions from many people they are usually small. Occasionally people make large contributions and sometimes they can be persuaded to bail out a party, a constituency organisation or a candidate in an election. That is about the size of it.</P>
    <P>As someone who has had to fund personal overdrafts, constituency overdrafts and national party overdrafts, I want to put it on the record of the House that I am sick and tired of writing begging letters to people asking them if they will contribute yet again, purchase a £10, £20 or £60 ticket for a draw or contribute to a certain campaign.  It has got to the stage &mdash; we should be open and honest about this &mdash; where people cross the road when they see a TD because they are afraid they will be asked to make a contribution to party funds.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that all political parties are finding it hard to keep their heads above water financially.  The same is true of Members who have been elected to this House five times since 1981.</P>
      <P>A strong case can be made for the proper funding of political parties by the State.  Like Deputy Howlin, who I think said this, I agree that a strong case can be made for restricting the amount of money which candidates can spend in any one general election.  This, again, could be done by way of a code, an agreement or even legislation &mdash; I have no objection to which way it is done.  This is an issue which could and should be properly addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be very clear that it is not just financial contributions that are involved.  One has to get halls for public meetings, perhaps a printer will throw in a couple of thousand leaflets and someone else might provide a few cars or vans so that people can be brought to polling stations.  Other people may provide ladders or staplers.  We have to ask people for these things.  We also have to ask them if, for example, their friends or brothers will contribute something.  We all have to do these things to keep parties going.  However, it should be done on the basis of the number of votes a candidate gets in an election and if a candidate gets a larger number of votes in the next election it can be increased on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  Some system should be worked out whereby the State by and large would fund political parties.  The State should fund democracy.  It has got to the stage where it is impossible for TDs in multiseat constituencies, no matter how hard they work, to fight someone who wanders into an election campaign and squanders £20,000 because he is wealthy enough to do so or has enough wealthy friends.  Such <Col N="2296" /> people may do nothing between general elections except turn up here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a serious matter which needs to be addressed in this House.  However, it is not being addressed in this House because we all give the impression that everything is hunky-dory.  All is not hunky-dory and it is time that the matter of funding political parties was properly addressed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to Part IV of the Bill. As a Member of the House who acts as a parliamentary adviser to an organisation of composers &mdash; this is a matter of public record which I made public &mdash; I believe it is only right that such matters should be disclosed in some way other than in Deputy Ted Nealon's book.  I could have told that organisation I would act as their accountant, tax adviser, business adviser, etc. and nobody could have said boo.  There is a question here which I find difficult to accept in terms of someone who acts in a professional capacity as an adviser or someone who is involved in business outside this House.  Would it be correct for a solicitor, accountant, auctioneer, barrister, doctor or trade union official to disclose in this House details of business interests, etc. which might somehow put his client relationship in doubt?  If we were to allow the Fine Gael proposal and set up an ethics commission comprising the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman and a High Court Judge to whom all of these matters could be disclosed, if there was a breach or an alleged breach of conduct, they need only disclose publicly what they found the person to be in breach of.  One could confidentially disclose all one's interests to such a committee.  If I wanted to act <Col N="2297" /> as an adviser to somebody I could simply say to them &ldquo;I will act as your company accountant, management accountant, business adviser or tax adviser&rdquo;.  I practised as a management accountant and tax adviser and if the person for whom I was doing a job asked how he could go about doing something I did not tell him to ask somebody else, I told him how to do it.  Such people would not be trying to do anything wrong.  If a Member wants to act as an adviser or consultant to someone outside this House he can do it by calling himself whatever he wants.  There should be nothing wrong in doing this provided there is some way of disclosing this information and there is no conflict of interest.  It should not be disclosed to the Clerk of the Dáil who would have a long list of information, particularly as he would have to disclose liability in excess of £1,000.  My overdraft which is much more than that goes down a bit when my pay cheque goes through but goes up again very quickly.  One would have to disclose this information on a constant basis.  I agree in general that there should be a form of disclosure.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for the spouses of Members to have to make disclosures in the same way.  I think this happened in Australia and involved, if I am correct, the wife of the then leader of the Australian Labour Party who received more income as a model than her husband.  She told them to hump off and would not give any details of her income.  She said the same thing to the High Court and there was nothing they could do about it.  The reality is that our spouses are not part of our property.  Both our spouses and children suffer very badly because we are in public life and they are somehow dragged into public life.  However, if a spouse was involved in some form of holding which conflicted with the interests of a Member in some way, particularly if a Member put items in his or her spouse's name, that would be a matter of evasion.  If there was a parliamentary ethics commission to whom these matters could be disclosed confidentially and who would only adjudicate on these matters publicly if there was <Col N="2298" /> a conflict of interest then these matters could be addressed.</P>
    <P>I accept in principle the issue which the Labour Party have properly raised here. If, as Deputy Howlin said, they want support for their Bill on Second Stage then we will give it.  However, there are many weaknesses in the Bill which could be addressed and the Bill made more realistic.  It is hard enough to get people to go into public life.  Most people outside this House who have a decent income will not be attracted to come into this House.  If we put unrealistic and unfair barriers in place, then people will not come in either.</P>
    <P>While I am at it, I should like to take a swipe at the commission who review the conditions of Members of this House. It is totally unacceptable that the commission should set the salaries of Members of this House who work such long hours with no security and who are constantly in public view by journalists who give the impression that we all earn £60,000 or £80,000 a year plus unlimited expenses, at £26,000 while in the same report they set the salaries of district justices at £36,000 and upwards of that for any other judge.  These people have total security, receive part of their salary tax free, work much shorter hours, have great holidays and their spouses are not dragged into public life.</P>
    <P>There should also be some sort of panel to whom judges should declare their own or their spouses' interests.  Businessmen who are appointed to State boards should do the same thing.  Trade union officials in a position of influence, senior civil servants and Government advisers who influence policy should also be asked to make reasonable disclosures.  Members of this House whose total turnover before tax is £26,000 to which they can add a few daily attendance allowances and other expenses are told that they have to run their cars and constituencies on this amount.  No business in this country could run on that sort of turnover.  That is the reality of the situation.  Those of us who do not have any significant income outside of this House bar the odd quiz book&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If one does not write a quiz book, one cannot balance the accounts.  That is the reality for most of us in this House.  It is time we put this on the agenda.  We should have access to a union who could independently argue our case for us.  Those issues are relevant to the question of whether Members of this House have to look outside for income. If Members have a substantial outside income is there not an argument for defining Members as part-time or full-time Members who could be remunerated separately having regard to whether they were part-time or full-time?  We will not attract a person paid above the level of a HEO into his House at the rate we are going.  Perhaps there should be proper remuneration, proper resources for full-time Members and reduced incomes for part-time Members who have substantial outside income.  That should be considered.</P>
      <P>The companies, or former companies of Ministers, Ministers of State or TDs who do business with the State should be declared in some way.  A company who gain substantially from State contracts should, as part of the contractual arrangement, undertake not to make major contributions to any political party or politician.  If, they make such a contribution they should forfeit the contract and pay a sufficient penalty.  The Minister is probably right in saying that much of what needs to be done could be done by regulation or through a code of practice, as in other parliaments.</P>
      <P>In relation to gifts, if Ministers receive anything like the gifts the Lord Mayor of Dublin receives, they would want a separate museum in which to put their little bits and pieces on show, and nobody would be interested in seeing most of them.  However, there should be some code of practice for dealing with major contributions made to individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Bill in principle.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should lay down a code of conduct, perhaps on the advice of a team led by the <Col N="2300" /> Attorney General, and there should be an ethics committee.  The Clerk of the Dáil should not be required to do this job.  There should be an ethics committee comprising the Ombudsman, a High Court judge and the Comptroller and Auditor General who is the State's auditor.</P>
    <P>Far from having people queueing to contribute to my party, I was not too pleased with the business community who told us what wonderful fellows we were after the Tallaght strategy and then put their money somewhere else.  Our problem is getting people to contribute.  There have been great pressures on TDs and on parties since 1981 due to a record number of elections, general, local European, Presidential and referenda.  Many parties have been left in considerable difficulties after these campaigns.  If there is to be an ethics committee, and a code of conduct, we should not only look at State funding for parties.  I appeal to the House to look at the question of State funding for parties. We should also look at imposing restrictions on the amount of money which can be spent during election campaigns by individual candidates.  Some of the money spent in election campaigns is wasted in any event.  We put three posters on a lamp post because another party puts them on for the same reason.  Far from influencing anybody we run around in circles spending money which only benefits the printers.  The State should put a restriction on the amount of money candidates can spend in an election and should initiate a spot check on campaigners to ensure compliance.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have done us a service in introducing this Bill.  I hope there will be an all-party approach to dealing with it.  At a future date we might look at other elements of society to see where other conflicts of interest might arise. Fine Gael will support the principle of the Bill on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>On the surface a Bill to regulate ethics in Government and public life seems entirely wholesome, welcome and even admirable.  The three elements of the Bill, gifts, their giving and, more <Col N="2301" /> importantly, the potentially corrupting influence of their receipt, political parties, their registration and the registration of their incomes, donations and expenditure, and the registration of the interests of Members of the Dáil all seem like issues which should be addressed, in particular in so far as there is any evidence as opposed to gossip, speculation and innuendo that these are areas where there has been a problem.</P>
      <P>The issue of gifts was topical some time back.  The matter related to the potential to corrupt, of a bejewelled dagger.  I should have thought that the danger which springs to mind when daggers are at issue, is their being inserted in the back or perhaps, their being drawn forcibly somewhere between the chin and the Adam's apple, but the potential of the receipt of an elaborate and exotic gift to corrupt would not have struck me as something that requires to be addressed in law.</P>
      <P>The Bill is very interesting on the issue of gifts.  It would seem that the Labour Party's concern about the potential of gifts to corrupt, or deprave or simply to divert, applies only to politicians.  I am surprised that Deputy Mitchell did not pick this point up because he is, for all his many faults, an exponent of the rights of politicians.  The office holders defined in section 1 are all political office holders. The concern of the Labour Party does not apply to all in political life, let alone all in public life.  It applies to those in public life and, more particularly, to those who have already reached the highest levels in the land and, who are therefore in the public eye more than anybody else Ministers, Ministers of State and the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not rather odd that the quest for purity applies only to those who are arguably the most scrutinised in public life? The public service are not included in this Bill although they might be the recipients of gifts and they might have their heads turned or their opinions or their actions influenced by gifts.  Furthermore, humble backbenchers who, as we all know, have no influence and chairpersons of Oireachtas committees, as pointed out <Col N="2302" /> by Deputy Mitchell, as well as the Leaders of the Opposition parties, who may not have much influence either, are excluded.  Why is it that the Labour Party are concerned only about the potential corruption of political figures?  Is the answer that their period in office was so disillusioning?</P>
    <P>The odd thing about this part of the Bill is that not only is it aimed at public office holders who are the most visible in terms of their profile but also at those who are already governed by a code? Public servants, other office holders in the State and political office holders within this House are not covered by any code but, as the Labour Party are aware, each member of the Government on entering office is presented with a code of practice and a set of principles which they are required to apply while in office. These principles are contained in the Government procedural instructions booklet which is handed to each member of the Government on entering office.</P>

      <P>I am not holding my breath.  It establishes basic ground rules regulating, among other things, the receipt of gifts; and more important sets out instructions, the manner in which Ministers are expected to fulfil their duties and their responsibilities.  Ministers are cautioned in particular against putting themselves into a situation where there might be a conflict of interest or where might their actions be prejudiced through the receipt of gifts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the narrow focus of the Bill which concentrates on those already at the centre of public, media and political attention &mdash; perhaps this was an oversight &mdash; did the drafters of the Bill, when they sat down to draft the legislation have in mind an agenda other than one effecting an improvement in the way political <Col N="2303" /> offices are filled?  Could it be that they wanted to make political meat out of a faint concern about political ethics?</P>
    <P>There is another major flaw in the Bill which has already been adverted to by the Minister for Finance.  Section 2 (2) contains a peculiar provision.  That subsection provides that &ldquo;any gift made to an office holder is made to him &mdash; or her &mdash; by virtue of his office unless the gift is made by a personal friend or a member of the family of that office holder or of his spouse and for purely personal reasons&rdquo;.  It strikes me that any office holder who is sufficiently venal to abuse office by soliciting or receiving valuable gifts for real or imagined favours has a ready made bolthole in this section through which to escape censure.  If this Bill were to be enacted it could prove a real gift to members of the legal fraternity.</P>
    <P>To secure a prosecution under the Bill, given the provisions of section 2 (2) it would be necessary, first, to prove that a gift was given; second, that its value exceeded the statutory limit of £200; third, that the gift was not properly declared; fourth, that the donor was not a relation of any kind &mdash; a 13th cousin once removed on the mother's side or related in some obscure way by marriage would hardly be considered a relation &mdash; and finally, that the donor and recipient were not on friendly terms when the gift was given.  Incidentally, &ldquo;personalfriend&rdquo;, necessitated to trigger the defence mechanism in section 2 (2), is not defined in the interpretation section and this surely must be an oversight.  Perhaps the Labour Party when replying will deal with this matter and I for one will be fascinated to learn when this exemption would apply. Would it be limited to the person with whom one has the odd jar or the odd round of golf or would one have to have a closer and more intimate relationship before one could be considered to be a truly personal friend and could avail of the provision in section 2 (2)?</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin argued with great force and not a little passion that it is necessary for this House to get into line with every <Col N="2304" /> other civilised democracy on this issue of gift giving.  Other than Tasmania and Malta, there are not too many civilised or indeed uncivilised democracies which operate the single transferable vote multi-seat constituency system to which Deputy Mitchell referred.  I wonder if, in these circumstances, Deputy Howlin and the Labour Party would accept, given that we are out of step with civilised democracies on the issue of the STV multi-seat constituency system, that there should be an automatic acceptance on all sides of the House that we should move to a more logical well structured and more rational voting system?  I think not.</P>
    <P>I have no great problem with the registering of the interests of Members of the Dáil and Seanad.  Indeed, I believe that we will have some form of registration system in the not too distant future.  Anybody is welcome to have a look at my assets, humble as they are.  They would certainly not indicate a profligate or profitable life as a politician.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the programme for Government for the period 1981-86 included a section dealing with Dáil, Seanad and Civil Service reform. Paragraph 6 provided for the introduction of legislation under which Members of the Dáil and Seanad would be required to enter on a special register a list of enterprises or activities in which they or their spouse had a financial interest.  That was put forward in 1981 as one of the great changes that would come about but there is a heck of a difference or distance between political aspirations, as expressed in programmes, and political performance.</P>
    <P>I had a closer relationship with the Civil Service then than I do now but my clear recollection is that it was only a matter of months before Ministers in the administration led by Deputy FitzGerald took a radically different view on the need for registration of Members' interests.  I have no doubt that Deputy Spring will remember this well but it is a fact, after this matter was touched on on a number of occasions in Cabinet, that they took a radically different view and changed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deservedly so.  If Deputy Spring were to cast his mind back he would undoubtedly remember that the advice the Cabinet got at that time was that it would be far better to introduce a register in the Dáil under the rules of the House and not on a statutory basis. Deputy Spring is also aware of the constitutional provisions relating to the Members and the rules and procedures of this House and is aware just as well as I am that the best way to achieve this purpose &mdash; it is not a bad purpose &mdash; is to change the rules and procedures.  As members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are aware, this matter has been before that committee for some time and it is not the fault of Deputy Spring's party that proposals have not been made but I would suggest that it would be more appropriate to deal with this matter at that committee.  I do not believe it would be appropriate to attempt to achieve this purpose by enacting a statute.  To do so would involve fundamental problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity of raising this very important matter in the Dáil tonight. It concerns quite a number of farmers throughout our constituency of Cork South-West, which the Minister knows quite well, and throughout the country at large.  A very serious situation exists in <Col N="2306" /> the farm development office of the Department of Agriculture and Food in Clonakilty, County Cork, and all similar offices throughout the country where a work to rule policy now appertains and field officers are unable to carry out visits to farmers owing to lack of money for travelling expenses.  This is an old chestnut.</P>
      <P>Let me say at this juncture that I would like to give a minute of my time to Deputy Michael Creed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute is not a new one.  It commenced on 3 April this year and continues.  The problem was brought about over the level of grading.  It is apparent that the grading system is not satisfactory.  There was a dispute in December 1989 of which the Minister is quite aware and which was settled in February 1990.  Part of that settlement was that the duties in FDS offices would be examined and further discussions would take place between the Department and the staff concerned.  The Department carried out their own investigation and decided that some of the work was clerical officer grading but not sufficient to merit an upgrading.  How the Department arrived at this decision I do not know.  The work the Department identified as clerical officer work represents the greater part of the work in the FDS offices throughout the country, but apparently the Department have turned a blind eye to that fact.  At present employees in the FDS offices are the lowest paid clerical grade in the Civil Service.  This is a shocking indictment of the Minister and his Department that he cannot see fit to have this serious infringement of the rights of people terminated. Ironically, the staff of those FDS offices are doing work of the highest quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coupled with that dispute, all field officers in the FDS offices are unable to carry out visits to farmers owing to lack of money for travelling expenses.  This is the straw which breaks the camel's back. It is a disgraceful state of affairs that <Col N="2307" /> field officers are not given the necessary finance to visit the farmers and approve the work done.  A large number of farmers are the victims of this dispute and life is already difficult enough for the farming community without this problem.</P>
    <P>As it is the Minister of State with responsibility for Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, who is here tonight to answer this debate, I call on him as a fellow Member of the Oireachtas in that constituency to heed my request immediately, to act in the dispute and bring an end to this work to rule policy and take immediate steps to provide adequate travelling expenses for the field officers.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State to act immediately before it is too late.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Sheehan. This is the second, if not the third, time we have had an Adjournment debate on this recurring issue in the Department of Agriculture and Food's farm development offices where the farming community are being put under unfair pressure by the Department because of the Department's failure to process applications for grants.</P>
      <P>There are two problems farmers have to confront.  One is a labour relations dispute and the second is non-availability of finance for field officers to carry out inspections.  Farmers have spent and invested thousands of pounds and are waiting for thousands of pounds in grants from the Department and it is unfair in the present climate to ask them to tolerate this incompetence on the part of the Department in their effort to resolve these disputes.  As we are fishing from the same pool in Cork to a certain extent, the Minister of State is as much aware as I am of the difficulties.  I ask him to listen to the case being put here and to do everything in his power to resolve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened sympathetically to the case made by my colleagues, Deputy Sheehan and Deputy Creed about this local matter which is also a serious broader issue.  I <Col N="2308" /> concur with the remarks made about the high calibre of the staff in the Clonakilty office.  They are friends of mine as well as of the Deputies.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the work to rule which has been embarked on by members of the Civil and Public Service Union.  This dispute arises from a claim by this union for the upgrading of all posts from clerical assistant to clerical officer in the Department's FDS offices.  This claim follows on a major claim by the union for upgradings in the Department in 1989 when we agreed to upgrade a total of 222 members of the CPSU.  The majority of the upgradings took place in the Department's local offices.</P>
      <P>As regards the current claim, my Department examined the duties of the staff and came to the conclusion that the major portion of the duties involved are appropriate to the clerical assistant grade.</P>
      <P>In the context of the operation of administrative budgets and the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> my Department are unable to concede to the union's claim.  As the House will be aware, the Government attach major importance to the terms of the programme the objectives of which are to improve the economy's internal efficiency, enhance international competitiveness and remove barriers to long run development.  To these ends, the programme contains special arrangements for the operation of the pay agreement, which forms an integral part of the programme, in relation to the public service. These special arrangements provide for the negotiation of increases above the basic pay increases in certain circumstances and I would urge the union to use the machinery provided for.  The union involved have accepted the terms of the agreement and are, therefore, committed to achieving a high level of efficiency in the Civil Service.  I would be hopeful that it should be possible to come to an agreement in due course with the union on this matter within the terms of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much, as I am sure do the Deputies who raised this, the disruption <Col N="2309" /> and hardship caused to the farming community who are awaiting payments of grants.  The difficulty has arisen because of the union's decision to embark on a form of industrial action when there is another course of action open to them. As I said, negotiation is the way to sort out this problem, particularly in view of the fact that 222 upgradings were agreed in 1989.  This clearly indicates that the Department have dealt generously with earlier claims by this union.</P>
    <P>I regret that this action has led to delays in processing payments to farmers and in other essential work done from those offices.  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the House that no effort will be spared by the Department to resolve this dispute at the earliest possible date.  However, I would also appeal to the union to resume normal working immediately.</P>
    <P>On the question of travelling expenses for field officers, I should point out that it is essential that Civil Service costs, whether salaries, travelling expenses, accommodation or any other administrative item must be kept under strict control.  It is in that context that the Government have introduced the concept of administrative budgets.  The Department of Agriculture and Food have fixed specific budgets for the travelling expenses of its field staff.  We must live within these budgets and field officers and their supervisors must carefully plan their travel programmes to ensure that this is done.  In cases where the quarterly travel budget has been exhausted due to high demand for inspections officers have been allowed to anticipate expenditure from the next quarter.  I am satisfied that the resources available for travelling expenses are sufficient to meet the requirements of the various schemes. There may be occasional problems in certain offices but in the longer term I am sure that these can be resolved.  I am sure that nobody in this House would criticise the objective of maintaining strict controls on our administrative costs.</P>
    <P>I hope this problem will be resolved in a rational and adult way to the benefit of everybody concerned.</P>

      <P>With due respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, I regret that the Minister is not present on what would have been our first opportunity to question him on this important matter since the decision was announced so speedily earlier in the week.  It makes a rather unusual change that we cannot blame a Minister for letting dust settle on a report.  It was extraordinary in that we had hardly taken in the report on the morning news before we were told on the lunchtime news that the Minister was adopting a great deal of it.  Normally we would be happy to commend him on that. Fine Gael strongly support deregulation of oil prices as a principle but there are important questions to be asked about this proposal.</P>
      <P>My primary concern is the consumer, the PAYE worker who has been paying more than his or her European counterparts and certainly a great deal more than British counterparts for petrol products. I am concerned that the proposals the Minister intends to put in place will not greatly affect this position.  I was anxious to ask the Minister what happened to the enthusiastic zeal he displayed before he took office when he assured the country he would take on the oil companies, reduce petrol prices substantially and end the huge differential which existed then as now between the price paid by the Irish consumer for petroleum products and that paid by our neighbours on the Continent and in Britain.  The latter point is of particular relevance because of Cross-Border trade, smuggling etc. between here and Northern Ireland.  The reality is that two or three years later the situation is as bad and the Minister has obviously decided that he cannot control the oil companies.  He now intends to see if they can control themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has changed in the Minister's understanding of the activities, operations or likely approach of the oil companies from what led us to bring in the regulations in the first place?  Was the Minister wrong then or is he wrong now? <Col N="2311" /> The Minister has said we can look forward to higher prices in the short term. He hopes there may be reduced prices in the longer term.  Maybe he will be wrong again, as he was wrong in his expectation that he could deal with this issue substantially. There are fundamental problems in this industry which neither this approach nor the previous approach adequately sorted out.  There has been no explanation given to date for the difference in prices across the Border and here.  Distance and transport costs are roughly comparable and we should be able to achieve some clarity.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also indicate his intentions in the context of the Whitegate obligation.  The report of the commission was very confused and divided in its approach to Whitegate and reflected a difference of views between members.  It would be of interest to know what the Minister is proposing.  It is important that he should be able to tell this House how these changes will improve a very bad situation for the consumer.  What of the effects on rural villages, often in tourist areas, which have petrol pumps or small petrol stations?  These seem to be most vulnerable to closure as a result of these changes and harsher marketing conditions. The Minister has indicated that there will be some closures.  How many does he anticipate?  Where will they be and what will the consequences be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>Various forms of price controls have applied to petroleum products over much of the last 18 years.  Between 1973 and 1984, two different systems of price control operated.  The &ldquo;Outer Zone link&rdquo; introduced in 1973, linked the prices charged by the oil companies in this country to those areas of the UK known as the &ldquo;Outer Zone&rdquo;.  These were generally areas which were some distance from the larger centres of population and from the immediate vicinity of a refinery. A system based on &ldquo;justified allowable <Col N="2312" /> costs&rdquo; came into operation in 1979 following a study undertaken by the National Prices Commission.</P>
      <P>In March 1983 the Minister requested the NPC to examine price control arrangements in existence at that time, and in June 1984 a new system of price control was introduced.  The system was based on a price formula which was calculated on a monthly basis and which took account of the movement in relevant cost factors during the previous month. Under this price regime maximum prices were related to the international cost of oil and not the costs incurred by individual companies.  This system, with some alterations, operated until 1986 when a shift in Government policy ended price control on oil products and almost all other products.  The NPC was disbanded at that time.  I hope Deputy Flaherty notes the date of the change in policy.</P>
      <P>On 20 July 1987 price control on the wholesale price for petrol and autodiesel was reintroduced, when the Minister imposed price reductions.  Essentially, the new system was based directly on the old price formula system but oil companies were no longer allowed to recover the cost of freight on imports and the wholesale margin was reduced.  In mid-April 1989 the Minister reimposed price control on retail prices as well as wholesale prices by means of a maximum prices order.  In addition promotions and gift schemes were seen as being a factor in adding to this disparity.  The order reduced the distribution and retailer margins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1988 the Fair Trade Commission was asked by the Minister to inquire into conditions obtaining in regard to the supply and distribution of petrol and autodiesel.  In March 1989 revised terms of reference were given to the commission and they were asked to make recommendations on the basis of their findings as a matter of urgency. Central to this was the review of the 1981 Restrictive Practices Order.  This order prohibits differentiation in terms and condition of supply, requires retailers to accept certain minimum amounts, limits <Col N="2313" /> the number of stations a company can own and sets out other restrictions and rules for the industry.</P>
    <P>The Commission indicated that it would not be possible to present a full report to the Minister within the timescale envisaged.  Pending the completion of the final report, however, the commission issued an interim report which dealt specifically with the price control formula.</P>
    <P>The Commission made a number of recommendations which they considered gave a reasonable basis for the continuation of price control in the short term.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepted certain of the commission's recommendations and these resulted in minimal changes in retail prices.  Decisions on a number of other recommendations, including the level of retail and wholesale margins, were deferred pending receipt of the final report.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission in their report of their public inquiry into the supply and distribution of motor fuels, published on Monday this week, concluded that conditions in the trade at the time of the inquiry did not warrant the imposition of price control under section 13(1) of the Prices Act, 1958.  In addition, the International Energy Agency, in a recent report, stated that price control produced costly trade distortions and inefficiencies and recommended its abolition. In accordance with the recommendation of the commission, the Minister for Industry and Commerce intends to lift price control on petrol and autodiesel.  This will take place when there is security against anti-competitive practices which the passing of the Competition Bill will provide.  As the Minister said at a recent press conference he does not expect these changes to take place until the autumn.  Thereafter, the Minister intends to keep the option of reintroducing price control under review in order to ensure that the benefits which the commission believe should accrue to the consumer from price deregulation are realised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2314" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce is of the view that the recommendations made by the commission will lead to a restructuring of the industry which in time should result in lower prices than would obtain under price control. This view is advanced by the commission and supported by some of the major wholesalers.  Price control restricts competition and inhibits the development of competitive markets.  However, because of the existence of tight margins in the industry and because oil importers are not being fully compensated for freight and port charges, it is fair to assume that the removal of price control will lead to increased prices initially.</P>
    <P>These benefits are outlined in paragraphs 2.37 and 2.38 of the report where the commission expressed the following view of what they expected would happen if their recommendations were accepted:</P>
    <P>It is believed that the effectiveness of the recommendations of this report should ultimately be judged by comparing tax-exclusive prices in Ireland with those in other NWE (north-western Europe) countries.  While there may be some initial increases in margins, it would be expected that if the recommendations of this report are implemented margins would start to fall within a short time.  It would also be hoped that the level of margins would be lower than those obtaining in December 1990 and that the differential compared with other NWE countries would be reduced.</P>
    <P>The lowering of prices to consumers will be brought about, it is believed, by increased competition.  This competition will lead to a restructuring of the system of distribution.  It is likely that the reduction in the number of retailers will continue and may be intensified.</P>
    <P>The decision by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to remove price control on motor spirits does not include the removal of the oil companies' obligation to buy from Whitegate.  This is a separate matter for which the Minister for Energy has primary responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2315" /> I should like to inform Deputy Flaherty that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, is on an official visit to a north eastern Europe area and he too was prepared for the occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is important and sufficiently urgent to be aired on the floor of the House this evening.  Garda sources in Cork last evening disclosed that members of the Force carrying out an investigation into serious crime had been intimidated by organised gangs in Cork.  I believe this intimidation is also being carried out in other parts of the country.  While the gardaí, no doubt, are trained to withstand some type of coercion or intimidation this is unacceptable behaviour and the full weight of the law and the courts must be brought into play to enable the custodians of the law to carry out their duties in a manner which is necessary for any democracy to survive.</P>
      <P>An attack on the Garda is an attack indirectly on this House where the laws and regulations that govern our society are made.  It is vitally important that that point be spelt out to those who endeavour to take the law into their own hands and actually damage Garda property such as cars, smash their windows, pour paint on their walls and so forth.  At one stage the houses of two gardaí were fire bombed. This type of action must be condemned outright for what it is.  The godfathers of crime see their place in society threatened by the forces of law and will take any action necessary to safeguard themselves, their gangs and their illgotten gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister for Justice recently indicated that he would be taking the names and addresses of the Garda off the postal register, but that is only a temporary method of trying to safeguard the Garda who are in the front line in the fight against crime.  Much more must be done, whether by legislation or otherwise. The Garda must be seen to have <Col N="2316" /> the full force of this House behind them. The most serious aspect of this intimidation is not so much the attack on the gardaí but rather the attack on witnesses. If the Garda can be attacked and intimidated in investigating crime, then that is only the tip of the iceberg.  In any case coming before the courts there must be a very large number of witnesses who can be very easily intimidated.  People who would do that would stop at nothing to protect their position and not to be taken to court.</P>
    <P>Where the property of the Garda is attacked and where they have to replace some of their property, such as a car, windows, or their insurance policy, as the case may be, there should be some method of compensating them.  I would ask the Minister to take a sympathetic view of that aspect.  This House must go on the record and say, without fear of contradiction, that we will stand by the Garda who are enforcing the laws we have made in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there have been allegations made in the press that criminal gangs are attacking homes and property of members of the Garda in Cork in an attempt to intimidate them and thwart the course of justice.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that two members' cars were damaged in Cork in the past two years and that a member's home in the city was attacked five years ago.  These unusual and isolated cases were thoroughly investigated by the Garda and the culprits in each case were brought to justice.  This is hardly the stuff to cause a panic to a force as stalwart as the members of the Cork East and West Divisions of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course any attempt at any time to intimidate the Garda by such personal attacks is totally unacceptable. Such attempts would of course be of public interest and deserving of media attention. It is obvious however that a recent article in a Cork evening newspaper exaggerates ludicrously the instances of such intimidation.  I am concerned that such <Col N="2317" /> sensational coverage fosters unnecessary fear, especially among vulnerable members of the community.  The suggestion is being made to them that criminal gangs are getting the upper hand on the Garda Síochána.  I can assure the House that this most certainly is not the case in Cork or anywhere else in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are not easily intimidated and they are determined the criminal in this country will not be allowed to triumph.  I must make it absolutely clear to this House that threats and bullying will never influence the Garda in how they go about protecting the community and seeing to it that the criminal is brought to justice.</P>
    <P>Anyone who thinks he can engage in intimidation should note that criminal gangs in this country who have tried in the past to use threats, intimidation and other methods to hoodwink and override the law have been tirelessly hunted down and brought to face the full rigours of justice.  Many criminals who were responsible for gang-type crimes and who may have thought for a time that they were above the law are now where they belong &mdash; behind bars.</P>
    <P>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy, for the House and for the public at large.</P>

Up to 600 householders will benefit.  At present 250 householders are without mains water and 350 households in the Abbeydorney-Killflynn area have a very poor water supply.  In the areas that are not served by a mains water supply at present, the residents have had to make their own arrangements, either by boring their own wells or by building water troughs.  I might add that the water in the wells is of very poor quality because of its iron content.  Indeed, some households in this area have no water supply whatsoever and they are forced to draw water by various methods.  A large number of farmers will benefit from this scheme. In times of drought, these farmers are greatly inconvenienced and their production is affected.  Many farmers are facing financial ruin at present because of falling incomes.

      <P>I am very happy to confirm to Deputy Deenihan that the financial arrangements for the scheme are in place. Last month the Department approved a grant of £500,000 in respect of Phase 3 of this scheme &mdash; the farmers' bridge <Col N="2319" /> scheme &mdash; and taken together with the £900,000 in grants that have already been put in place for Phase 1 and 2 it means that a total of £1.4 million in grants has been allocated to this scheme.  This is a major scheme, of course, and provides a major part of the infill for the Kerry central regional water supply scheme and will deal with 1,000 households and farms in total.  It is costly to construct and traverses the heartland of the regional scheme.  It means upsizing of pipes, which has been agreed with Kerry County Council.</P>
      <P>Phases 1 and 2 are almost complete, and this serves 600 houses: Phase 3 which is about to commence will deal with 160 houses and farms.  It will extend the water supply to Cappagh, Abbeydorney and Killflynn and will eliminate the water quality problems to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>The designs for Phases 4 and 5 are being examined at present.  It is a very large scheme and an unusually large amount of money is being given to it.  It has high priority and is drawing down an enormous amount of the available moneys I have under that heading for the whole of the country.  A lot of it is going to County Kerry.</P>

      <P>I do not think any member could do justice to the work carried out by the Irish Guide Dogs Association in two minutes; however, I shall try.  The Irish Guide Dogs Association has improved the quality of life for many <Col N="2320" /> blind people throughout the country by virtue of the service they provide for the mobility and aftercare of blind persons. They have provided this service since their foundation without any Exchequer funding and I wish to raise this matter with the Minister tonight.  I plead with the Minister to recognise the work of this organisation in a meaningful way by paying an annual Exchequer grant to defray their running costs.</P>
      <P>The Irish Guide Dogs Association was founded in 1976 by Mary Dunlop and Jim Dennehy and has gone from strength to strength.  Their aims are to supply guide dogs, to operate a breeding scheme for suitable dogs, to instruct the blind and visually impaired to use guide dogs and to give the blind and visually impaired training in long cane and orientation skills.  They opened a guide dog training centre in the Model Farm Road in Cork in 1981 and recently have expanded it. To date they have received but a token grant from the national lottery for the works they have carried out.  It is unfair to expect an organisation like this to survive on arbitrary grants such as funds from the national lottery, which is subject to the vagaries of the political system. An organisation that provides such an excellent service deserves more.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing one guide dog is approximately £5,000 and the total operating cost of the association in one year is approximately £180,000.  They provide approximately 24 trained dogs to blind persons in any given year but they could provide far more if they had the financial resources to do so.  I appeal to the Minister to familiarise himself with the excellent work they are doing and to initiate a consultation process with the Irish Guide Dogs Association to put them on a firm financial footing by allocating annual Exchequer funding to defray their running costs, thus enabling them to improve the quality of life for blind people in this country.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health have received no application in recent years for additional funding for the Irish Guide Dogs Association.  In 1987 the Minister for Health received an application for a grant towards the association's trainers salaries and expenses.  However, due to the limited resources available and the fact that the association at that time had considerable reserves of funds, the Minister was unable to accede to their request. We are very conscious of the valuable service provided by the association to blind people and if a further application for additional funding is received, it will be considered very carefully.</P>

      <P>St. Ita's is a geriatric hospital situated in Newcastle West.  As the Minister is aware, there has been a great increase in the number of older people in the past number of years; in fact, demographic trends show that we will have an expanding older population and obviously this will put pressure on the geriatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>They have a case assessment unit in St. Ita's Hospital and, let me say, that I compliment them because they act independently. Recently I heard a Fianna Fáil politician say that the politicians should be involved in this function but I disagree with him because I am aware of the inherent dangers in that.  There is a waiting list for St. Ita's Hospital.  Despite the increasing number of older people who are making demands on the hospital, the number of places has been reduced over the past few years.  Will the Minister increase the number of places in the hospital to cater for the increasing demand?</P>

      <P>We have been informed by the Mid-Western Health Board that St. Ita's geriatric hospital in Newcastle West, County Limerick, is currently providing an extremely effective service.  The hospital has a complement of 170 beds catering for a population of between 10,000 and 11,000 <Col N="2322" /> elderly people aged 65 years and over. There are six rehabilitation beds in the hospital.  A day hospital introducing a special activity centre was opened within the past two years and has proved very successful.  As a result of these facilities becoming available the hospital's admission rate has trebled.  Transport is provided for the patients using the day hospital.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> makes provision for an increase in the numbers of extended care beds available for the elderly.  Each health board has been asked to prepare a plan in this connection.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board as part of their plan to implement commitments under the PESP intend to increase the number of rehabilitation beds in St. Ita's hospital to 15.  This will result in a reduction in some long stay beds.  At present there are 20 welfare beds in St. Ita's but it is hoped that these will be phased out as alternative places become available in sheltered housing schemes and through boarding out arrangements.</P>
      <P>St. Ita's hospital employs one part-time medical officer who supervises the day hospital.  A consultant geriatrician also holds one session per week in the hospital.  I trust that this information confirms the importance of and the respect there is for St. Ita's hospital and its contribution to our health service.</P>

      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter.  As so often is the case with my contributions on Adjournment debates this has to do with the problems of the mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter this evening because I have written to the Department of Health and to the Minister outlining specific difficult situation which have come to my attention and to which, so far, I have not had a reply and parliamentary questions I have tabled have been unsatisfactorily and inadequately answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the cutbacks in the availability of nappies and plastic pants for <Col N="2323" /> the adult mentally handicapped who are living at home, serious difficulties are being created for the elderly parents of these adult mentally handicapped by the fact that these nappies are being rationed out to them.  These people have done a lifetime's work looking after their severely mentally handicapped children &mdash; they are not children but young adults or middle aged adults.  They have saved the State a great deal of money and in most cases they are getting no carer's allowance.  They are being disadvantaged because certain health boards and health centres are withholding these nappies. There is the ridiculous situation that people who need nine or ten nappies a day are being issued with four or five.  If they need nine or ten, they need nine or ten and there is no point giving them half that number.</P>
    <P>There are specific difficulties in the Crumlin health centre.  I outlined the details in a letter to the Department of Health in February and still have not got a reply.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this problem because these people are paying up to £10 a day to buy these nappies to which they are entitled.  Let the Minister look into the problem and review it but, for goodness sake, intervene and resolve the problem where there are serious difficulties.</P>

However, if Deputy Fennell is aware of individual cases of difficulty or if the case to which she is referring has already been represented to the Department, the Minister for Health is prepared to immediately refer the details again to the relevant health board for urgent investigation and reply to the Deputy.  I can assure the Deputy that if she contacts the Minister's office in the morning this will be done.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the matter of an industrial dispute which has affected the three hospitals in Waterford city for the last three weeks &mdash; St. Patrick's, St. Otteran's and Waterford Regional Hospital.  The domestic staff have been on strike and this has seriously disrupted the catering and cleaning services in the hospitals.</P>
      <P>I am aware that for the past two days the union concerned, the ATGWU, have been meeting with officials of the health board at the Labour Court in an effort to resolve this dispute, but if the dispute is not resolved quickly I am afraid there will be an escalation which will affect all hospitals in the south-eastern region and may actually spread to other categories employed in those hospitals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>After 30 hours of conciliation under the auspices of an officer of the Labour Relations Commission the South-Eastern Health Board requested the Labour Court to intervene.  The Labour Court heard both sides of the case on 26 April 1991 and 6 May 1991 and issued <Col N="2325" /> their recommendation earlier today, which, among other things, have requested an immediate return to work. It is understood that the ATGWU workers are being balloted later today on the recommendation.  The South-Eastern Health Board have indicated that they are prepared to accept the recommendation of the court.  We are all <Col N="2326" /> hoping, as I am sure Deputy Deasy and his colleagues from Waterford are, that the recommendation of the Labour Court will be accepted immediately and that the staff will return to work to ensure that a proper level of services is delivered to the patients in those institutions.</P>

      <P>The road investment measures outlined in the Operational Programme on Peripherality have first and foremost to be seen in the context that Ireland is regarded as a single region for the purposes of the EC Structural Funds.  The primary objective of that investment is to reduce the impact of Ireland's peripheral location by cutting the transport cost differential between this country and its Community partners.  To achieve that objective, it is necessary to concentrate investment on priority routes and on projects which would give the best return in terms of reducing the adverse effects on the Irish economy of our peripheral location.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this concentration of resources, the operational programme provides for substantial road investment in each of the sub-regions.  It is also important to appreciate that investment in priority routes such as the N1, N4, and N7 not only benefits the areas in which the investment takes place, but also has a substantial impact on other areas served by those routes in terms of shorter travel times and improved access to major ports and airports and the main domestic markets.</P>

      <P>The Interdepartmental Committee in question will be set up within the next two weeks and details of the review and the precise terms of reference will be announced at that time.  The committee will consist of representatives from the Department of Justice, the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications and the Garda Síochána and a representative of my own Department who will be chairman.  When details of the review are announced, local authorities and other interested bodies and individuals will be free to submit views for consideration by the committee.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>The rights of a tenant must, in the first place, be determined by reference to the terms of the lease or other tenancy agreement under which the tenancy is held. Tenants of dwellings affected by the finding that the Rent Restrictions Acts were unconstitutional have their rights to tenure protected under the provisions of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982.  These rights are not affected where there is a change of ownership.  I have no proposals to bring in corresponding provisions in relation to other tenants in private rented accommodation who, when they have been tenants for 20 years or more, may have tenure rights under the landlord and tenant code which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The proposals in <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> to introduce additional safeguards for tenants in the private rented sector relate to the introduction of mandatory rent books, statutory minimum standards of accommodation, and a minimum notice to quit of four weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 47, 59, 165 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>As regards existing Government buildings, I have previously written to my Cabinet colleagues asking them to ensure that provision is made for access for the disabled to buildings under their control. Local authorities have been asked to observe the requirements in the proposed building regulations which were issued in May 1984 and the funding arrangements for local authority offices, libraries and swimming pools are now subject to provision of adequate access for the disabled as set out in the proposed regulations.</P>
      <P>For the future, building regulations to be made under section 3 of the Building Control Act, 1990, will place a very clear duty on people providing or reconstructing buildings to cater for the needs of disabled people.  Following the enactment of the Act, draft building regulations and related technical guidance documents were circulated for comment. The proposals were also submitted to the Commission of the European Communities in accordance with the requirements of EC directive 83/189 EEC which requires member states to consult with the Commission in relation to any proposed technical regulations and standards. The regulations and technical guidance documents have been redrafted in the light of the comments received, and they have now been resubmitted to the Commission.  When clearance is received from the Commission, which could take a minimum of three months, I will be in a position to make the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 of the Building Control Act provides for the making of building control regulations, which would contain procedural, administrative and control arrangements for the operation of the building control system.  It is my intention that building control regulations will be made at the same time as building regulations. I also have in mind the establishment of a Building Regulations <Col N="2089" /> Advisory Body at, or as soon as possible after, the time the building regulations are made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>The 1991 road grant allocation of £3.951 million to Cavan County Council represents an increase of 4 per cent over the 1990 payments of £3.812 million and a 47 per cent increase over the 1989 payments of £2.690 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2099" /> The cost of the upkeep and maintenance of regional and county roads falls to be met from the local authority's own resources, supplemented by discretionary grants from my Department. The 1991 discretionary grants notified to Cavan County Council amount to £2.849 million, which represents an increase of 6 per cent over 1990 and 86 per cent compared with 1989.  This overall 1991 figure includes a supplementary grant of £600,000 and a grant of £250,000 for stolen damage.  These extra sums were included because of the special needs of County Cavan.</P>
    <P>In contrast, expenditure on road works by Cavan County Council from their own resources declined from £1.143 million in 1986 to £0.347 million in 1990, with a provision of £0.405 million in their 1991 estimates.</P>
    <P>There are no funds available to me from which further grants could be made available to Cavan County Council in 1991.  In the circumstances I cannot see what could be achieved by meeting a deputation from the council.</P>

    <P>The EC mandatory limit of 0.2 mg/1 in drinking water has been applied in Ireland by the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988.

These figures are not comparable, however, due to the changes in local expenditure during that period including the termination of various levies and the substitution of capital grants for loans for major services and the termination of loan charges for such services.</P>

    <P>I do not accept that there is a housing crisis in the country.  Furthermore, I am satisfied that the capital allocations to local authorities for their housing construction programme in 1991 &mdash; an increase of 35 per cent over 1990 &mdash; the increased capital provision for the voluntary housing scheme, and the various initiatives announced in <i>A Plan for <Col N="2101" /> Social Housing</i> represent a reasonable response to existing housing needs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 76 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>The meeting which I had on 12 April last with city and county engineers was one of a series of periodic meetings which I have with these officials.  Topics such as the condition of non-national roads, the efficiency of discretionary road grant expenditure and emergency road maintenance were discussed.  The engineers agreed to expedite finalisation of a code of practice for emergency repairs and as to the futility of attempting to carry out such repairs when weather conditions were unfavourable.  They undertook to carry out a crash programme to deal with the backlog of urgent repairs in the coming weeks as weather conditions improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989, the Government recognised the serious deterioration in the condition of non-national roads, especially regional and county roads, and made a commitment that £150 million would be provided over three years in discretionary grants to county councils for these roads. This commitment has more than been <Col N="2103" /> fulfilled; in fact, total grants over the three years will amount to £182.4 million, including £3.755 million in extra storm/flood grants notified to local authorities on 3 May 1990.</P>
    <P>Total discretionary grants for 1991 are £68.13 million and have already been notified to local authorities.  These absorb in full the funds available to me for this purpose in 1991.</P>

The estimated cost of the proposed roundabout is £250,000. After full consideration, it was decided that the channelised junction which was <Col N="2104" /> originally proposed by the local authority, and which has now been constructed, is the most appropriate, having regard to the likely volumes of both through and turning traffic on all approaches to the junction.  The local authority have been informed that the cost of the proposed roundabout would not be accepted as a charge against road grants.</P>

    <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board submitted a five year draft development plan leading to 1993 and beyond, proposing capital expenditure on a number of projects <Col N="2110" /> of £32.69 million and requesting that these projects be considered for ERDF funding.  Funding was not sought for particular years but in relation to individual projects whose starting dates were not specified.  To date two projects, stage II of the South Bank Container terminal project and the provision of additional bulk handling facilities at Alexandra Quay, have been aided under the operational programme for peripherality in the amount of £406,000.</P>

      <P>In recent years over £11 million has been injected into the development of Howth harbour and it can now be considered <Col N="2111" /> to have reached an advanced stage of development.</P>
      <P>Future development plans, which include the provision of an auction hall, have been included in my Department's Fishery Harbour Development Programme 1989-1993, which I announced in October, 1990.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have regularly met harbour users, particularly the Howth Fishermen's Association and discussed future development plans with them.  The last such meeting was held last February, and future meetings can be arranged as appropriate.  I myself will certainly be prepared to consider holding a meeting if there are important issues arising, along the lines mentioned, which cannot be reasonably resolved at official level.</P>

      <P>Sanctions against Iraq were imposed by UN Security Council resolution 661 on 6 August 1990.  Operative paragraph 3(c) of that resolution specifically excludes from the sanctions regime &ldquo;supplies intended strictly for medical purposes&rdquo;. The relevant resolution was given effect in the European Community by EC Regulation 2340 of 8 August 1990, as amended.</P>
      <P>The supervision of the sanctions regime in the UN is the responsibility of the Sanctions Committee of the Security Council.  Ireland is not at present a member either of the Security Council or of the Sanctions Committee.</P>
      <P>I am aware of reports that, in spite of the above-mentioned exemption, some sections of the Iraqi population have faced difficulties because of shortages of medical supplies.  The UN Secretary General sent the Under Secretary General, Mr. Ahtisaari, to assess humanitarian needs in Iraq during March and he submitted his report to the Secretary General on 20 March 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then, Resolution 687 of the Security Council dated 3 April 1991 provided for a number of modifications of the sanctions regime against Iraq, including the exemption of exports to Iraq of foodstuffs (subject to the Sanctions Committee being notified) and materials and supplies for essential civilian needs, subject to the approval of the committee by accelerated procedure.  The resolution <Col N="2119" /> also allows for imports of goods from Iraq, if approved by the Sanctions Committee, thus ensuring that Iraq will have adequate financial resources to pay for imports.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are in train to modify Community legislation to bring it into line with these changes in the UN resolution.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I would greatly deplore any impediment to the supply of medical requirements.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is <Col N="2120" /> referring to the staffing implications for the Customs and Excise service of the completion of the EC Single Market.</P>
      <P>Decisions in many important areas still remain to be taken at EC level before the shape of the post-1992 arrangements can be finalised.  While it is intended that frontier controls will be discontinued for intra-EC trade, these will have to be replaced by effective new arrangements so as to protect revenue receipts, which will require involvement of revenue personnel. Frontier controls <i>vis-à-vis</i> third countries will be maintained and may indeed need to be strengthened.  The precise implications for Customs and Excise staffing and the extent of the redundancies, if any, that may ensue, cannot be determined until EC discussions are more advanced.</P>
      <P>In the meantime.  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the position is being kept under close review and that staff interests are being kept informed of developments.  The commissioners have assured staff that up to the end of 1992 there will be no contraction of functions or staff resources specifically arising out of the completion of the Single Market.</P>

      <Quest>if, following the introduction of self-assessment for tax payers, his attention has been drawn to the fact that a number of citizens have paid excess tax and are still awaiting payment of a rebate as promised by the Collector General; the number of tax payers affected; the total amount involved for the last two tax years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no delays in repaying established overpayments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may have in mind notices of assessment which issue to taxpayers following the processing of their income <Col N="2121" /> tax returns.  Those notices draw the taxpayer's attention to possible excess payments. It should be noted that these are not established overpayments and require further investigation by the Inspector of Taxes.</P>
    <P>Excess payments have always been a feature of the tax system.  The number has increased since the commencement of self assessment due to improved tax payment patterns.  The Revenue Commissioners are constantly seeking ways to speed up the examination of these apparent excess payments.  In the past year new administrative procedures have been introduced and the changeover to the current year basis of assessment means that only one year's return is now required to finalise the tax liability for years 1990/91 onwards.  Statistics are not kept of the value of apparent excess payments awaiting examination.  There are currently 12,000 such payments to be examined.  Examination of most of these will be completed by the end of the month.  The vast majority are for relatively small amounts and result from the processing of returns recently received. The number on hands is not significant bearing in mind that this is the peak period for the processing of returns. Some 90,000 returns have been received by inspectors of taxes since 1 January and the processing of these returns is now almost complete.</P>

      <P>My function in relation to the provision of funding of tourism promotion relates solely to the ERDF special border areas programme which covers the Counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  Phase II of this programme, covering the period 1986-1991, provides ERDF aid for energy and tourism measures.</P>
      <P>On the tourism side the measures aided under the programme are tourism promotion, the provision of tourist amenities and infrastructure and access roads.</P>
      <P>The programme provides for a total amount of £0.55 million ERDF aid for the promotion of tourism in the area over the period of the programme; this is not apportioned on an annual basis.  Because many of the promotional measures embrace more than one county, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the allocation on a county-by-county basis.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a van with side windows and seating to the rear of the driver's seat was seized by officers of Customs and Excise when an attempt was made by the person in question to import it through the green &ldquo;Nothing to Declare&rdquo; channel at the B &amp; I ferryport without payment of the proper import charges due.  In such a case the vehicle is liable to forfeiture and the importer liable to prosecution.</P>
      <P>The commissioners decided to refrain from proceedings and offered release of the vehicle on compromise terms.  Following an appeal by the person in question, the amounts of the terms were reduced to release for immediate exportation on payment of a compromise sum of £550 or for retention in the State on payment of a compromise sum of £2,750. These terms reflect the fact that the vehicle is liable to 24.7% excise duty as a result of its conversion.  The new terms have been notified to the person concerned and he has been given until 14 May to avail of them.</P>
      <P>Having reviewed the case the commissioners are not willing to reduce the terms any further.  They are, however prepared to extend the period for payment to the end of June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that certain EC directives in preparation for the open market in 1992 and for which my Department is responsible will require implementing legislation.  An examination is in progress on the legislative implications of a number of other such directives.</P>
      <P>Directives which require legislation:</P>
      <P>Financial Services</P>
      <P>Legislation will be required to set out provisions in relation to annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and related financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Investment Services</P>
      <P>Arising from the draft directive on investment services in the securities field and the draft directive on capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions, legislative measures will be necessary primarily to establish a system of authorisation for investment firms involved in broking, dealing, transmission, portfolio management and underwriting in respect of investment instruments.</P>
      <P>Arising from a proposed directive on harmonisation of investor compensation schemes to be adopted by 30 June 1993, legislative proposals will be necessary to provide investor compensation measures.</P>
      <P>Public Procurement</P>
      <P>In public procurement, national legislation will be needed in particular for directives in the 1992 programme which provide for procedures to review the award of contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2125" /> Taxation of Companies</P>
    <P>It is proposed to implement the directive on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States under section 31 of the 1991 Finance Bill as initiated.</P>
    <P>The legislative implications of the following Directives are being examined:</P>
    <P>Financial Services</P>
    <P>Second council directive 89/646/EEC of 15 December 1989 on the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and amending directive 77/780/EEC.</P>
    <P>Taxation of Companies</P>
    <P>Council Directive 90/434/EEC of 25 July 1990 on the common system of taxation applicable to mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different Member States.</P>
    <P>Customs, Excise and VAT</P>
    <P>The completion of the Single Market will entail significant changes to the customs, excise and VAT systems. Implementation of these changes will clearly require national legislation to give effect to the relevant EC directives in many cases.  For example, it is envisaged that legislation would be required to put in place the revised system for the control and movement of excisable goods and the rates and structures of VAT and excise <Col N="2126" /> duties to apply after 1992.  It is not possible at this stage to identify, in full, the legislative changes that will be required.</P>

The Deputy will note that the county development teams are not directly involved in the formation of this task force.

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have powers to acquire compulsorily lands or easements or other rights over lands under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, the Canals Act, 1986 and the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990. Details of the powers and the procedure to be followed by the commissioners are contained in each of those Acts.  These powers have not been used in the past but they are currently being exercised in connection with the restoration of the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell navigation which is now deemed to be part of the Shannon navigation.</P>
      <P>Under the National Monuments Acts, the Commissioners of Public Works may compulsorily acquire any national monument, or land in the vicinity of a national monument for the provision of visitor facilities.  The acquisition of the extensive site at Tara a number of years ago is an example of the use of such powers.  It is hoped that the use of the commissioner's compulsory acquisition powers will not be necessary in the area mentioned in the question in the immediate future.  Under the Planning Acts, the Office of Public Works is obliged to consult with the local authority on the proposed development and this has been done.</P>

    <P>I would refer the Deputy to An Bord Glas's &ldquo;Programme for the Development of Horticulture&rdquo; which sets out a five-year plan up to 1993 aimed at developing the potential of the horticultural industry. The targets for the industry are a combined domestic market share recovery <Col N="2135" /> and export expansion of £60 million of which £53 million relates to fruit and vegetables.  This is the best estimate of what can be achieved in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to forecast accurately what percentage of the increased production will be absorbed by import substitution, increased domestic consumption or exports.</P>

      <Quest>if he will review the case of a person (details supplied in County Meath who was refused a special beef premium because it was alleged that he did not comply with the rules in that he sold cattle within the period in which they were to be inspected in view of the fact that (1) he gave two weeks notice to the local veterinary office that he would sell some cattle because of financial difficulties and at the end of the two weeks he gave another week's notice that he would be selling and (2) the rule which disallowed him payment i.e. that cattle must be inspected before sale, was later waived.</Quest>

As neither the four cattle concerned nor their identity cards were seen by any of my Department's staff, therefore, it has not been possible to pay the 1990 special beef premium in this case.</P>
      <P>While it is true that some flexibility was conceded later in 1990 in the rules governing the 1990 special beef premium scheme, that flexibility did not extend to making payments on animals in respect of which it could not be established that payment had not been previously made and would not be made in the future.</P>

      <P>A claim for injury benefit was received from the person concerned on 12 February 1991 arising from an accident she had at work on 6 September 1990.</P>
      <P>Following investigation, injury benefit was awarded to her with effect from 25 January 1991 which was the first day she was medically certified as being incapable of work.  Injury benefit at the weekly rate of £81.70 in respect of herself and her three dependent children was authorised from 25 January to 6 March 1991, the end of the 26 week injury benefit period which commenced at the date of the accident. Her weekly rate increased to £87.10 from 15 February 1991 when pay-related benefit became payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2161" /> Payment of disability benefit was authorised from 7 March 1991 at the weekly rate of £63.10, which included £5.40 weekly pay-related benefit.  Payment was made with effect from 9 March 1991 and continued to be made to her each week until 26 April 1991.  No medical evidence has been received from her since 26 April 1991.</P>
    <P>While she was awaiting a decision on her claim she applied for supplementary welfare allowance and was paid a total of £508 by the health board for the period 9 February to 30 March 1991.  This amount had to be recovered from the arrears of £510 injury benefit and disability benefit due to her for the period 25 January to 8 March 1991.  A cheque for the balance of £2 issued to her on 3 May 1991.</P>
    <P>It is open to the claimant to claim disablement benefit if, as a result of the accident, she had suffered any loss of physical or mental faculty.  A claim form for this purpose has been issued to her.</P>

      <P>The question of introducing a pension for widowers without dependent children will be considered in the light of the recommendations of the National Pensions Board on the development of a new national pensions system.  The board's report on this matter is expected to be completed by mid summer.

      <P>At the outset, I have to say that it is not accurate to suggest that there is a standard period for processing naturalisation applications such as is mentioned in the question.  The time taken to process an application is the minimum time necessary to make inquiries to ensure that the legal requirements for naturalisation are met.  There are, from time to time, exceptional applications which may be delayed considerably because of, for instance, the applicant's inability to provide the documentation necessary to validate the application. However, everything possible is done to keep such delays to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Administrative procedures are reviewed from time to time in my Department and where improvements can be made, either through the introduction of modern technology or otherwise, they are introduced.  I have asked that the procedure for processing applications for <Col N="2164" /> naturalisation be reviewed as soon as practicable to see whether it could be improved.</P>

As the Deputy will be aware these courses of treatment are of their nature protracted, taking on average 18 to 24 months to complete.</P>

      <P>Following reports in November 1990 in the UK on possible risks associated with food wrapping materials including certain plasticisers commonly used in clingfilm, my Department, as a precautionary measure, advised the public to avoid the use of clingfilm in wrapping food for microwave or conventional ovens or for wrapping foods with a high fat content.  I also referred the issue for consideration to the Food Safety Advisory Committee. The chairman of the committee has just submitted the report to me.</P>
      <P>The main findings of the report are as follows.  Clingfilm should not be used in conventional ovens and for cooking in microwave ovens, it may however be used for de-frosting.  The use of clingfilm to wrap certain foods e.g. fresh meat and cheese provides a useful protection from contamination and the report does not see the need to advise against such use. The thicker films used by manufacturers for wrapping meat and cheese do not cause concern.</P>
      <P>The report further recommended that there should be correct labelling showing the constituents of clingfilm products and that no new material should be approved for use in packaging unless their safety can be demonstrated.</P>
      <P>I propose to take up these findings with other relevant Government Departments and public agencies.</P>

      <P>Following a press report in October last year, in which it was alleged that the administration of pertussis vaccine to children in a number of orphanages in the Dublin area in the sixties and seventies <Col N="2183" /> was utilised for the purposes of commercial drug tests of the particular vaccines, I requested officials of my Department to inquire into the matter.</P>
      <P>These inquiries indicate that in the sixties comparative studies comparing 3-in-1, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, and separate Polio immunisation with a 4-in-1, all vaccines combined, were carried out on children resident in orphanages in the Dublin area.  The 4-in-1 was in use in the UK at the time.  In the seventies, an evaluation was conducted into the use of different types of Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus Vaccines, all of which vaccines were licensed.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the introduction of the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987-90, any trials of medicines would now be subject to the provisions of that legislation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with the agreement between the Government and INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>School authorities are responsible for arranging the organisation of the school so as to ensure that no class group exceeds the following guidelines: 39 (in the case of a single-grade class-group); 38 (in the case of a class-group with two consecutive grades) and 35 (in the case of a multigrade class-group)</P>
      <P>An application was made, in May 1990, by the board of management of St. Patrick's girls national school, Donabate, for the appointment of an additional assistant teacher to the school for the 1990-91 school year.</P>
      <P>The school is a six-teacher school having also a shared post of remedial teacher.  The enrolment on 30 September 1989, which determines the staffing for the school-year 1990-91, was 183.  The enrolment required for a seventh teacher in that year was 210.  Accordingly there were no grounds on which to grant the board's request.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the enrolment in the school does not breach the maximum class size guidelines and therefore the appointment of an additional assistant is not warranted.</P>

      <Quest>if the details of the internal Irish Rail inquiry into the train crash at Knock, County Mayo in September 1989 will be published; the reason there has been no follow-up to the inquiry; if his attention has been drawn to a recent incident on the same railway line; the reason no attempt has been made to issue any compensation to any of the 45 people who were hurt in the accident; whether he has satisfied himself with the medical care and attention received by the injured when they were sent home by bus without being offered overnight accommodation at Castlebar hospital; the reason for the accident; the steps he has taken to ensure that it will not recur; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Following a derailment near Claremorris in September 1989, which resulted from a collision between a passenger train and a herd of cattle, Iarnród Éireann established an internal inquiry to ascertain the cause of this accident and also to examine in detail the possibilities of eliminating or reducing hazards in the operation of accommodation level crossings.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the chairman of CIE that Iarnród Éireann are in the process of implementing the recommendations contained in the report of the internal inquiry.  However, it is not the practice to publish internal reports of this nature.  I understand that Iarnoród Éireann are maintaining regular contact with the farming bodies, both in private and through public meetings, to achieve a greater awareness of safety at railway level crossings.</P>
      <P>As legal proceedings have been issued against Iarnród Éireann for damage arising from the Claremorris derailment, the Deputy will appreciate that I am unable to make any comment on the question of compensation or the reason for the accident.  In relation to the medical treatment received by the persons injured in the accident, this is a question which should more appropriately be addressed to my colleague the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the accident on the same railway line, on 18 March 1991 when three cattle were killed by the Heuston-Westport train at Bekan Bridge, I understand that the animals in question gained access to the railway line after they had strayed along a public road and then breached a fence near the railway bridge. <Col N="2195" /> However, no part of the train was derailed nor were any of the passengers injured.  In accordance with normal statutory requirements, my Department were notified of the accident.</P>

      <P>On 16 August 1988, a partnership comprising the two persons mentioned by the Deputy applied to my Department for a road freight carrier's licence.  Some essential information was not included with the application and, as repeated remainders failed to elicit the necessary information, the applicants were informed by my Department that if the outstanding material was not provided by a specified date, the application would be cancelled.  This was done on 18 September 1990.</P>
      <P>On 25 January 1991, one of the two persons concerned applied for a carrier's licence in his own right and International Road Freight Carrier's Licence No. 3124-91 was granted to him on 18 April 1991.</P>
