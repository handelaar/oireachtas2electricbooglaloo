The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, is reported to have said last night that he was concerned about the statement made by the Taoiseach in the Dáil here yesterday and that he was seeking a meeting with the Taoiseach to discuss, presumably, the future of the current Government.  Has such a meeting yet taken place, or when is it expected that such a meeting will take place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be guided by the Chair as to whether or not it is in order.  The second point I wanted to raise was the fact that yesterday my office was informed that the Taoiseach intended to make a personal statement to the House relating to the replies he gave in the House the week before.  We subsequently got information that in fact the Taoiseach had changed his mind and that he intended to reply to Private Notice Questions. On the other hand, we were told <Col N="2169" /> also that it is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle to decide whether or not questions are replied to in this House or are accepted in this House.  I want to know whether it was the Chair or the Taoiseach who decided that questions would be taken in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I put it to you that yesterday you were proposing to rule questions out of order on the basis that a personal statement was to be made and that in fact your final decision, which I believe to be the correct one, was that it was not in order to rule questions out on the basis that a personal statement was to be made and that it was on that basis that the Taoiseach decided not to go ahead with the statement because he was going to have to answer questions anyway.  Therefore his original plan to avoid answering supplementaries was aborted by your very proper decision.</P>

    <Title>Environmental Protection Agency Bill 1990  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on Thursday <Col N="2174" /> last I said that the Bill was long awaited and that I hoped the provisions would be implemented as quickly as possible but that I had serious reservations about the accountability of the agency when put in place.  I said that without accountability this agency would be open to a fair level of mistrust and I gave as an example the performance of An Bord Pleanála in recent times.</P>
      <P>My confidence in An Bord Pleanála is very low.  The label of being independent should not mean that it is not accountable. I hope there will be changes in this legislation on Committee Stage to ensure proper accountability on the part of the agency so that they will not be given a free rein to do what they like.  We need an agency, but far more important, we need a comprehensive national environmental policy.  We do not have one and we have seen recent examples where the lack of such a policy has caused considerable problems for industry here.</P>
      <P>The most recent was in Cork yesterday where a multi-national pound extension is being delayed at the possible cost of jobs because of objections from local groups.  I will not go into the rights and wrongs of that issue at present because it is a matter of appeal.  The point I am trying to make is that groups throughout the length and breadth of this country have no confidence in the authorities' ability to protect their rights, their livelihoods and their health.  They have no confidence in the local authorities and the other bodies that I outlined last week because these bodies have not the powers, the resources or the manpower to safeguard the rights of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that a proper agency be set up as quickly as possible.  Jobs are being lost because of the lack of a comprehensive environmental policy.  There is the example of the total lack of a national waste management policy.  We have a problem as to how we dispose of our toxic and chemical waste and our low level and high level nuclear waste from research institutions and hospitals.  We do not have a policy; we do not have a mechanism to dispose of this waste within <Col N="2175" /> our own territorial limits.  We are dependent on Britain to dispose of that waste and that dependency compromises us seriously in our attitude to Britain in relation to her nuclear disposal policy, be it on her own shores, or in the Irish Sea or the Atlantic.  We are totally compromised and much of the bravado and shooting from the hip of Ministers of the present Government when they were in opposition has been neutralised and stifled because they now see they are totally compromised when they approach Britain in relation to her nuclear policy.</P>
    <P>It is about time we got our act together and had a policy.  The most recent copout and the most recent example of an Irish solution to an Irish problem was the outrageous attitude of the Minister for the Environment, who is now hoping that the people of Derry and Du Pont will take care of our problems in relation to chemical and toxic waste.  It is a short-sighted, narrow <i>cul-de-sac</i> policy which is getting us nowhere.  It is about time that the relevant Ministers had the political guts to put a policy before this House and the people which would eliminate and resolve our problems.  What I am saying is that jobs are being lost daily because industrialists are refusing to come to this country because they are being left in the dark and are not being informed what they would be able to do with their chemical and toxic waste if they set up operations here.  This is costing us jobs daily.</P>
    <P>I hope that once the agency are set up not only will they have the legislative powers but the resources to implement many of these provisions.  We are a great country for making laws but we are very bad at implementing them.  I hope the resources will be made available to the local authorities and the agency to implement many of the provisions contained in the Bill.  Without the ability to implement and enforce the law it will become only a mockery and will be ignored.</P>
    <P>The state of the environment is extremely serious.  In spite of some <Col N="2176" /> improvements in certain areas the situation as a whole is continuing to deteriorate. It would be totally irresponsible of all of us to delay drastic action any longer. Radical decisions which will affect everyone are unavoidable.  The improvement of environmental quality and the very survival of mankind, long term, are at stake.  In recent times we have seen worrying statements in relation to the ozone layer.  Far reaching decisions which will affect everyone will have to be made. Even our behaviour in our own homes will have to be re-examined.  Unless we set a different course quickly and resolutely we are heading towards an environmental catastrophe.  The only way to avoid this is to lay a basis now for sustainable development, not only on a global basis but nationally.</P>
    <P>We must set out what resources we intend to apply to this struggle to give us a clean and safe environment.  It is no longer enough for the Government to make laws and regulations.  As I said already, we must have the resources to implement these laws and ensure that the people who would be affected by these laws comply with them.  There must be implementation of these laws and a positive active attitude on the part of everybody in this country in order to realise the objective of a clean environment.  No matter how well a policy is thought out and written down it must be implemented or else nothing will happen.  Here again I question the commitment of the Government in view of the inadequate allocations of resources made to date to the agencies in place to implement the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>All the hype about the Green Presidency, about which we heard so much some months ago and again during this debate, will come to nothing if financial resources are not made available to the agencies in place at present to implement the law.  I want to repeat again that I am amazed at the number of agencies dealing with the environment in place at present. There is an overlap, a disjointed effort, but major gaps and gross inefficiency also.  It is about time we got our act together.  Not only must there be a policy, <Col N="2177" /> there must be implementation of that policy as well as co-operation from all sectors of the community.  As I said already, there must be a national environmental policy, which we do not have to date.  Along with a policy there must be a will on the part of everybody to tackle the environmental issues affecting this country and the planet.  I would like to set out a number of the issues which must be tackled in the near future.</P>
    <P>There must be a target group policy to target different sectors of the community. For example, the agricultural sector, the personnel who deal with traffic control and transport, industry, the energy sector, the building trade and the local authorities must be targeted individually to ensure everyone is doing their bit and duty in relation to environmental control. We must get our research and educational institutions working even more efficiently on this issue.  They have made a major contribution so far to the small amount that has been done; but encouragement, especially financial encouragement, must be given to the research and educational institutions to tackle the problems which face us.</P>
    <P>The consumers, by which I mean all of us, are now an extremely important group.  We must, as consumers, take up the fight.  All aspects of society must be asked to make large efforts.  The environmental problems which face us today warrant this.  I would like to set out some of the goals which I would like to see met in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural community at present major improvments have been made in farm management despite the difficulties in Europe.  The use of agricultural fertilisers, new techniques and technology and pesticides has improved the output from our farmers; but the improvements have brought about an inherent risk.  We have seen during the past few years fish kills and pollution of our waterways.  In 1982, when I focused in on this issue I was accused by a local authority environmental officer of being alarmist.  I said the day would come when water supplies would be polluted seriously and lives would be put at risk, but <Col N="2178" /> I was told I was being alarmist.  That day has come.  We have seen serious pollution of our waterways in the months that have gone by and in recent weeks not too far away from here.  This is something we must tackle.</P>
    <P>The farming community have been very responsible and responsive to the challenge of the use of new technology in farming, but a greater effort must be made by Government agencies and everybody in the farming community to eliminate the risks which remain.  We must therefore set targets for the agricultural community to reduce ammonia emissions, there must be a balanced programme of fertilisation, a drop in the use of pesticides, encouragement for the agricultural community to set up environmentally friendly projects, an improvement in slurry management and, as I said, an intensification of research into sustainable natural agricultural methods.</P>
    <P>We must also focus in on this area in the transport sector because, with the growth in the urban sprawl which is so evident throughout our cities at present, the questions of travelling to work, mobility and the transportation of people and goods must be looked at and managed. The level of mobility has increased dramatically with the growth in the urban sprawl.  We must encourage the regeneration of our inner cities and encourage people to develop them even more.  This has happened in a small way.  On the one hand we are encouraging people to come back into our inner cities, but on the other we are driving them out with stupid, narrow short term policy decisions.  That is a matter for another day, but I ask the Government to focus in on the question of our inner cities and the environmental standards of our inner cities.</P>
    <P>There must be a major drive to make our inner cities more attractive for our people not only to work in but to live in.  We must look at the impact of road developments and infrastructure on the living conditions of people in our cities. The most recent example, which became a national issue, was the proposed road through the Middle Parish in Cork city. <Col N="2179" /> As in every dispute there are rights and wrongs on both sides but the most important consideration for any development such as that should be the people living there and, too often, those living in an area are thought of last.</P>
    <P>Another example is a local one in Cork, the major proposed project in the Blackpool area, a fly-over across a residential and shopping area, which will deface it.  In theory environmental impact studies are done but the mechanisms available for ordinary people to respond to these studies are almost nil.  They are given one month to respond to a technical complex document and, if they do not respond within that time, they have lost their chance.  Ordinary communities do not have the resources or the ability to get together a response to environmental impact studies in one month.  I ask for more flexibility for communities so that they can respond in a proper way, feel involved in decision-making and not just affected by it.  In Blackpool a study was done on the environmental impact which the project would have but, when the people in the area sought an extension of the time to submit a considered response, they were refused it which is very sad. Those people, at their own expense, had to get legal and technical advice and, to their credit, they did so.  The result of all this will mean delays, disputes recriminations and bitterness because, eventually, there will be a public inquiry involving greater costs to the Exchequer and greater trauma for everybody.  This could be avoided if there was a little bit of thought, consideration and flexibility and more important structures should be in place to deal with the needs of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>We had the issues of Blackpool, the Middle Parish and, yesterday, the matter of Schering Plough.  I am not saying who is right or wrong but the lack of structures is undermining the confidence of people in the authorities.  When confidence goes disputes arise.  That is the lesson of Merrell Dow and the lesson of many lost projects involving the loss of many jobs. <Col N="2180" /> I hope that this agency will bring confidence back to our community by protecting the people's interest and creating a balance between industrial development and environmental protection because, at present, that balance and confidence does not exist.  When dealing with the construction of roadways, we must take the landscape, the natural environment and the environment of the people living in the area into consideration.</P>
    <P>Traffic and transportation also account for an increasingly large share of consumption of energy and raw materials. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the following issues to be attended to. People must be advised, not only nationwide, but globally, to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons from cars, especially from commercial vehicles, over the next number of years.  We must control the increase in the emission of carbon monoxides and, as well as concentrating on the level of smog in Dublin, we must look at the levels of carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide in our cities and towns throughout the country.  I detect an air of complacency about the problem of smog in areas outside Dublin.  There is an increasing problem in that regard in Cork and other cities and we must tackle the issue before it becomes a major problem. I hope that the Government will initiate a policy which will encourage people to transfer from solid fuels to natural gas and other fuels which cause less pollution. It has been done in Dublin to an extent, I know that the Minister of State has a genuine interest in this matter which may not be matched by the resources at her disposal, but I ask her to consider that there is an increasing problem throughout the country and that local authorities do not have the financial resources or the technology to deal with it adequately.</P>
    <P>All passenger cars &mdash; this is not just a national issue but one for car manufacturers &mdash; should have a catalytic converter to reduce the level of emissions. Raw materials used by car manufacturers should be recyclable so that abandoned <Col N="2181" /> cars are not strewn all over the country. Structural decisions must be taken to reduce the need for mobility and issues in relation to urban renewal and inner city living must be tied in directly to environmental protection and control. There must be more encouragement for the use of bicycles; the small number of bicycle lanes show that people are actively discouraged, by the structure of our roads, from using bicycles.  Bicycle lanes must be set up in our towns and cities throughout the country and we must expand and improve bicycle routes.</P>
    <P>We made a major mistake many decades ago when we ran down the quality of our train services and closed many of our rail lines.  We are still doing it.  It was a short-sighted policy which drove articulated vehicles on to our roadways where as, if the railways had been kept open, they would have taken much of the pressure off the roads at present. Unfortunately, we have not learnt a lesson from the mistakes made in the fifties and sixties, we are still continuing to run down our rail lines.  For example, in relation to the Cork-Cobh line, one project says that it should be part of a major project for Cobh but, on the other hand, another agency is running down the train service there.  What will happen?  We will have more buses, trucks, cars and lorries choking our roads and polluting our environment when an efficient train service would help to reduce the problem.  There are many other examples, indeed our main line services are at present being run down. The whole policy of public transportation should be an environmental issue instead of being purely a transport problem. Efforts should be made to improve transportation, stimulate its use and get people more involved.  There should be a major campaign to encourage people to use public transport.  Tied in with that there should be development of our rail transport, but that is not happening.</P>
    <P>The whole industrial sector is the most important target group.  However, it is difficult to describe in a few words precisely what is expected from this group since numerous different companies are <Col N="2182" /> involved.  In broad outline what should be expected of each of them is that they thoroughly investigate the environmental aspects of their operations.  I appeal to industry to increase the level of internal inspection and examination of their operations from an environmental point of view.  Internal environmental concern should become an important pillar of industrial policy.  I suggest that the industries look at their levels of sulphur dioxide emissions.  There must be a reduction in emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. Our State companies are no angels in this regard.  I shall refer briefly to Moneypoint, the emissions from Moneypoint and environmental damage being done as a result.</P>
    <P>The emissions of phosphorus and nitrogen into surface water must be reduced.  As I said waste production must be reduced substantially by recycling and chemical treatment.  The waste management problem at present is the most important and vital issue that faces industry here.  What are we going to do with our industrial waste?  We do not have a policy to deal with it.  I am labouring the point, but we are hoping for an easy copout, that somebody else will take our waste.</P>
    <P>I mentioned previously the embarrassment I felt when I visited Sellafield three years ago.  Like Deputy Gerard Brady, I was critical of Windscale, now Sellafield, from the early eighties when it was not a political issue here.  When I visited that plant I was highly embarrassed when the management who took us to a treatment area some distance from the plant posed the question, if it were not for their operation what would we do with the nuclear waste from our hospitals, universities and research institutes?  He said that they were taking it because we did not have a facility to deal with it.  As a backbench Deputy, I felt very embarrassed and compromised when dealing with British Nuclear Fuels and the British Government on that visit. I wonder how embarrassed and compromised Government Ministers must be when dealing with that issue.  It is time we <Col N="2183" /> got our act together, behaved responsibly and courageously and set out a policy of waste management that will not allow cop-outs such as sending our waste to Derry or to areas outside the jurisdiction. We should deal with the issue within our own territorial limits, something that is not being done at present.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for the Environment on the one hand said &mdash; I could not believe what I heard &mdash; that waste management and the treatment of waste was being actively considered and options were being looked at &mdash; the usual departmental waffle &mdash; while on the other hand he said that Du Pont in Derry was an option.  It is an option but a cowardly one.  Let us be realistic and realise that in a few years' time we will be told by the European Community to solve our own waste management problems.  We will not be allowed export our waste to places outside our territorial limits.  It is time we set out our policies and made decisions so that we will not be running around like headless chickens in a few years' time when the European Community will force us to make decisions.</P>
    <P>The industrial sector, particularly the chemical industry, can play a major part in achieving many of these objectives. Not only is this a very large part of our industrial sector but it uses large quantities of hazardous substances.  I know that the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, whether through the pharmaceutical or chemical sectors, are doing their utmost to improve their operations on a daily basis, but their efforts are being undermined by a lack of structures and regulations.  We saw an example of that yesterday with the objection to the Schering Plough extension in Cork, a multimillion pound extension.  That company are beginning to lose heart, and their parent company will look elsewhere in future when considering developments or extensions of units in Europe.</P>
    <P>We must consider the whole question of industrial accidents involving hazardous chemicals.  I hope there will be greater emphasis on this matter.  In the energy sector we must achieve a further <Col N="2184" /> reduction in pollution as well as promoting energy conservation.  Important objectives should include a substantial reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions by power plants, such as Moneypoint, as well as a substantial reduction in nitrogen oxides.  There must be greater concern for environmental issues among our semi-State companies.  There must be a more intensive public relations campaign by these companies to distribute public information and give incentives to consumers to stimulate more energy consumption.</P>
    <P>The construction industry has a role to play in this regard because the building trade uses large quantities of raw materials, the reserves of which are inexhaustible.  These raw materials are taken from the ground at a cost to the environment.  How often do we see our countryside defaced by sandpits and quarrypits?  This has a major impact on nature and the landscape.  Therefore, the construction industry has a major impact on our environment by its choice of raw materials.  Greater research should be carried out in this regard.  The demolition of abandoned buildings generates waste which contributes to pollution of the environment.  For these reasons we need to focus more on the construction industry.</P>
    <P>We should attempt to double the recycling of construction and demolition waste.  We should replace materials whose recovery or use have serious environmental impacts.  There must be a greater increase in energy conservation in heating systems and construction quality must be improved by producing environmentally friendly products.  The Government have a major part to play because some State buildings are impositions on our landscape.  I refer to a building erected in Cork in recent years, the Government buildings on Sullivan's Quay.  This building is totally out of character with the surrounding area.  Consultation took place with the local authority and the building was erected without planning permission.  That building is a disgrace to any Government Department because it <Col N="2185" /> is totally out of character with the surrounding area.  That came about because of a defect in our planning laws which gives a free hand to Government projects. The Government therefore have a responsibility to ensure that new buildings blend in with and complement the surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>I have dealt adequately with the whole question of waste management, but I would ask the Minister &mdash; I acknowledge she has made an investment in recycling in certain areas &mdash; to put greater emphasis on the collection of recyclable waste and that greater encouragement, particularly financial incentives, be given to local authorities to upgrade their recycling programmes.  The recycling programme at local authority level is in its infancy.  It is not being developed because the local authorities do not have the resources even to collect and dispose of waste in landfill sites, so how can we then expect them to develop a recycling policy?</P>
    <P>The landfill sites throughout the country are a blot on our landscape.  The Cork landfill site, which has been in the news in recent times, is a terrible imposition on the surrounding area and is considered a serious health hazard and imposition on the quality of life of residents in the area.  There must be a greater emphasis on the management of sanitary landfills and there must be a shift from the policy of filling holes in the ground to a policy of recycling and of incinerating waste. We must look again at incineration.  I know that incineration of waste has its down side &mdash; I would have to question many of the incinerator operations, especially hospital incinerators &mdash; but I believe that properly controlled incineration can achieve a great deal.  In addition to disposing of the waste, the heat generated can be used.  Some years ago I visited Malmo in Sweden where they disposed of their waste by incineration and the heat generated by incineration was used to heat houses in the surrounding area.  It can have a twofold benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2186" /> The dumping of domestic and commercial waste must decrease considerably and greater emphasis must be placed on the disposal of waste by recycling, incineration and chemical treatments. In the long term all dumping sites must satisfy stringent environmental standards.  That is not being done at present because the local authorities do not have the resources to dispose of waste in a manner that will satisfy residents in these areas.  In fact the local authority in Cork are spending a great deal of money employing consultants to find a solution to bring the sanitary landfill site at Kinsale Road up to a standard that the residents wish and it is an uphill task.</P>
    <P>Structures must be improved in order to achieve our goal for the disposal of waste and therefore all local authorities must be involved in a big way in waste policy.  Research institutions such as our universities and colleges will have to pay more attention to projects aimed at environmentally friendly sustainable developments.  The development of systems of environmental concern will be an important part and, to be fair, our research and educational institutions are making a valiant effort to get involved in environmental projects.  They have to date made an important contribution to the environmental issue.  However, as I have said before, they are hindered by the lack of a waste management policy; indeed, waste has to be exported.</P>
    <P>Consumers are the biggest group and, in addition to the other target groups, we as consumers have a special role to play. Whoever acts in an environmentally friendly way at home is more likely to do so at work and in other areas.  For example, the public is expected to store all chemical waste, tin, glass, paper separately for waste collection and this must be done in conjunction with the local authorities.  Not only should the local authorities and recycling firms be involved but we must co-operate with them at a personal level.</P>
    <P>The consumption of electricity will have to decrease and we will have to drive our cars less and make greater use of public transport.  If we do not start to do <Col N="2187" /> this now we will be forced to do so in the years ahead.  Therefore it would be better to make a start now.  It will be a major challenge to get all sections of the community to work together.  The Government will have to face up to this task; otherwise we will be like the barbarians of old and will plunder the earth and our children and grandchildren will inherit this dreadful legacy.</P>
    <P>The message that this earth is not our property must be put across clearly.  We have a loan of this earth and we have the responsibility not only to pass it on as good as we got it but to face the challenge of improving it.  There are abundant opportunities for sustainable development. The Government must give the lead, so we must have daring creativity and the will to take advantage of the goodwill that exists for the environment at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in broad outline, but I have serious reservations about the lack of accountability of the proposed agency.  I would compare it with An Bord Pleanála, an independent body, who are not held accountable for their actions. We have seen too much of what this lack of accountability can lead to in recent times.  My party will be tabling amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage so that the elected Members and those who elected them will have a say in the management of our environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill also, but it is long overdue.  It will require a great deal of research and expenditure to implement the provisions of the Bill. At this stage I would like to compliment the Minister of State and the Department of the Environment on their efforts to protect the environment.  As I said previously, it will require heavy expenditure from both the State and the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to develop tourism, especially at a time when it is one of the few real options for the small and medium sized farmer with the present restrictions on the traditional areas of production, meat and milk, we need to promote a friendly <Col N="2188" /> environment.  Pollution originates from four main sources &mdash; commercial and agricultural enterprises, the local authorities and the private sector.  One would have to say that our environment was neglected in the seventies and eighties with the intensification of production and the increased use of fertilisers.  The watercourses, rivers and lakes were greatly polluted.  However, we have to admit that over the past number of years we have made a terrific improvement, and nothing contributed more to this than the measures introduced by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, in 1989 when he introduced anti-pollution grants.  Substantial grant aid of as much as 55 per cent of cost was given for underground slurry tanks in cattle yards and sheds.  The water quality in all areas has been improved greatly as a result.  Fish kills, too, have reduced substantially during the past several years, despite criticism of them.  I believe that the introduction of those anti-pollution measures was a great breakthrough. None of us from rural areas could ever have anticipated when those grants become available that such a good take-up would have occurred or that such a responsible position would be taken by farmers and industries.  The grants have resulted in great improvements.</P>
    <P>Commercial plants have been criticised for emissions into streams but it has to be realised that plants for the slaughter of cattle, pigs or poultry especially have a real problem because of the amount of waste generated.  Co-ops also face the problem of much waste being created from the run-off from milk and so on. The treatment and control of waste is a high annual cost for those plants.  Many plants &mdash; there are several of them in my own county &mdash; had to purchase farms of substantial size so that treated waste could be pumped and sprayed across the land and run-off from the plants could be absorbed into the soil.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have also been criticised, but an amazing amount of money has been provided for several years for sewage treatment plants, for extensions to them and for water schemes.  The <Col N="2189" /> amount spent on sewerage works by any county would far exceed the amount provided for road structures, which are so essential and about which there is so much talk.  No mention is made about the millions of pounds that are being provided for and used to improve local authority sewerage plants and without which hardly any town or village in the country would have had a sewerage system that was not obsolete and did not require massive expenditure for newly constructed sewerage plants.</P>
    <P>Problems are caused for the private sector too.  Septic tanks can cause many difficulties and their structures deteriorate with the passage of years.  There again much expenditure is incurred and much responsibility is shown with the checks that are kept by health inspectors. I pay tribute to health inspectors for the work they have done on the domestic scene as well as in the industrial and agricultural sectors.</P>
    <P>The greatest concern has to be shown our water sources to ensure that they are kept pollution free.  Many years ago there was little to be said in this country about the good supply of quality water. However, that has deteriorated and now, for various reasons, our water supplies face real problems.  Most towns and areas are dependent on open water sources. Some open water sources have fairly large catchment areas and often nitrates from farmland have found their way into those water sources.</P>
    <P>Much research and survey work has been done on underground sources and aquafers.  Deep well drilling and aquafers, the underground supplies of water, seem to be the best way to go towards the provision of quality water. There is great need for quality water in a country that places so much emphasis on the food industry and food production. Quality water is needed in our co-ops for milk production and on our farms for both the cleaning of equipment and the cooling of milk.  Good work has been done but a lot more could be done. There is need for much research.  When the EC draft directive on nitrates comes into operation, the Minister should set <Col N="2190" /> up pilot schemes in particular areas that have problems with regard to water supplies so that close examination can be undertaken.  Now that EC funding is available it behoves us to make the best possible use of it to improve water supplies.</P>
    <P>Every speaker on this debate has his or her own problem areas in relation to waste disposal and anti-pollution measures.  We have heard about the problems in Cork and similar statements could come from representatives of different parts of the country.  We in the north-east region have our own problems. It is an area that has intense production in both the poultry and mushroom industries.  Both industries create massive tonnages of waste.  The poultry industry alone in a small portion of Louth, east Cavan and primarily the northern part of County Monaghan, where I come from, generate 120,000 tonnes of dry litter a year.  Then there is extra litter from layers, which has a different impact.  Luckily, the mushroom industry absorbs about 50,000 tonnes of the 120,000 tonnes of dry litter, but 70,000 tonnes remain.  There was no problem with that remainder this year because we had a dry year, the land was dry and the litter could be spread on it. However, in the wet years &mdash; even last Christmas and in the spring &mdash; there is a real problem concerning the storage and then the dumping of the waste.  It is reckoned that about two million bags of waste mushroom compost is produced each year.  In my own part of County Monaghan the mushroom industry generate something like 3,500 tonnes of waste compost a week, a very big tonnage. Because that compost is in plastic bags it is not suitable for spreading on farmland, and most of it is dumped in disused quarries, old bogs and old wasteland. That could present a serious problem for the future.</P>
    <P>In the past couple of years, and especially in the past 12 months, I have been in touch with various Departments but I have been disappointed at the general reaction I received because their attitude is to pass the problem over to <Col N="2191" /> somebody else.  I have been in touch with the Department of Energy on behalf of an entrepreneur who wanted to set up a plant that would burn the litter and generate electricity.  Tests on that area had been carried out in other countries and it was reckoned that the litter would amount to 50 per cent of the value of solid fuel.  I had discussion with the Minister for Energy who recommended that I contact the ESB in this matter.  There the problem was that, unless highly subsidised, the price they would pay for electricity generated outside their stations would not be economic.  In County Monaghan we have one small plant generating electricity to provide heat for growing mushrooms and tomatoes, a succesful enterprise in recent years.</P>
    <P>In Britain the Department of Defence devised a scheme under which the type of waste and litter is utilised, this involves massive tonnage.  Such a scheme should be examined with a view to implementation here.  I tabled a number of parliamentary questions requesting the Department of Energy, Agriculture and Food, Tourism and Transport and Communications and so on, to co-ordinate their efforts to ascertain what could be done in this area.  I know each has been undertaken on the usage of compost and litter in order to produce a viable garden compost.  We must remember since this is a fertiliser as well as a compost it must have potential.  The Department will have to provide additional assistance to ensure that such matters receive attention.</P>
    <P>There was reference to refuse dumps and waste management, the most serious problems confronting local authorities at present.  A survey was undertaken some years ago on indiscriminate dumping when it was discovered that there were 55 unofficial dumps throughout the country. There was a clamp down on such unofficial dumps leading to a substantial improvement in the overall position. Nonetheless people continue to be irresponsible. By that I mean people tend to put plastic bags containing any type of waste in the boots of their cars then drive <Col N="2192" /> at night to dump them into a bog or field. That is a disgusting practice.</P>
    <P>Local authorities experience considerable difficulties in the mangement and maintenance of dumps and in securing land for such dumps in that it is becoming ever more difficult to get people to make land available, even poor quality land, for a dump site.  It must be remembered also that, if one is to adhere to EC rules and regulations, massive tonnages of soil must be moved for this purpose.</P>
    <P>There will have to be a partial recycling of much of that dumped waste where paper, cardboard and so on is kept.  There was a small industry in my county some years ago that used such material as a fuel, being made into something similar to a compressed Bord na Móna briquette, a slow burning fuel.  However, it turned out not be an economic proposition.  That leads one to believe that if there were grant aid or assistance given, people engaged in that type of business, in all probability, would be successful because the material is there.</P>
    <P>Representatives of any local authorities will tell you that one of the greatest problems they encountered was the disposal of plastic bags and tetrapack milk containers which, I believe, are very difficult to burn.  In addition, it is my belief that, in any one county, one would be talking about the disposal of approximately 50,000 to 60,000 such containers per day.  Therefore, it will be readily seen that, when commercial enterprises change their systems packaging and/or disposal, this can cause enormous problems for local authorities, particularly in the disposal of containers they may have introduced without prior consultation with local authorities.</P>
    <P>In the area I represent there is enormous concern about that type of waste. When one of those EC cross-Border initiatives was introduced it was our belief that such programme would facilitate joint cross-Border schemes in that there were mushrooms growing either side of the Border in north Monaghan, particularly in a substantial way in the Armagh region.  In that connection I contacted <Col N="2193" /> the powers that be requesting them to consider funding for the establishment of plants, whether for the generation of electricity or the production of compost or some other product in order to utilise such waste materials.  In August last when the joint INTERREG programme for North and South was approved, it had the blessing of the EC.  That programme incorporated a number of anti-pollution measures, especially those relating to the quality of water.  In the Lough Foyle catchment area there was a 75 per cent grant allocated for that purpose, the highest grant provided for anti-pollution measures, with the exception of those granted for afforestation.  In the Lough Foyle estuary there was a proposed expenditure of 1.5 million ECUs, representing approximately £1.25 million, that is, on part of the South and Northern Ireland.  Of course, that is one of the foremost salmon fishing regions in the area.  On the east coast something over £6.8 million has been spent improving the quality of water in Lough Neagh.  In our area we have made strong representations to the respective Departments to undertake research into the quality of such waters.</P>
    <P>My fear is that the working parties of civil servants engaged in the implementation of anti-pollution measures funded by EC Structural Funds, by the INTERREG or Leader programmes have some objective in mind, whether that be a specific development <i>vis-á-vis</i> tourism or some other project and it is very difficult to get them to move away from such objective.  The time has come when members of local authorities must have more input into meetings of such working parties when EC funding is being provided so that they will be able to exert their influence to the benefit of their respective areas.  Deputy McGahon must be as disappointed as I that such funding initially appears substantial but, within a short period, one is told it has all been expended with meagre benefits only visible on the ground.  That is one matter that concerns me greatly.</P>
    <P>We public representatives are concerned in that we cannot object to the <Col N="2194" /> imposition of penalties or adherence to strict monitoring and so on when many farmers and industrialists making great efforts to get their act together, involving huge expenditure, find themselves prematurely before the courts facing severe penalties.  There should be recognition of the efforts made by such people and it is a real pity that more consideration is not given to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on this much publicised and long overdue Bill.  The Labour Party will seek to strengthen substantially the proposed Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that it will be truly representative and that it will have wide-ranging terms of reference and the powers to carry out its function effectively.  This agency must remain fully accountable to the general public at all stages and fully independent of all vested interests.  In the current climate it is more important than ever that the agency should be impartial in every way.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State for her handling of the Bill in the Seanad where she was prepared to accept amendments submitted by Opposition Senators. I hope she will be in the same frame of mind during the Bill's passage through this House.  This is the way to deal with complex and wide-ranging legislation.</P>
      <P>I refer to section 106 of the Bill.  Subsection (4) states that this section shall not apply to noise caused by aircraft.  This is a scandalous and deliberate omission, particularly as there are no legislative provisions governing this environmental problem, which has been acknowledged by medical experts throughout the world as a danger to health.  This fact has not been acknowledged by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I attended a conference on Irish transport.  Mr. Neil Gleeson, the managing director of IATA, outlined the major problems in the aviation industry, particularly in America, where in the years 1978-90 there were 269 carriers and where today there are 73 carriers.  Notwithstanding those difficulties, it is acknowledged by the aviation industry worldwide that a noise pollution problem <Col N="2195" /> exists and it is being addressed in the EC and elsewhere.  I am concerned, however, that it has not been included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Civil aviation is acknowledged as one of the most dynamic industries and it is no surprise that the development of airports is having a dramatic effect on local communities.  There are two sides to this.  On the positive side industries have mushroomed around airports, with the creation of thousands of new jobs.  In excess of 8,000 people are employed in the general area of Dublin Airport.  I acknowledge the benefits of the airport to the country as a whole and particularly to north County Dublin and I look forward to further expansion in the years to come.</P>
    <P>It must also be stressed, however, that the aviation industry causes enormous disturbances when an airport is located within or near a village, town or city.  The noise pollution caused by aircraft is a major problem for local residents, because in Ireland there are no maximum noise limits and no laws to protect residents or to compensate them for the cost of necessary insulation works.  A major problem exists in my constituency.  The village of St. Margaret's, once known as the quietest village in Ireland, and surrounding areas have been very badly affected by noise pollution as a consequence of the construction of the new runway at Dublin Airport.  Having visited many of the affected homes I have witnessed effects on residents.  These include the limited use of telephones, televisions and radios during the course of the day, disruptions of conversation, effects on children's concentration and on study, damage to various houses, a fall in the valuation of property and general stress and health problems.</P>
    <P>An impasse has existed for the past two years between the residents and Aer Rianta regarding the degree of insulation required in the dwellings in question.  In view of the total lack of legislation in this field, Aer Rianta have been empowered by the Minister for Tourism and Transport to come to a reasonable agreement <Col N="2196" /> with the residents.  In effect, the Minister has passed the ball to Aer Rianta.  It is unacceptable that the Minister should ask public servants, who are indirectly the noise polluters in this instance and who will ultimately have to finance the scheme, to resolve the problem on his behalf.  It is only reasonable to assume that they would be looking over their shoulders at the Minister, particularly as they would be setting precedents for other areas as well.  There are no precedents in this area at present and they would be looking to Shannon Airport and other regional airports to set these.</P>
    <P>It is precisely for this reason that I believe it is time for a truly independent body to be appointed to assess disturbances caused by aircraft noise and to advise and recommend on the protection of the environment around airports.  The proposed Environmental Protection Agency should be that body.  The Minister may not be prepared to accept my suggestion, but I hope she will.  If she does not accept it I would ask her to outline why this should not be the case.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency should also look at the system of noise measurement generally around airports. They could act as an umbrella body who would appoint a competent group of people to assess our present noise measurement system and the problems caused by noise.  A system which has been used for many years by Aer Rianta and airports in other countries is the NNI system, the noise and number index system.  It is true to say that there has been international criticism of the NNI system, particularly by groups who have experienced some of the more unusual combinations of work and noise factors. Furthermore, international calls have been made for the replacement of the NNI system.  Aer Rianta have basically said that homes within the 50 NNI contours area should be entitled to compensation or insulation grants.  Many of the people I have visited in Turnapin, The Baskin, Rivermead, Killeek Lane, <Col N="2197" /> the North Road and rural areas in Mulhuddart believe they have been discriminated against.  Having listened to the noise of these aircraft I believe they have a case which needs to be answered. Property in some of those areas has been damaged and glass has fallen out of windows because of the noise level of aircraft.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked: who should pay for an adequate insulation system?  During the oil crisis surcharges were imposed by airlines on passengers. In the interests of the general public and the people residing in these areas it should be possible to increase landing charges &mdash; I am talking in terms of pennies &mdash; to cover the cost of insulation grants which would give peace of mind back to the residents and communities in these areas.  In order to ensure that Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta are not discriminated against in any way, a policy should be implemented across the board at EC level in this area.  I would ask the Government to look seriously at this issue.</P>
    <P>It is my sincere wish &mdash; I hope the Minister will convey my wishes to the Government &mdash; that the ongoing dispute between the people of St. Margaret's and Aer Rianta can be resolved.  Eolas have been invited to become involved in the dispute.  I know they have indicated an interest in this dispute and that they are working on this at present.  The cases put forward by Aer Lingus and the residents should be investigated and Eolas should be given the power by the Government to make recommendations in this area. It is important that an independent organisation such as Eolas would put forward recommendations on what improvements, if any, are required. Hopefully, this can be done, so that the people of that area can live in harmony together and the signs referred to Aer Lingus as a bad neighbour can be removed.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy who represents a constituency which is near the coast another area of concern to me is the pollution of the Irish Sea.  In this regard there is a clear overlap between international and <Col N="2198" /> domestic concerns.  The Irish Sea has become one of the most radioactive seas in the world.  This has been caused substantially by discharges from Sellafield. The growth in the amount of nuclear waste products being sent to the Sellafield reprocessing plant poses an ever increasing risk to the Irish Sea.  This traffic is set to increase with the threatened expansion of Sellafield to include a nuclear waste dump.  I hope the Environmental Protection Agency will highlight our concerns in this area so that action will be taken.</P>
    <P>I want to say very clearly that both this Government and the previous Government failed the Irish people in their attitude to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Both Governments made many promises about the action they would ask the British Government to take in relation to Sellafield.  The then Minister, Deputy Burke, stated very clearly at that time that he would be prepared to bring the British Government before the European Court of Justice.  However, this has not happened.  I now call on the British Government to reject the proposals for the expansion of the Sellafield reprocessing plant to include a nuclear waste storage facility, to take the wishes of the Irish people and Government into account and to close down this plant.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea is also increasingly at risk from the activities of nuclear powered and armed submarines which constantly traverse its waters.  This activity must be monitored.  I hope the new agency will have a role in this area, if for no other reason than to protect fishing vessels and their crews.  Many of these vessels have been damaged and there has been some loss of life.  People in my constituency who have lost their boats have had their future put at risk.  Many of these people are now unemployed and they have no recourse to the law, either nationally or internationally, to seek compensation which would enable them to purchase new trawlers and so get back into business. I know people who have had to emigrate because of this problem.  On those occasions the Government washed their hands of it, saying it was not their <Col N="2199" /> problem, but rather it was a civil matter. We all are aware and the Government are aware that submarines are using the central channel but, unfortunately, we have not been able to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The condition of the Irish Sea cannot be blamed 100 per cent on Sellafield as there are substantial toxic discharges coming from various points along the Irish coastline.  The state of our beaches cannot be blamed on someone else.  Even today, with our knowledge of the dangers for such actions we are still pumping raw sewage onto our beaches.  It is important in the context of this Bill that we have a unity of purpose with the Government on the need to deal with our environment. There is little use in passing this Bill if the Government are not prepared to deal with the problem.  It is vital that the upgrading of effluent treatment and disposal plants is given a high priority.  It is important that a close relationship exist at all stages with the Department of the Environment and the agency when it is established.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is an urgent need for new treatment plants for the towns of Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk and Loughshinny.  Those towns have been identified by the council in correspondence to the Department. Indeed, I received numerous complaints regarding the untreated discharge of sewage from the existing overloaded systems in many of those areas.  In this context I noted with concern a letter from the Department of the Environment, dated 27 February, to Dublin County Council which stated that the Department are restricting capital expenditure for new schemes discharging into coastal waters from urban areas representing 10,000 of a population equivalent or more.  What is to be done for towns with a population of less than 10,000?  Are we saying that because they have a population of less than 10,000 they will have to wait?  Will untreated sewage continue to be dumped into the Irish Sea?  How long can those towns wait for a proper system?  The laying of a long pipe into the Irish Sea can no longer be regarded as <Col N="2200" /> a solution.  We need secondary treatment facilities in those areas if we are to encourage people to use our waters for recreational purposes and improve our environment.  I demand, in the interests of the general public and our environment, that this regulation should not prevent medium-sized towns from securing their much needed full secondary treatment facilities.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wildbird Conservancy has been concerned for a number of years with the operations of Balleally tiphead at Rogerstown estuary.  This estuary is frequented by many wading birds and wild fowl in winter, and, in recognition of its importance, it has been given national nature reserve status.  The Irish Wildbird Conservancy produced a report on the conservation of the estuary for wildlife in August 1990, which was circulated to all authorities involved including the various Departments and Dublin County Council. Balleally tiphead is licensed to receive domestic and non-toxic industrial waste. However, this waste does contain toxic substances, particularly heavy metals. Studies by the environmental science unit of Trinity College have shown that the mud in the estuary is contaminated with cadmium, lead and copper and that these toxic metals come from the tiphead. There is no physical barrier to stop the leachate from entering the estuary, where it is absorbed by mud and by the plants and animals in the estuary.</P>
    <P>In view of this it is vital that Dublin County Council install a leachate containment system as a matter of priority. That should be a general principle of the agency and the Government.  At present there is only one leachate containment system in the Twenty-six Counties. Dublin County Council could recoup the cost by collecting landfill gas which could be sold.  The technology for installing such a system is readily available.  The Environmental Protection Agency should be to the forefront in recommending that all landfill sites be provided with a leachate containment system.  If that facility was provided we would not have the European Commission deciding to commence proceedings against Ireland <Col N="2201" /> for alleged infringements of EC Directives 75/442 EC on Waste, 85/337 EC on Environmental Impact Assessment and 79/409 EC on the Conservation of Wild Birds.  These proceedings refer to Balleally. This is why it is important that action be taken.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to public transport and the interaction between the need for proper public transport and the environment generally.  In Dublin traffic congestion has reached terminal proportions. This has been brought about by a pre-occupation with providing for private cars over decades, combined with a failure by various Governments to develop a proper public transport alternative system.  This is having a major impact on our environment and is creating social and economic problems in our city.  We cannot have independent groups or Departments working on their own.  There must be an overall policy to improve the environment and that does not exist at present.  We should seriously consider the need for adequate public transport.  The Labour Party hope to see a light rail transport system being established in Dublin.  At the moment every morning in Dublin people are faced with traffic congestion, pollution and so on. When one considers that one bus has the equivalent capacity of 30 cars and when one considers the savings that could be made in fuel consumption and so on, it is a scandal that the Government have failed miserably to invest adequately in public transport.  The Government programme for 1989 to 1993 shows a projected investment in roads of £615 million as against a projected investment of £36 million in public transport.  Where is the commitment to the environment in a policy like that and where is our commitment to public transport?  Ministers indicate that they are in favour of developing public transport and later indicate that they are in favour of private transport.  The investment figures projected for transport and for roads shows a ratio of 17:1 in favour of roads.</P>
    <P>One can only be encouraged by the extent and condition of public transport in Europe.  In Germany in 1987 the ratio <Col N="2202" /> of investment in roads and public transport was 4:1 in favour of roads and was dropping.  The same thing is occurring in France and in most other European countries.  They see the necessity for an efficient public transport system.  If we provide the infrastructure people will leave their cars at home and will use public transport.  The advent of the DART system has brought about a 30 per cent increase in public transport use in that area.  The DART has provided an economic advantage along its route in that the value of property has increased. Such a system provides a boost for an area, although one must question why the commitment was given to that area. I hope the Minister will recognise that the contents of this Bill can be linked with an overall policy covering all these areas.</P>
    <P>As a coastal constituency representative I am conscious of the need for greater public awareness in relation to litter.  I know the Minister is concerned about this and has provided finance for various schemes to improve coastline environments.  The Environmental Protection Agency should be in a position to actively encourage development in this area.  It would not require much money. With the expenditure of small amounts of money we could create a greater awareness among the public, and local authorities could also make a commitment to improve.  We should expand clean-up activities, especially at weekends and during bank holidays.  Seaside towns anywhere in Ireland but particularly in the greater Dublin area are inundated with litter at weekends, particularly bank holiday weekends. Litter bins are too small or they are not being emptied frequently enough.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the fact that the manager and staff of Dublin County Council have responded to the needs from their limited financial resource.  However, they can only work on the basis of the finance available.  If the finance is not available, or if it is not directed in a particular way by Government, many schemes to improve the environment cannot be implemented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2203" /> This year £1 million has been provided to get the agency up and running, but I wonder if that commitment will be sustained on the basis of what we know about future constraints in relation to the economy generally and the further cutbacks that are in the offing.</P>
    <P>In an effort to improve, we should modify our litter bin designs and we should implement more frequent emptying of litter bins.  That would not cost a lot of money.  I know, for instance, that county council workers work on the Saturday morning of a bank holiday, but the council only have the resources to employ them until 12 o'clock.  To create greater awareness we should put more &ldquo;Bring your litter home&rdquo; signs at intervals along beaches.  People are more aware of the environment and we should encourage that awareness by doing this.</P>
    <P>We must address the problem relating to plastic materials.  There is a need for greater reduction in the use of plastic and for the provision of bio-degradable alternatives.  While I am on the subject of beaches and the environment generally, I would like to record the need for the provision of public toilets on or adjacent to our beaches.  It is scandalous that in Portrane, for instance, a seaside town in my area, for the last six years there has not been a public toilet in the area.  It is scandalous that people should have to be under a compliment to, for instance, the local publican for the use of a toilet, especially in a seaside town which has secured a blue flag.  A directive should go from the agency to the various local authorities to ensure that a commitment is made to the provision of public toilets in popular seaside villages and towns.  If we are to facilitate these minimal improvements we need further resources.  I hope the Minister will make commitments in this area.  A central theme of environment protection is planning. A socially just environment cannot be achieved without proper planning.  I see a role for the agency here.</P>
    <P>The absence of proper planning in our society over many years has resulted in massive suburban sprawl around our <Col N="2204" /> major towns and cities with a consequent decline and running down of the inner city areas with its devastating effect on the environment.  This suburban sprawl is frequently ugly, badly serviced with community facilities, unevenly developed and totally without an efficient system of public transport.</P>
    <P>Our population is currently growing faster than any other in western Europe. In addition we are still urbanising.  Given this great pressure of growth, the environment is now at risk from potentially damaging development.  In addition, because of our social system and inadequate planning machinery, our community is at full risk from unscrupulous developers, concerned only with exploiting communities for their private gain.  I have to say here that, on the basis of some of the most recent legislation, there are fewer cowboys out there and it should be our policy to weed out the remainder in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal briefly with the role of the local authorities in monitoring atmospheric emissions and discharges into our water courses.  Sections 66 and 67 deal with this area.  There is a much greater awareness among the public nowadays of emissions and discharges particularly from factories and industry.  There must be a balance between the need for industry and jobs and protection of the environment at large.  Various concerns have been raised by people who see emissions into the atmosphere and discharges into waterways.  Complaints have been made to the local authorities and to the factories concerned but there was no follow up.  There was a lack of information. There was not consultation and many of the concerns could be dealt with if there was more consultation.  In many cases there seems to have been a screen of secrecy in respect of some of the complaints and some of the information.  I hope the agency being set up under this Bill will ensure that local authorities will continue to monitor the system and set up a mechanism whereby local concerned people could have access to information. Above all, they should have the resources <Col N="2205" /> at their disposal to ensure that this monitoring can take place.</P>
    <P>I have been made aware that in some cases lack of resources has restricted the type of monitoring that is required.  That is not good enough.  If we are committed in this area and want to encourage the participation of the general public then these areas must be dealt with.  Section 65 of the Bill, for example, states that the agency shall exercise general supervision over the monitoring carried out by local authorities and such other public authorities as may be prescribed for the purpose of any enactment in relating to environmental protection.  I am delighted to see that incorporated in the Bill.  I hope it can be acted upon and that there will be no problem with regard to the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>Basically we welcome the Bill.  We believe that the natural environment is a basic resource held in trust by this generation. The environment extends from our coastal zone, overland, to include deposits of natural resources as well as the air we breath.  We have learned in the past decades that the environment can be easily damaged and its ecological balance disturbed with a consequent threat to life.  To date our knowledge of how our environment functions is limited.  In order to manage our environment sensibly and responsibly on behalf of the community, it is essential that we considerably expand our knowledge of the environment and improve our monitoring systems.</P>
    <P>This Bill goes some way towards redressing some of the problems.  We in the Labour Party look forward to submitting amendments that will further strengthen the Bill.  As I said earlier, I hope the Ministry and the Government will look in a positive manner at the proposals submitted by the Opposition and, hopefully, we can send forward a Bill that will be worthy of this Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  I believe it to be a positive step which will bring about great cohesion, co-ordination and integration with regard to the whole environmental process.  I <Col N="2206" /> would hope that there will be a consistency in our approach from now on with regard to the problems that face our environment and the future protection of our environment.</P>
      <P>I believe this Bill will have the financial teeth to tackle pollution.  I am also glad to see from a practical point of view that the maximum use will be made of the existing facilities, whether at local, regional or national level, deal with the particular problems.  I am glad to see that the local region, the local authorities and the agency will be working hand in glove to deal with the problems that exist.</P>
      <P>This agency will be an independent agency.  This matter has been raised by many people.  Naturally people would be anxious to see that such an agency would be independent of Government, independent of Ministers.  Indeed, we feel that it is important that this transparency should be evident and because of the way it is proposed to set up this agency, I believe it will be professional, it will be an agency with integrity and it will be independent.</P>
      <P>The one problem I see is the right of appeal.  This view has been expressed by a number of people.  I believe that having the only recourse to appeal in the High Court, might, because of the cost, mitigate against the individual or the smaller groups.  The multinationals, perhaps, will be in a very different position and will be able to bring their case to the High Court. However, because of the costs involved it will be very different for the individual or for the smaller group because naturally they will not have the same financial backing as the larger groups and the multinationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see too &mdash; and it is a very positive step &mdash; that this Bill is being welcomed by the Confederation of Irish Industry and by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  What we all want to see is a balance between industrial expansion and the protection of our environment and, as we have seen from the experiences in the United States and in other European countries, it has been particularly difficult to find this balance.  We have to attempt to find it.  I would not be <Col N="2207" /> too happy with some of the American solutions in this regard, but I hope in our own legislation we will find that happy balance.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry are very anxious that due consideration will be given, in setting charges for licences and services to fund the agency, to the question of the competitiveness of Irish industry.  That would be a very sensible approach and it is one which I am sure, the Minister and the Government will consider adopting.</P>
    <P>In a recent article Mr. Frank Popoff, the president and chief executive of the Dow Chemical Corporation, said that the one issue above all else which will affect Dow's prospects in the nineties and beyond is the question of environmental protection.  Any companies, in particular chemical companies, who fail to address the issue of the importance of the environment will, in his view, face extinction. The question of their responsibility to protect the environment will be particularly challenging for chemical companies during the next few years.  I think they would be the first to realise that their press has been anything but positive or good and that they have an awful lot of work to do if they are to convince legislators and the general public that their industry are working to protect the environment as well as being in a position to give much needed jobs and employment.</P>
    <P>I would be very interested to hear the Minister's view on the programme called &ldquo;Responsible Care&rdquo; which I understand has been implemented in the United States, Canada, Australia and several European countries.  I would be interested in seeing how this could be implemented in our own legislation or encouraged &mdash; obviously on a much smaller scale.  I would also be interested to hear what the Minister would have to say on the recent positive initiative, known as the business charter for substantial development, taken by the International Chamber of Commerce.  It would be interesting to see if some of those ideas could be implemented to strengthen our <Col N="2208" /> view of environmental policy.  I do not want to sound too cynical but the chemical companies to which I referred earlier are obviously trying to get a better press through the Responsible Care programme and other initiatives.  I should say however that these initiatives do not originate necessarily from any altruistic motives, but whatever the motives they should be encouraged and promoted.</P>
    <P>When talking about industrial development and the need to provide jobs it is very important to ensure that we live off the earth's interest and not its capital, thereby protecting jobs in the tourism sector and other spin-off industries, for example, while at the same time protecting the health and welfare of our citizens. Obviously the questions of providing jobs, particularly in the industrial sector, and of environmental protection are interlinked, which brings us back to the essential problem of striking a balance to make sure both can be protected.</P>
    <P>Let me make a brief reference to the question of pollution in the agricultural sector.  I listened carefully to my colleague, Deputy Leonard, who made specific reference to the problems facing the agricultural industry with regard to pollution.  Like Deputy Leonard, I would like to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food for taking the initiative and introducing a grants scheme to prevent pollution in the agricultural sector.  These grants were very much needed.  As Deputy Leonard said, not only was this grants scheme acceptable but the farming community were encouraged to take them up, as shown by the number of grants taken up.  These were very handsome grants and farmers were thankful for the foresight of the Minister in initiating this grants scheme long before any legislation, such as the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, was put into effect.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in what the last Opposition speaker had to say about roads and railways and the pollution emanating from traffic on our roads.  I find it very difficult to understand some <Col N="2209" /> of the arguments being put forward at present by Iarnród Éireann in my own constituency of County Clare where the Ennis railway station is under threat. Iarnród Éireann have said that in the case of some services passengers will be taken by road from Limerick to Ennis.  If we are serious about trying to promote an area and making the best use of existing facilities I do not think the answer is to put more trucks and traffic on our roads when a railway station is already in existence. Further use should be made of the infrastructure already in place rather than causing other problems, which perhaps are yet unseen, on our roads.</P>
    <P>Very often we in Ireland are accused of reacting to certain problems only when Directives are issued by the European Community.  We are not the only country however to react to such encouragement. It is very interesting to note that some years ago public concern forced a response in America where the super fund legislation was introduced and that the dramatic London smog in 1953 led to the Clean Air Act, 1956.  Furthermore, Britain's Environmental Protection Act was only initiated in 1990.  I am glad to say therefore that we are up there with many other European countries and perhaps are ahead of some in that we feel that these problems are sufficiently important to deal with them in legislation. We look forward to improvements in our environment.</P>
    <P>With regard to EC legislation, Articles 130R and 130T of the EC Treaty fix the rules for Community action in environmental matters.  The European community has already issued 280 legally binding environmental measures and many more are proposed.  It is interesting to note that the European Community has been influenced by the United States in enshrining the &ldquo;polluter must pay&rdquo; principle, which is incorporated in the Single European Act.  The European Community environmental policy has two main objectives: (1) to promote and improve the quality of the environment in order to protect human health and (2) to ensure prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2210" /> Not all member states have a coherent and consistent environmental policy.  The commission has had therefore to initiate a number of regulations and directives on access to information, air emissions from large combustion plants, the marketing of new chemical substances and the prevention of major accidents in industrial activities.  The European Parliament has requested a Community wide pollution police or inspectorate.  Again, I would very much like to hear what the Minister's views on this proposal are.  I would also like to know if it is likely that this question will be raised at Council level and, if so, what our response will be on that issue.</P>
    <P>Let me return to the pollution must -pay principle.  This was first formulated by the OECD in the early seventies. The perceived benefit of this principle is that if the pollution results in great expense the polluter will attempt at least to lessen the offence.  In the recent German pollution control law, effective since 1 January 1991, the onus is on the company to prove their innocence.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify how the EC Directive will influence the performance of the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to strict civil liabilities for damage caused by wastes. The European Parliament and the Commission have locked horns on this issue and it has not proved successful in the United States.  I should also like to know whether the precautionary principle influenced the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>One of the very positive aspects of this Bill is the statutory effect it gives to the EC Directive 1990 on freedom of access to environmental information.  There is a growing interest, even among schoolchildren, in the importance of the environment. They have done projects in relation to how they &mdash; and indeed every citizen &mdash; are in a position and have an obligation to protect their environment. There is now greater interest and knowledge than there ever was in relation to the importance of our environment and the fact that we will have further access to information will not only improve the <Col N="2211" /> knowledge already there but will help us in our quest for a cleaner environment. In conjunction with that, obviously we want to promote and co-ordinate further research in the whole environmental area.  It is proposed to do that in the Bill and I support it.</P>
    <P>The penalties, as pointed out by a number of contributors in the debate, are pretty high.  However, I do not think that any Member should apologise for that because, very often, such proposals are the only way to deal with some of the worst offenders with regard to our environment, would-be and potential polluters. Unfortunately, this deterrent is necessary and I support it in the hope that it will bring some of the offenders to heel resulting in a better environment for all.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the Bill and I am happy to be in a position to add my words of support to the Minister and the Government.  In fairness, the Bill is supported on all sides of the House and we all know the importance of setting up the Environmental Protection Agency; it is something which we can all encourage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the Bill in general and I hope it achieves all it sets out to do.  However, like many other Bills, it can only be effective if it is funded and implemented.  One of the things I will always recall about the environment is attending a conference &mdash; I think it was in Luxembourg &mdash; in 1982 when a British delegate proudly announced that the first salmon had been caught in the River Thames in something like 20 years.  It brought home to me the serious problems facing Europe and the world in general relating to pollution as a result of a number of changes which have come about without us realising it. They have taken place gradually, over a period of time, accepted procedures in agriculture and industry changing quite dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general public &mdash; and indeed the legislators &mdash; were always advised by experts regarding the safeguards which were likely to be put in place.  I have <Col N="2212" /> often said in this House that when two groups of experts on opposing sides come together they really and truly confuse all and sundry.  They usually &mdash; and there is provision for this in the Bill &mdash; end up in court where they confuse all those who have not been confused before and, in turn, confuse themselves.  We are left with the doubtful and confused conclusions that they did not really know what they were talking about in the first place.  I say that deliberately on the basis that on issues such as pollution, the environment and toxic waste, etc., many groups of experts have over the years expressed conflicting views and held them steadfastly over a long period of time, and when ultimately some of their views and theories are proved to be unsound they then seem to withdraw gracefully from the arena and say that the information made available to them at the time they made their conclusions was perhaps unsound.  That has happened many times in the past and it will happen again in the future.  We must ensure in legislation that there is little room for manoeuvre, clearly state exactly what we have in mind and enforce the provisions.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises that there have been changes in agriculture and industry over the last number of years which have brought serious threats of pollution. Every single citizen of every country in one way or another is a potential threat to the environment and a possible source of pollution, depending on how they dispose of household waste, television sets, fridge-freezers and so on.  Anybody taking a trip in any part of the countryside, particularly &mdash; and unfortunately &mdash; close to the edges of many of our towns and cities, will find ample evidence to strongly support the theory that many of our citizens are not responsible when it comes to disposing of their household waste.  All members of local authorities will be able to cite, chapter and verse, instances where hundreds of tonnes of household waste of varying shapes and sizes have been found year after year within a half mile of many of our towns and villages.  It is a sad reflection on our <Col N="2213" /> society.  I will not name the towns although many of them are in my constituency. People will say this is because of lack of facilities for disposing of waste but I do not think that is an excuse.  It is a disgraceful disregard for the environment, other people's rights and a total lack of civic spirit that that kind of outlandish behaviour should still continue at the end of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>The changing methods of production and in general administration in agriculture and industry have undoubtedly increased the threat to pollution.  Dealing with the agricultural side, I should like to see balance and indeed there is provision for this in the Bill.  It is not impossible to virtually eliminate all threats of pollution from the agricultural sector.  The facilities are there for people to avail of.  Many people follow the guidelines and take great care to ensure that there is no pollution. Most of the farming community also take great care to ensure that there is no pollution although a minority as in every other sector, have a somewhat laid-back and cavalier attitude to the regulations. They hope they will not be caught, that it is a once-off offence and that nothing will happen.  However, those things will happen and when they do can have very serious consequences, not only for the people in the immediate locality but for those many miles away.  This is particularly important in relation to the pollution of watercourses, where at a distance of perhaps ten miles from the point at which the pollution occurs a serious incident could arise resulting in loss of life.</P>
    <P>Almost 20 years ago many of us held the view that there was a threat of pollution from the extensive use of nitrogenous fertilisers. When nitrogenous fertilisers were first introduced in this country experts proved beyond a shadow of doubt that they were harmless, that nothing could go wrong.  However, those of us without expert advice who held the view that it was a threat to pollution were right.  The people who had been involved in the industry for years knew what they were doing and had a healthy respect for <Col N="2214" /> the environment, but unfortunately the attitude seemed to change around the early seventies with the intensive production of these fertilisers in tandem with European assistance and advice.  I will refer to that matter in greater detail at a later stage.  At that time everybody who was called upon to advise the farming community had the same advice to give, but unfortunately it has now been proven that they scarcely had the correct information at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The possibility of pollution from modern intensive industry is much greater than was the case years ago.  The concentration of pollutants is now so great that even a small quantity can have catastrophic effects throughout a whole community.  Many of the sewage treatment plants are completely incapable of dealing with the concentrated pollutants that may get into the system.  Even the most modern plants are not capable of controlling the kind of pollutants that emanate from some industries, particularly the chemical industry.  I say that in the knowledge that we need to create jobs, but again there must be balance. There must be a healthy regard for the protection of our environment and our heritage for future generations.  We should take into account all the knowledge of the particular firm involved. A firm must have technical information available to them as to the likely effects of discharges into the sewerage system, their chemists will tell them what the likely effects are.  It is necessary that they have a healthy respect for the possible side effects and the damage that might be done.  They should ensure that nothing happens that would have a detrimental effect on the environment.</P>
    <P>I refer to these matters on the basis of perhaps the once-off pollutant that may get into the system.  Accidents will always happen and we must provide for those. If an accident takes place we should not immediately close down half a dozen industries around the country.  We have to maintain a balance.  Neither should we close down half the farms as a result of a particular incident.  We must try to eliminate the cause of the accident, make sure <Col N="2215" /> it does not recur and try to ensure that the people involved are fully conversant with the regulations and are fully aware of their responsibilities to the community, the environment and the country at large.</P>
    <P>Occasionally an incident may occur which is not accidental.  Let us take the case that arose a few years ago when an oil tanker deposited a load into a ditch on a national primary route.  The oil flowed into the water course, into a tributary and eventually found its way into a reservoir, severely polluting the water. That offence was not accidental.  It was caused deliberately by an individual who was not very concerned about the environment or about people's lives or health but was only concerned about getting from A to B in a given time with a given load.  Whether such an incident occurs in the agricultural or the industrial sector, it is unpardonable.  The provisions in the Bill &mdash; I have studied them in the same way as everybody else and I will not go through them in detail today &mdash; by way of penalties are necessary and I hope they will be effective.  It is essential to differentiate between the accidental polluter and the deliberate polluter, and where the incident is deliberate there should be no doubt about the action taken.</P>
    <P>The pollutants that are prevalent today are many and varied.  There is air pollution, which has been referred to by many speakers, water pollution, noise pollution and odour pollution.  There is pollution of visual amenities and pollution, if it can be called that, of irradiation.  Much of the food we eat is subject to irradiation.  There are those who say that irradiation causes pollution and those who say it does not.  It extends the shelf life of a whole range of products, seriously interrupting the ecology of the whole system in an artificial way.  This poses the question as to whether or not the process has been proven to be safe. Experts say it is quite safe, that there is nothing to worry about; but experts have given similar information in relation to other matters in the past and I have no <Col N="2216" /> doubt that at some stage in the future they will have second thoughts.</P>
    <P>Let us now consider water pollution and how simple it is to upset the whole water supply system.  In my constituency in the past few weeks an accident occurred &mdash; we hope it was an accident &mdash; whereby the water supply was polluted in almost half the town of Naas.  First, it took virtually 24 hours of investigation to determine that a serious pollutant existed.  In that period, a vital period in which to react to the problem, further damage was caused because it was not possible to indicate clearly to the public that the water supply was polluted to such an extent.  Second, we should have been able to say quite clearly that the nature of the pollutant was such as to ensure that an order be given that the supply should not be used for several days.  We were not in a position to give that order for the simple reason that we did not have the technical knowledge available to us which would clearly indicate that the system was polluted.  The result was a very serious pollution of the water supply.</P>
    <P>In that incident the possibility of serious damage to health arose as a result of pollution of the public water supply.  In that case it was a well, ground water, that was polluted.  This should bring to mind the vulnerability of the public water supply throughout the country in the reservoirs that supply this city and every city and town in the country.  We should seriously consider the possible sources of pollution to those water supplies and recognise how vulnerable they are to pollution, either deliberate or accidental. We should try to eliminate in so far as we can those possibilities because public health is at stake, as can be seen from the case to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>Air pollution has been mentioned by a number of speakers and I will not deal with the matter in any detail except to say that the sources of air pollution are increasing.  The information available to us, even in recent years, is not reassuring. When talking about the emissions from motor vehicles I must refer to Deputy Ryan's suggestion of the advisability of <Col N="2217" /> using public transport more often.  I agree that those of us who can use public transport in their daily work should do so, but unfortunately some people cannot.  He suggested that a bus could carry as many people as would travel in 30 cars. However, some of the buses I have seen would pollute the atmosphere to the same extent as 40 or 50 cars.  This is a serious problem.  While I accept and understand the point the Deputy was making in relation to public transport, we would need to upgrade the standard of many of these vehicles, particularly in built-up areas.  If one drives along the quays on a wet morning one sees a blue haze rising from the exhausts and one would have to ask about the effects of inhaling these fumes.  It is obviously not good for us.  It is said that smoking is not good for us &mdash; even though I smoke &mdash; but I wonder how bad inhaling those fumes is for our health?</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to noise pollution. This comes up again and again, particularly in relation to the operation of factory premises close to residential areas. Granting planning permission is a matter for the local authorities, but when granting planning permission for a particular industry regard should be had to the level of noise that will be generated and which will affect the people who live in the area. They should find another location for noisy industry as people have a right to a reasonable quality of life and should not have to live within hearing distance of penetrating noises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That noise can also be penetrating from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now refer to offensive odours. We have the best of intentions when we introduce a Bill.  The setting up of an independent agency has merits and demerits.  Odours emanating from agriculture processes affects rural areas. Some agricultural processes have been in operation for thousands of years. However, the odours from organic farming and other long standing processes <Col N="2218" /> may be offensive for a short time, but more intensive farming methods, such as slurry distribution, have caused more serious problems over the past number of years which will have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>A number of sewage treatment plants built over the past ten years are recognised as the most modern in Europe &mdash; indeed, technical experts were able to tell us that these were the most modern plants in Europe &mdash; yet two years later one could not pass within five miles of the plant without being overcome by an offensive odour.  One such plant is situated in Osberstown in Naas, which the Minister will know quite well.  In fact, if the prevailing wind is right the Minister should be able to detect this odour when he comes out of Rathangan.</P>
    <P>Indeed, a similar problem exists in Leixlip.  Although the plant has been upgraded at enormous expense three times in the past ten years &mdash; following the advice of technical experts, who were better paid than we are &mdash; and on every occasion the experts said the plant would cater for the larger population and would be absolutely trouble free, three weeks after they had finished the upgrading and had gone away, we had the same problem again.  Hundreds of people protest about the offensive odour.  When we ring up the experts they tell us that this odour should be eliminated now as extensive renovation works have been carried out and the problem should not occur again. Like me, I am sure the Minister, who must have dealt with this on countless occasions, is a little bit sceptical about these claims because I believe that many of these experts do not know what they are talking about, or the plants are not being operated in accordance with the conditions in the sales catalogue.  Perhaps we are being conned; we are spending taxpayers' hard earned money upgrading the plants which at the end of the day, do not function as they are supposed to.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will also be aware that we have a grossly overloaded sewage treatment plant in Kilcullen.  We have had numerous promises over the years that it would be upgraded and that it would link into the Osberstown plant <Col N="2219" />&mdash; which is giving off the offensive odour. During the local elections a representative of the Progressive Democrats, who usually take the high moral ground, told the unfortunate people that a decision to provide the necessary funds to upgrade the plant at Kilcullen was imminent.  A week later somebody else &mdash; very much in the tradition of Fianna Fáil &mdash; intimated to the local community once more that a firm commitment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 59 empowers the Minister, after having regard to any criteria drawn up by the agency under subsection (4), to set mandatory standards for effluent discharges from sanitary authority plants, sewers and pipes.  I want to say that that pollution is taking place now.  It has taken place repeatedly and it is within the ambit of the Minister and the Minister of State and their Department to provide the necessary funds to eliminate the source of pollution to the public water supply, that is, the water we drink.  Something needs to be done about that now; it is quite simple.</P>
      <P>Another point I want to make is that when the agency are set up provision will be made that a local authority may be prosecuted in the event of failure to eliminate such pollutants.  But will any provision be made to prosecute the Minister &mdash; whoever that Minister might be &mdash; who is in fact the person ultimately responsible for the provision of the necessary capital allocation to ensure that local authorities do not pollute public water supplies in that fashion?  The Bill makes no provision, nor is any provision likely to be made, that will in any way assist to eliminate that very serious threat to public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other area in the category of possible pollutants that I want to mention comes within the ambit of local authorities and comes ultimately within the ambit of the Minister, whether it be the Minister sitting opposite or his colleague <Col N="2221" /> from the Progressive Democrats who had just left the House.  The matter to which I refer is the package treatment plants provided by local authorities to serve various housing schemes throughout the country.  Just as I mentioned in relation to the major sewage treatment plants, for some unknown reason there seems to be a terrible tendency for those treatment plants to overload into streams and to cause an offensive odour and to cause pollution which can ultimately end up in the public water supply.  The heavy rain of last night provides a classic example of what can happen when the watertable rises very sharply as the result of a sudden downpower.  The threat of pollution to the water supply is magnified 100 times after a heavy downpour: there is a large amount of water in flood, the watertable rises and the possibility of overflowing sewers is created.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, there is one other point that is rather peculiar.  It has been a practice by builders and by local authorities throughout the years &mdash; and this is authorised &mdash; to flush out public sewers.  To flush out a public sewer if an occasional stormwater shore should go into it is an accepted practice supported by local authorities and the Department of the Environment.  The theory was that when the stormwater went into the public sewer there was no danger of pollution, that it would be treated at a sewage treatment plant further down the road; but nobody ever seemed to ask what would happen if it backed up through the stormwater shores and got into the public water supply by another route, which in fact has happened.  Despite all the expertise, despite all the clever people and despite all of the technical evidence showing that if a certain amount of stormwater were put into a sewer it would have the effect of scouring out the sewer and ensuring that it worked efficiently, one simple thing was forgotten: that these pipes block up; and when they blocked up they were blocked also by sewage, which in turn went into the stormwater system and could then be discharged through another route into a stream or a lake, and the consequences of that are known. <Col N="2222" /> I shall not go into any more detail in that regard.  I think I have made my point.</P>
    <P>As bluntly as possible, I want to say that the guidelines and the provisions of the Bill are excellent.  It is an excellent idea to prosecute local authorities for actions such as failing to provide a necessary treatment plant to ensure that pollution does not occur; but it is equally incumbent on the Minister of any Government at any time to ensure that the necessary funds are made available by his or her Department so that that work can be carried out.  Those funds are not provided by the local authorities themselves; they are provided by the Department.  I am a little worried that perhaps that may be a weakness in the Bill.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Bernard Allen, referred to the proposed independence of the agency.  That is a good idea.  But there is one flaw in that regard, Deputy Allen pointed it out and I support him in his argument.  The point raised by the Deputy and supported by me is that if a question were asked in the House in a couple of years' time about the Environmental Protection Agency would Members be likely to be told that the Minister had no official responsibility to the House?  I get that answer all of the time.  I am sure everybody else in the House gets that answer from time to time when asking parliamentary questions.  I am quite sure that when the Minister was sitting on this side of the House he would have got that answer from time to time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That answer is heard every day of every week.  I have noticed a growing tendency for responsibility to be hived off to an outside agency thereby ensuring that a Minister &mdash; any Minister of any Government &mdash; is not dragged into the House daily to answer questions or to speak on questions asked during an Adjournment debate and so on unless an emergency arises.  There is a danger in that tendency.  All agencies should be <Col N="2223" /> responsible to the Minister and the Minister should be responsible to the House so that Members who are elected by the public have the right at any time to put down a parliamentary question or to raise a matter on the Adjournment and to have an issue discussed in the House.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day &mdash; and recent events should serve to illustrate my point &mdash; it is the people in this House who will be held responsible by the public outside. At the end of the day it is the Minister, whoever that Minister may be, who will be held responsible by the public.  So, it is not such a good idea to get away from the responsibility of answering parliamentary questions and it is not such a good idea for a Minister to be able to tell the House that he or she has no official responsibility in the House and then to have Opposition Members spending tedious hours trying to find out ways and means of tricking a Minister into answering a question under those circumstances. I make no apology for repeating my statement that in future legislation the more a Minister can accept responsibility to the House for any agency, State body or semi-State body the better for himself or herself.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned the limitations of local authorities, their responsibility and the superseding responsibility of the Minister, so I do not intend to pursue that line any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some speakers have referred to sea pollution and in that regard we all think immediately of Sellafield.  I agree that some of the proposals heard recently in relation to underground storage of nuclear waste are completely unacceptable and that the dumping of nuclear waste at sea in cannisters is also completely unacceptable.  Somebody sometime somewhere will have to accept responsibility.  Some future generations may well look back with anger and ask why the legislators and the people of our time allowed it to happen.  By the same token, I have to say that virtually every modern State now generates a certain amount of nuclear waste of one kind or another, and that includes this modern <Col N="2224" /> State.  In fact, there are those who would say that a certain amount of nuclear activity is generated in this House from time to time.  Certainly Ireland does generate nuclear waste, which does have to be dealt with.  The odd thing is that nobody is prepared to accept that it will ever be dealt with, nobody wants to accept responsibility.  It is a position similar to that pertaining to the responsibilty for the dumping of toxic waste on land: nobody wants to deal with it, nobody wants to accept it and certainly nobody wants to live near it &mdash; and I can well understand that attitude.  At the same time, those wastes exist and some means have to be found to ensure that they do not build up <i>ad infinitum</i> in the system to arrive in a few years' time at a position of being incapable of dealing with the problem.  That generation may well ask: why was this allowed to happen?  I sincerely hope it does not happen.  We must be honest with ourselves &mdash; and the public must address this &mdash; in that, if we generate toxic waste of any kind, nuclear or other, we should devise ways and means to deal with it.  Otherwise, we should cease to generate it.  We cannot have one without the other.  Hospitals, photographic laboratories and so on generate even minor nuclear waste which must be dealt with.  Pretending that it does not exist is no justifiable excuse to advance.</P>
    <P>I reject the proposals for the processing of nuclear waste at Sellafield in undersea storage caverns and so on.  Equally I reject the dumping at sea of cannisters of nuclear waste.  That is not now as prevalent as heretofore.  All of this presents a threat to the fishing industry and needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the matter of illegal dumping.  The danger with illegal, uncontrolled dumping is that the people who engage in it have little regard for the visual amenities of the relevant areas or its impact on the environment.  They have no knowledge of the dangers it is likely to pose to other members of the community and, worst of all, generally do not care.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the lack of progress made in regard to recycling of waste.  I <Col N="2225" /> often wonder how much example we set even in this House.  We recycle much rhetoric from time to time; indeed, I engage in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are serious about recycling of paper and so on why do we not set an example in this Legislature? For example, we use quite an amount of paper in this building and to recycle it would be an excellent way to set a headline for everybody else, thereby further eliminating the pollution threat.  We are all conscious of the need to protect trees. I do not want to go into detail on that but it is relevant.  We should encourage the recycling of paper and set an example here in the usage of such recycled paper. We appear to use a little but not very much.</P>
      <P>In recent years local authorities have endeavoured to recycle a certain amount of domestic waste, such as bottles, tin cans and so on.  But for the existence of REHAB we would not have been successful in the disposal of such material. Even with the assistance of local authorities it is almost impossible to devise a waste disposal system.  We must remember that virtually every hotelier and publican is anxious that a system be devised whereby they could categorise their waste and have it recycled.  Sufficient is not being done in that area.  The Minister of State who is present takes a special interest in the environment and I suggest that she examine how hoteliers and publicans could be facilitated and not have to wait six months, or six years, to have their bottles, tin cans and so on disposed of sometimes causing injury at dumps.</P>
      <P>In the Minister of State's absence I referred to the Kilcullen sewage plant.</P>

      <P>I was surprised at the way the Progressive Democrats behaved in the course of the recent happening because I expected more of them.  Before the next election I hope that scheme will <Col N="2226" /> be operational.  It would be a great boost to the Kilcullen area.  Indeed, while they are at that, they should also implement the Robertstown scheme &mdash; in a tourist high amenity area &mdash; which has been on the rounds, in the Minister's office, out of the Minister's office and been the subject of reports, amended specifications an so on in recent years.  We would be delighted if the Minister's imprimatur could be applied there also.</P>
      <P>The ability of the proposed agency through the availabilty of funds is the most important point to be stressed.  If the agency are to be effective they will have to have funds, not necessarily to establish a huge bureacucracy spreading their wings in all directions, creating a pyramid system or the like, but rather funded in such a way as to enable them fulfil their functions.  Virtually every Bill passed by this House carries an obligation on local authorities.  They do not have sufficient money to fulfil their functions. If this agency are to be hamstrung in the same manner a serious problem will obtain.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the necessary funds are made available to the agency to enable them fulfil their functions and responsibilities.  If such funds are not made available the provisions of the Bill cannot be enforced in that there will be no staff to carry out the necessary inspections and there will not be a willingness on the part of those who are placed in that position to carry that burden on their shoulders.  This has occurred many times.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned section 59 which places responsibility on local authorities to comply with the regulations, thereby ensuring the elimination of pollution and so on.  Once again I might underpin the point that, from the point of view of the Minister, it is vital that he or she ensure that local authorities are not placed in the invidious position that they cannot comply with the appropriate regulations through lack of adequate funding.  That is the direct responsibility of the Minister and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have mentioned the sewage treatment plant at Derrinturn, Carbury, County Kildare, which has been a source <Col N="2227" /> of pollution also and in relation to which we are hoping something will be done. The two treatment plants dealing with local authority houses, one in Ardclough, the other in Derrinturn, are malfunctioning.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the environment affects so many facets of life.  It affects every person living on the globe in one way or another so that the need for its protection must be greater now than ever.  We must do more than merely pay lip service to the environment.  We must ensure there is put in place a mechanism that will work and, at the same time, place responsibility on those who should be responsible for its protection, whether they be farmers, industrialists, Government Ministers, local authority managers, public representatives or others.  We all have an involvement, a duty and a responsibility for its protection. It is my hope that we will live up to that responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is one responsibility to which the general public have never lived up to, with one or two exceptions, one exception are the organisers of the tidy towns competition who have focused such attention on the issue that it has become socially undesirable to be seen throwing litter on the streets.  If one travels through any village, town or city on, say, a Friday evening, Saturday or Sunday morning one can see the disgracful state of footpaths on main streets as a result of people having discarded paper bags which contained chips, cardboard boxes, bottles, cidar flagons, plastic, paper and so on.  It has often been said that sufficient litter bins are not available.  The litter bins can be placed within three of four feet and can be surrounded by a tide of litter thrown indiscriminately by people who should have greater regard and respect for themselves and for the rest of society. It should be possible to generate civic spirit so that people will recognise that they are messing up their own back yard by littering the streets of our towns, villages and cities.</P>

      <P>I assure Deputy Durkan <Col N="2228" /> that in view of certain changes in constituency boundaries I will be endeavouring to complement his efforts regarding improvements in the Kilcullen area.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which comes before the House following extensive and constructive debate in the Seanad.  I have in the past spoken in this House on environmental matters and indicated my strong support for measures which aid in the regulations of the environment, which promote environmentally friendly industrial and tourism development and greater awareness among all sections of the community of the importance of safeguarding our environmental heritage.</P>
      <P>We are very fortunate that the ravages of industrial development throughout Europe and elsewhere have not impacted on us.  At the same time we have the benefit of learning from others of the impact of unregulated or insufficiently regulated developments on the environment, urban and rural.  We have put that knowledge to good use.  This Bill is yet another example of the intelligent assimilation of that experience into our legislative framework.</P>
      <P>We have many times in different contexts considered ourselves unfortunate due to our relative isolation from other parts of Europe and the cost in economic terms.  Equally we have benefited from that very isolation in many ways, avoiding to a large extent the destructive influence of major industrial developments and not least the terrible destruction of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pace of change worldwide is, however, catching up with us and relative distances are perceptibly much less.  This was brought home to us in no uncertain manner by the Chernobyl disaster which was a salutary lesson when considered in the context of Sellafield and our proximity to the west coast of England.  We must ensure that our physical isolation does not deter or delay the implementation of safeguards for the well being of our society.  We must keep our eyes focused on the rest of the world to ensure that we have the most up-to-date knowledge and expertise to maintain those <Col N="2229" /> safeguards at the highest level.  This Bill and the establishment of an Environmental Protection Agency will provide a framework for us to do just that.</P>
    <P>I have the good fortune to represent in this House the people of Wicklow who are justifiably proud of their country and its beauty.  The well deserved title &ldquo;The Garden of Ireland&rdquo; serves to highlight not the perception of the Wicklow people but rather the perception of those outside the county, particularly in Dublin, who avail of its beauty, tranquility and splendid environment.  It also serves to highlight the importance of balancing industrial development by the dedication of certain areas as environmental oases, unspoilt and pure.  There is an important analogy between the magnificent facilities offered by Wicklow to the industrialised areas of the east coast and the facilities offered by our entire country to the industrialised nations of Europe.  The relative beauty and environmental purity offer enormous potential particularly for the development of tourism, which in turn will offer many thousands of jobs, in addition to a healthy society.  Recognising these strategic advantages and utilising our resources to exploit them must be a priority for all, particularly for those of us elected to represent the people and to provide leadership.</P>
    <P>For these and for many other related reasons I welcome this Bill.  It is a clear signal to all concerned within and without our country that we take environmental matters seriously and intend not only to maintain the balance of advantage relative to the rest of Europe but to improve upon it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not a statement of our intent with regard to the environment.  We have made that clear in other legislation and on other occasions.  The protection of the natural environment has long been a priority of Government, making environmental issues central to national policy, giving Ireland a strong international voice on these matters.  We can proudly demonstrate a progressive and pro-active approach to enhancing environmental consciousness and in taking measures to safeguard the environment.  In relatively <Col N="2230" /> recent times the Air Pollution Act became law.  We have signed the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on long range transboundary air pollution.  We have made special orders to control smoke pollution and ratified the Montreal Protocol on CFCs and their effect on the ozone layer.  These measures are in addition to a range of pro-active policies in regard to water pollution, cleaner beaches, unleaded petrol, environmental awareness and so on.  We should not be so foolish as to say we have all matters under control but we can say that we have done a lot and are striving to do much more.</P>
    <P>The importance of this Bill is that it helps to cement the good works undertaken so far and to put in place licensing, monitoring and advisory services to ensure that there is no slippage and that we maintain the rate of progress achieved so far.  The agency will provide leadership and expertise in this area and will supplement and complement existing bodies.  This is an extremely important point.  I would be very concerned if this Bill were proposing to take primary responsibility away from local authorities for maintaining high standards in environmental and planning matters.  It is critical that those accountable to local communities should take the responsibility very seriously and should not be given any opportunity to pass the buck elsewhere.  In the nature of things, however, there is not always complete awareness or knowledge of the most up-to-date information on environmental matters or complete appreciation of sensitivities in this area.  In that the agency will fulfil this role and give active support to local authorities, it will provide a tremendous new facility.  I would encourage all local authorities to take full advantage of this facility as I would expect the agency to provide a thoroughly professional service to the local authorities. The net result can only be an improvement both in the standards employed and in the general public awareness of the importance and significance of environmental matters, not only in relation to <Col N="2231" /> health but also in relation to industrial and tourism developments.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessarily lengthy.  The first 18 of the 110 sections are essentially concerned with housekeeping.  Part II provides for the establishment and incorporation of the agency and includes provision for the appointment of the director general and other staff.  There will be debate about the procedures for appointing the director general and the constitution of the committee to aid in that process.  I am satisfied that there exists a balance of expertise and interests to ensure that high quality candidates are nominated.  While the advisory committee will naturally be comprised of people with an expertise in environmental protection and related environmental areas, I would urge the Minister to ensure that there is balanced representation of industrial, tourism and other economic interests on the board. Such representation is provided for in the Bill and I strongly support it as it will give the advisory committee greater breadth and influence and avoid the perception that they might be overly biased in any one direction and not considerate of industrial, tourism or other economic factors which are relevant to environmental policy.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 and 34 are the main sections dealing with staff matters.  This is a matter which I am particularly anxious to address.  Over the past eight years or so this House has considered a number of Bills dealing with the establishment of new bodies or the creation of private companies from sections of Government Departments.  I am referring to such companies as Telecom Éireann, An Post, Coillte Teoranta, FÁS and the Health and Safety Authority.  In dealing with those Bills, we discussed proposals in regard to the transfer of staff, their conditions of employment, etc.  It would appear &mdash; the Minister may correct me on this &mdash; that aspects of these sections are significantly different from similar sections of the Acts setting up the companies to which I have just referred. The essential difference is that while <Col N="2232" /> other Bills provided for the transfer of staff from a discreet block or area of a Government Department or body this Bill provides for a catch-all situation in which staff may be transferred from many different bodies both now and in the future.  Equally it appears to provide for the compulsory transfer of staff at any time.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, sections 29 and 34 provide for powers which may be more extensive than similar powers in other Acts.  I raise this point because the involvement and commitment of staff to the goals of the proposed agency will be absolutely critical to their success.  I believe all the bodies to which I referred earlier have thrived because of the support given by the staff who undertook their new tasks wholeheartedly.  It is not that there were never any difficulties or disputes in these bodies but given the fundamental change in circumstances these have been minimal.  As a generality, the success of these organisations has been due in no small way to the full commitment of the staff involved.</P>
    <P>Essentially what I am saying is that very careful consideration must be given to the sections of the Bill dealing with staff, their transfer and conditions of employment.  The co-operation of unions, staff associations and the like at this stage will be repaid a hundredfold in the future.  I am certain the Minister and the Department will be anxious to follow that route.  As one who spent many years in industrial management, I am very well aware of the benefits of a good industrial relations environment and the development of sound collective agreements. Therefore, I ask the Minister to ensure that in all matters relating to the establishment of the new agency, such as staff transfers, tenure of office and consultation procedures, the best possible environment is created from the outset.</P>
    <P>I know that a Second Stage debate is not the time to deal with specifics but I want to ask the Minister to consider whether future designations of staff should be made compulsory or whether it would be in the best interests of the agency to advertise openly for the staff <Col N="2233" /> and expertise they need so as not to give rise to hostility among staff because of an unwillingness to transfer.  In that regard I would also ask the Minister to consider the situation whereby the staff of local authorities and State bodies are free to engage in political activity and become elected members of local authorities without the need to give up their jobs for the duration of their appointment.  Under section 36 (2) they cease to have the right on designation to the agency.  Is this consistent with section 31 (3) which provides that the staff will be transferred with the same conditions of employment which they had previously?  I believe such a provision is also enshrined in EC and domestic law.  I may not be correct and I ask the Minister to advise me on this matter.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the functions of the agency.  I have already indicated my full support for the establishment of the agency and for the assistance they will give to local authorities.  The agency will also have the power to issue licences in a number of areas.  I have one concern in regard to the issue of licences, that is the parallel procedures proposed in relation to an application for planning permission to a local authority and an application to the agency for a licence under Part IV which deals with integrated pollution control.  If the local authority carry out the environment impact assessment independent of the agency's consideration of the licence application, are matters such as environmental quality standards and emission standards not appropriate to both applications?  I ask the Minister to clarify how this procedure will work effectively in practice so as to avoid a chicken and egg situation later on.</P>
    <P>It is very important to establish clearly the respective responsibilities of the agency and the local authority so that their joint efforts in the handling of such applications will be effective and efficient and there will be no undue delay in processing applications.  The same situation may arise in regard to conditions imposed by the agency in relation to, for example, physical features which may impact on <Col N="2234" /> the planning competence and responsibility of the local authority.  If there are any concerns in this area I would ask the Minister to set out clear guidelines on the operations of these bodies.</P>
    <P>In the past the farming community have been much maligned and exageratedly accused by many people of causing pollution, particularly of our waters. A major contributor to water pollution is the local authorities.  At present in my home town of Rathdrum in County Wicklow, raw sewage is pouring into the beautiful Avonmore River.  This is to the detriment of public health and is ruining a wonderful amenity which is used for swimming, angling, etc.  This amenity which is used by both local people and tourists is being rendered unusable.  In fairness to the local authority, they have addressed this problem as effectively as they can.  They have submitted plans to the Department of the Environment seeking approval and necessary funding for the provision of proper and adequate treatment facilities.  I would urge the Minister and the Department to respond expeditiously and positively to this submission so that this totally unacceptable problem can be corrected.</P>
    <P>I quote the Rathdrum situation merely as an example &mdash; it is far from being an isolated case.  People in other areas of County Wicklow are also screaming out for similar attention.  I want to thank the Minister and the Department for allocating funding in the recent past to Wicklow County Council which has enabled them to provide improved facilities in Wicklow town, Baltinglass, Kilpedder, Ashford and Hollywood.  I would exhort the Minister to provide the necessary funding for the carrying out of similar works in the other needy areas of County Wicklow.  Indeed, my comments in this regard apply to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>While there have been a few offenders in the farming community, as in all walks of life, they have shown great responsibility as a general body of people.  The farmers of Wicklow and of the entire country have responded magnificently to the call to install anti-pollution measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2235" /> As indicated earlier by my colleague, Deputy Síle de Valera, the farming community have been assisted greatly and encouraged by the substantial grant aid for this purpose which was made available through the good offices of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy.  I offer my sincere thanks and compliments to the Minister for this forward thinking approach which is helping to keep our environment in good shape.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on the positive and constructive approach taken by the vast majority of farmers.  I have some positive statistics from my own county which will endorse that statement. Following the evidence of widespread fish kills during the summer of 1987 a programme of measures to combat water pollution was introduced by the Minister for the Environment for implementation by the local authorities, the fishery boards, the farm advisory bodies and, most important, the farmers themselves. As a result of these measures there was a dramatic downturn in the number of reported pollution incidents during 1988. Specifically, in County Wicklow the number of new cases investigated reduced from 91 in 1987 to 35 in 1988; furthermore, cases of agricultural origin accounted for only 18 of the 35, which represents a sharp drop from 73 per cent to 51 per cent in the occurrence of agricultural pollution as a percentage of the total number of cases investigated.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the number of fish kills in County Wicklow fell from six in 1987 to two in 1988.  Of these one was very minor and very little supporting evidence was found, the second resulted from a diesel spillage on a farmyard rather than agricultural pollution <i>per se.</i>  Overall, between late 1984 and the end of March 1989, Wicklow County Council personnel visited a total of 385 farms in the county.  Of these, 123 visits were in response to complaints under the provisions of the Water Pollution Act, 116 resulted from recent changes in planning legislation, with the balance of 146 being due to the farm survey.  Categorising <Col N="2236" /> these in terms of pollution risk, 32 per cent were assessed as low risk, 37 per cent as medium risk and 31 per cent as high risk.  The same council followed up initial visits either by issuing advisory letters or by section 12 notices.  Recent inspections show that farmers, by and large, are taking their responsibilities very seriously.  Remedial works have been carried out and are still being carried out.  These responsible land owners and land workers are taking advantage of the grant aid provided by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in this area in the interests of the environment and in the interest not only of themselves and their families but of their neighbours both rural and urban.</P>
    <P>There are a number of functions attaching to this agency which I welcome, particularly those contained in section 72, which deals with the carrying out of environment audits; section 74, which deals with codes of practice and section 76, which deals with labelling of products and services.  In the past I have proposed a quality standard approach in regard to the environment.  This is an excellent and worthwhile step in that direction.  The carrying out of audits and formulating codes of practice will provide a very valuable service to the community and lead towards a gradual assimilation of higher standards into everyday life.  I welcome also the policy of transparency which the Minister has imposed on the agency.  I am a great believer in informing and educating the public and the open availability of information is an absolutely correct policy.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome and support this Bill and I look forward to its progress through the House.  I mentioned earlier the beauty of County Wicklow, which provides inspiration to many environmentalists. I noted also in some reports the prospect of locating this agency outside of Dublin; if so, I can think of no more apt or beautiful location than County Wicklow.  I am sure the Minister is already aware of that.  When the location of the headquarters is being dealt with I exhort all concerned to give <Col N="2237" /> consideration to the merits of County Wicklow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990.  At the outset I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State during practically all of this debate, which shows her keen interest in the Bill.  The number of Deputies queuing up to make a contribution is an indication that people are aware of the importance of this Bill.  In fact, I place it among the most important Bills which have come into the House since I became a Deputy.  Without a properly protected environment there would be very little future for any of us.  We are all concerned but we take very little care. The with-it conversation &mdash; or, to use a modern phrase, the yuppie conversation &mdash; if one is around any of the houses where such talks take place is the ozone layer and the damage being caused to it. That is thousands of miles away in the outer atmosphere and we should come down to more basic things and take a look at the damage we are causing to the earth, the land we trod on, the planet on which we live and leave the problems of the ozone layer to the scientists who are well trained and well advised on such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, I should say that difficulties in that field have been rectified and manufacturers of the various gases which were affecting and causing damage to the ozone layer have been brought into line. Those same people who would take part in and spend numerous hours in that type of discussion would themselves litter the countryside, causing untold damage.  Yet they are blind to the fact that the modern housewife is now cleaner than clean, beaming in on every advertisment for modern chemicals for getting everything brighter than bright and a shinier than shiny kitchen.  These chemicals are bought by the ounce and are poured by the tonne down drains and into sewers. Once they pass out to the end of the garden, which it is nicely landscaped, the husband, wife and family do not understand, do not know and do not care what <Col N="2238" /> happens.  That is a tragedy because those chemicals are doing untold damage.</P>
    <P>Speaker after speaker has come in here and said that local authorities are polluting. Why are local authorities polluting? They are polluting because they cannot deal with the chemicals which are destroying the very agents they set up to break down the bacteria to render harmless the waste from a modern household. If people are aiming for a shinier than shiny kitchen, the whiter than white bleach, it is at a cost to our environment on this planet.  These substances are going into our streams and our rivers and causing fish kills that are being attributed to other factors.  I will come to that later.</P>
    <P>Often at the weekend a husband and wife will get together and tidy up, putting the rubbish into plastic bags.  They will put it in the boot of the car and will go for a drive in the country and when no one is looking they will get out and dump the rubbish across the nearest hedge. They could not care less as long as it is gone from their house.  That is not good enough.  There will always be someone living a short distance of the hedge.  There is no such thing nowadays as being remote, as any county council will confirm from expriences they have in trying to establish a tip head.  We are all guilty and the message has to be spelt out. Young people, the very people who will talk about protecting the ozone layer, discard litter throughout towns and villages when they go to fleadhs, discos or concerts.  What about the layer of rubbish they leave after them?  It is a disgrace to the nation.  We are a dirty nation.  Our homes and our gardens are beautiful, but the countryside is not.  When the county council send out workers in the springtime to cut the grass verges one should see all the litter that they turn up.  Where did that come from?  It did not fall from the upper atmosphere.  It came from the windows of cars, discarded by people having drank their coke, orange or eaten bars of chocolate.  The car was clean and the countryside was littered.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Many of the containers discarded in this way could be recycled.  We have in <Col N="2239" /> Cavan a tin bank for collecting drink tins. This was put there by a local environment committee, whose excellent work I acknowledge.  We had an interesting lecture one evening from the lady in charge of the environmental committee and she imparted a lot of information to us.  The tin bank paid all the costs of running the environmental campaign in County Cavan last year and it paid for prizes to schools and individuals for coming up with ideas to keep the countryside clean. The tins, as far as I know, are brought to Hammond Lane in Dublin and they are recycled.  Why is there not such a bank in every town, village and parish?  Why can people not be trained to segregate their rubbish and put their tins into these banks?  It would generate an income for a charity or an environmental committee and it would keep the countryside clean.</P>
    <P>On the evening of the environment lecture the lady on the committee told us that plastics such as coke bottles, orange bottles and the large 7-UP bottles can be recycled, that in fact there is a factory in my own county, Wellman International in Mullagh, County Cavan, which recycles such products.  I was amazed to hear that material for recycling is being imported by the boat load from Europe. People all over Europe who are conscious of litter collect these bottles of all descriptions. They are put into large containers and are shipped here for recycling in Mullagh, County Cavan.  It is a marvellous industry employing over 300 people. Never has the word &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; been mentioned with regard to this industry. It is a clean industry recycling plastic materials and the fibre from old mattreses which are being imported from the poorer Eastern bloc countries.  Yet here we seem to be that rich that we could not care less and it is not worth our while to collect these bottles and we just throw them out.  It would not be impossible to organise a collection point in every town and village.  I imagine it would pay private companies to become involved in this, as surely there is a cost in importing them from abroad.  Surely these bottles can be collected throughout the country by the <Col N="2240" /> private companies who have gone into refuse collection and who are giving an excellent service.  These banks could be serviced weekly, the load collected and brought to the recycling point in Mullagh. We should look at that possibility.</P>
    <P>Plastic refuse is the curse of the nation because it lasts for so long.  It takes years to break down.  Plastic bags are lying around everywhere, especially the plastic bags we get in the supermarkets which are lightweight and which are to be seen blowing all around the country.  We have forests coming into production.  Most of our timbers are soft timbers fit for little more than wood pulp.  There is a major industry in the wood pulp industry &mdash; for instance, the manufacturing of paper, cardboard and so on.  Why can we not go back to the strong paper bags like the ones we had long ago when I went shopping with my mother and father?  Everything was wrapped in brown paper and brought home on the carrier of the bicycle and it did not spill all over the road.  The paper was substantial.  Surely it is not beyond the realms of possibility that paper bags could be used.  The reason I suggest paper is because it is clean.  If it gets damp it will melt away. It can be burned without causing toxic fumes and it can be recycled.  If people are too lazy to gather it up it can be discarded much easier than plastic.  Some of the supermarkets could do worse than to start an environment friendly campaign by supplying paper bags and supporting home industry.  Plastics are a byproduct of oil and if it was not used for plastic bags it could be used for tar and we could put the tar into the potholes we are complaining about.  These are some of the simple things which we must face before we become concerned about major items, which admittedly are important and need to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of this Bill deals with the best available technology not entailing excessive costs.  &ldquo;Excessive costs&rdquo; may be construed in various ways and a more definitive definition of the term &ldquo;excessive costs&rdquo; would be &ldquo;appropriate costs&rdquo;. Section 105 (6) states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2241" /> It shall be a good defence, in a prosecution ...  for the accused to prove that</P>
    <P>(a) he took all reasonable care to prevent or limit</P>
    <P>pollution.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Local Government Water Pollution Act, 1977, has similar terminology.  Guidance is not given as to what pollution is in the context of &ldquo;all reasonable care&rdquo;.  In relation to agricultural pollution I am annoyed at the attitude to farmers who are the scapegoats. The people who talk about the ozone layer will talk about the pollution caused by farmers.  They do not know what they are talking about and they are far removed from the agricultural scene. Nobody has made a better effort than the farmers to protect the environment.  Why should they not?  It is in their best interests to do so.  The household needs the water from the stream on the farm, as do the cattle, and they need it for a farm enterprise such as a piggery and so on.</P>
    <P>Farmers have been bounded by the authorities with the powers to investigate them.  If there is a particularly wet summer there will be a flurry of activity and farms will be visited.  In a wet summer, on any farm there is bound to be spillage.  How can we prevent it? Should we put an umbrella over the farm?  The inspectors will come in and will see water flowing from the farmyard or from the field and they will run to the nearest stream and take a sample and will initiate a prosecution.  Yet the farmer, his wife and family and the contractor would be doing their best to prevent any spillage. This has happened and will happen, but the farmer is given no chance to rectify the problem.  He is prosecuted immediately.  The local authorities have a different attitude.  The local authorities will advise the farmer how to prevent this happening in the future and give reasonable time &mdash; weeks or a month or two &mdash; to put it in order.  There are other agencies in this country whose attitude is to shoot first and talk later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2242" /> Thank God we have extremely wise people sitting on the benches in the District Courts.  These cases have been brought before these learned men who have imposed the minimum penalty of £25 having heard the farmer's case and the prosecution's case.  However, the costs of bringing that case to court are outrageous &mdash; on average £750 to £1,500. That is not good enough and will not help to improve the situation that may have caused the pollution in the first place.  In that context there are many grey areas. Obviously the judge sitting on the bench was not satisfied.  The fact that he could not impose the maximum penalty of £1,000 shows that he was not satisfied that that case should have been brought. Obviously his hands were tied and he imposed the minimum penalty of £25.  In regard to the costs, is there a directive in this Bill that these people must generate their own finances to stay in existence, and is that to be done on the backs of the small farmers?  That is not on and it will not work.</P>
    <P>Recently we had a case in Cavan where a farmer defended himself using the defence that he had taken all reasonable precautions.  He felt he could defend his own case.  It was unfortunate that on the day the case was heard the judge who usually takes those cases was not available and there came a learned gentleman from this city.  He told the farmer he was a Judas, which I think was outrageous. He told the farmer that he, the farmer, was washing his hands of this problem and that he was responsible and fined him the maximum of £1,000 plus £1,500 witness expenses.  How dare that man attack or accuse a man who came to put his own case to him?  What grounds had he for doing it?  I wonder if we went to that man's back yard what would we see on a Saturday afternoon when the rubbish is being gathered?  Yet he saw fit to come to my county to belittle decent people.</P>
    <P>I would like to make this case.  There is the problem of pollution upstream. Pollution might be detected in a stream passing through a farm but that does not mean that that pollution is necessarily <Col N="2243" /> coming from the farm through which the stream runs.  It could be coming from upstream, but is that possibility investigated? No.  The inspectors say that the farmer is responsible for the streams or rivers running through his farm.  That is no acceptable.  It is the same as a public road.  Is a farmer responsible for the traffic running on the public road that passes through his farm?  He certainly is not. The local authority is responsible.</P>
    <P>A farmer cannot police the rivers and streams going through his farm.  They are of benefit and he wants to see that they are kept clean.  If somebody upstream is polluting them, surely he should not be held responsible.  I would like that area to be cleared up because prosecutions have been brought on the evidence of finding pollution in a sample of water with no evidence where the pollution came from.  Now that this Bill is coming in, I hope we will take a different approach so that we would not be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and would give all reasonable help to people to deal with whatever problem exists.</P>
    <P>A decade ago farmers were given grants to construct silage slabs and cubicle houses.  Grants were paid and inspections carried out and everything was above board.  Ten years later we realised that that was not sufficient to prevent pollution.  In many cases the concrete used was not of a standard to withstand the wear and tear of acids from silage making.  I would ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to suggest that grant aid to be given for the reconstruction of those silage layers.  It may mean laying an extra layer of concrete or building an inner wall, but I do not think the farmer should be denied grants to bring about improvements he knows are necessary but that he cannot afford because of the exorbitant cost.  At present no such grant aid is available.  It should be made available, otherwise makeshift repair jobs will be carried out which will not suffice.  It would be much better to grant aid a proper job.</P>
    <P>Sections 39 and 108 concern the right of the public to access to information on <Col N="2244" /> the environment.  A definition is given in the Bill as to what constitutes &ldquo;information on the environment&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;water, atmosphere, soil, fauna, flora, land and natural sites&rdquo;.  This should read &ldquo;waters&rdquo; as defined in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 section 1:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Waters&rdquo; include any or part of any river, stream, lake, canal, reservoir, aquifer, pond, watercourse or other inland waters, whether natural or artificial.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that this defintion of &ldquo;waters&rdquo; includes aquifers.  These are one of Ireland's major resources and are vulnerable to pollution from a variety of sources ranging from effluent from agricultural activities to leachate from landfill sites.  They are also a major source of drinking water and results from analysis by the local authority or the agency should be available to the public.</P>
    <P>Also under sections 39 and 65 the agency is not obliged to make available confidential information.  When the EC Directive on the Freedom of Access to Information on the Environment comes into place on 1 January 1993, will these sections become obsolete?</P>
    <P>Section 60 (2) concerns landfill sites for waste disposal.  No mention is made of vermin control at landfill sites.  This is a very important issue in populated areas and it should be a procedure adopted by either the local authority in the area or the agency.  That is a major problem. Rodents will appear at such sites and it is not good enough that they are not controlled.  It is a simple enough exercise and it should be part of the law that they be controlled at these sites.</P>
    <P>Section 61 (3) (a), (b) and (c) relates to the overseeing of local authorities by the agency.  Where the agency is of the opinion that a local authority is not complying with the directions under paragraph (a), the agency shall carry out such functions and the cost of such actions be recovered by the agency from the local authority.  But the agency will not give direction unless these funds are available. Will this mean that a local authority can cause an emission to pollute because it <Col N="2245" /> did not have the funds to seek advice from the agency?</P>
    <P>A recent survey of aluminium levels in Irish drinking water concluded that of the 26 counties analysed, only three counties were within the EC Directive on the Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption.  The maximum allowable levels for aluminium were breached by 12 counties.  If funds were available to a local authority this problem should be the first tackled.  The direction of the agency should be given to the local authorities free of charge.  In relation to aluminium in our water I understand that the purpose of it is to clean the water.  It then make its way into the spoilage from the water and has to be disposed of.  I would like to know what happens when this waste is disposed of.</P>
    <P>Section 64 mentions the establishment of an accreditation scheme within the agency's laboratories or laboratories operated by local authorities or other laboratories that submit data to the agency.  Many independent and local authorities laboratories in Ireland will find it difficult to obtain this accreditation within approximately one year of the agency being established.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take on board these few remarks I have jotted down here and consider the problem of treatment of farmers who are taking all reasonable care.  I would ask the Minister to give them favourable consideration when we come to further examination of the Bill.</P>

      <P>the Minister for Defence if he will outline (1) the number of vacancies for commandant and lieutenant colonel which existed in Na Buan Óglaigh on 7 October 1991, (2) the method whereby these vacancies will be filled, (3) the criteria which will be adopted, (4) when the promotion boards will be established and whether a non-military member will be on the interview panel, (5) the number of acting commandants and lieutenant colonels currently serving in the Defence Forces, (6) whether they will be obliged to compete at these interviews and (7) when the promotion lists are expected to be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Daly) Minister for Defence (Mr. Daly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces recommended that the system of promotion formerly in operation in the Permanent Defence Forces, which was based almost exclusively on seniority, should be changed to a system based on merit and that promotion boards should be set up to assess and interview candidates. Earlier this year vacancies for brigadier-general and for colonel were filled by means of promotion boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions are now continuing between the military authorities and RACO with the objective of further <Col N="2247" /> implementing the Gleeson Commission's recommendations on promotions within officer ranks.  The talks include such matters as the criteria to be adopted for promotion and the composition of interview boards.  When the talks have been completed further promotion competitions will be held.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the discussions are proceeding satisfactorily and provide the correct forum in which the views of officers generally can be made known to the military authorities through their elected representatives.</P>
    <P>On 7 October 1991 there were 13 vacancies for lieutenant-colonels and no vacancy for commandant.  At present the strength of lieutenant-colonels is 140 against an establishment of 428.  There are 22 acting lieutenant-colonels and 118 acting commandants at the moment in the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree in relation to the promotions made earlier this year that the method adopted was not satisfactory and that the recommendation of the Gleeson Commission was literally plucked out of their report without any consideration being given to the criteria which should be adopted and the composition of the interview board?  Does the Minister feel that an injustice was done on that occasion? Now that discussions are taking place in relation to further promotions does the Minister intend to have that matter reviewed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the promotions made earlier this year were broadly welcomed within the Defence Forces and that the highest of standards were maintained.  I would like to take this opportunity to compliment and thank Mr. Wright and Mr. Boland who helped in arranging the promotions which were widely welcomed.  I admit that there was some anxiety when the decision was taken to change over from the system which had been in existence for a long time to the new arrangement but I think the association also welcome and favour <Col N="2248" /> the new system.  Apart from the details I have outlined it would be the view of the associations, personnel in the Department and in the Army that the new system is far superior and will in the long term make for better Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to outline to the House the new criteria recommended by the Gleeson Commission?  Can the Minister give us any indication of what is involved and what line the discussions are taking in relation to this matter?  There is serious concern among commandants, lieutenant-colonels and those in line for promotion right down to the rank of first-lieutenant as to what the future holds for them in the Army.  Can the Minister allay their anxiety by giving us some indication as to what the criteria are?  The difficulty is that there has been a change over from one system to another without any indication being given of what the criteria are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said.  Discussions between RACO and the military authorities are continuing.  There were meetings on 1, 9, 10 and 16 October and further meetings are planned.  While discussions are taking place between the association and the military authorities it would be unwise of me to make any comment except to say that overall the system is a good one and can work satisfactorily to the benefit of the Defence Forces.  I urge the military authorities and the association to reach a conclusion on what criteria should be put in place.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>whether he plans to initiate or publish a Green Paper on (a) the role, (b) function, (c) activities and (d) UN and NATO obligations or potential obligations of the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The roles, functions and activities of the Defence Forces are already well established.  For many years past, their main preoccupations have been aid to the civil power; fishery surveillance and protection; search and rescue, and UN peace-keeping.  A major study is at present under way in relation to the establishment, numbers and deployment of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2250" /> Aid provided to the civil power consists mainly of assistance to the Garda Síochána in the Border area and military escorts for cash in transit and civilian prisoners.</P>
    <P>As regards UN peace-keeping, 832 military personnel are currently serving in ten missions in a total of 18 countries, mainly in Lebanon.  Service with UN missions is covered by the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not a member of NATO and does not propose to join that organisation. As has frequently been stated in this House, if, in the fullness of time, the European Community were to develop its own defence arrangements, we in Ireland would certainly consider participation. This has been the position of successive Irish Governments.</P>
    <P>As a member state of the European Community, we are already committed to the co-ordination of foreign policy provided for in European Political Co-operation. Under the terms of the Single European Act, which were endorsed by referendum here in 1987, this co-ordination now extends to the political and the economic but not to the military aspects of security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a rather piecemeal approach to a much wider problem.  Is the Minister aware of the developments taking place in America, the USSR and European countries in regard to the role and reform of defence forces?  The Gleeson Commission stated they were presented with an agenda of issues which had accumulated over 60 years and will the Minister accept that he has a duty to define the function and role of the Defence Forces from now into the next century?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think in the time available to us we could go into the role and function of the Defence Forces. There is no question that we are going through a period of major change in relation to policy matters and defence policy inside and outside the Community. These are dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In relation to the <Col N="2251" /> overall role of the Defence Forces in the future, a number of very important reports have been published some of which are the subject of questions which we will deal with later.  There will be no delay in facing up to the rapidly changing circumstances, political and otherwise, as far as the Department of Defence are concerned.  I will certainly be keeping abreast of developments and will take whatever action is necessary to ensure that we have a Defence Force capable of responding in positive and speedy fashions to the demands made on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the problems identified by the Gleeson report, which stated that they had accumulated over 60 years and that the Department were aware of the shortcomings.  The report also stated that an emphasis for pressure for a change needed to come from outside the Defence Forces.  Given international developments, it is up to the Minister and the House to push for that change.  In the interest of an overall efficient service the piecemeal approach and the reviews are totally unacceptable.</P>

We are working steadily towards the implementation of those recommendations and at present something like 75 per cent of them have been almost totally implemented.  We also have the efficiency audit group report, the subject of other questions, which gives a mandate and role for the future development of the Defence Forces generally. There is no shortage of documentation and I do not know whether a Green Paper, a White Paper, or whatever the Deputy has in mind, would add to the debate.</P>

      <P>A total of £1,348,713 in revenue was derived from sales of properties by my Department in 1990.  The anticipated revenue from sales of properties in 1991 is £500,000.  As a very large number of transactions are involved, I will communicate further details to the Deputy as soon as possible.  The properties for which sale contracts have been entered into this year are: 6.3 acres at Coolmoney, County Wicklow; 4.76 acres at Kilpedder, County Wicklow; 1.9 acres adjoining the new motorway at the Curragh, County Kildare; Officers' Quarters, Clonmel, County Tipperary; 14 married quarters (purchase scheme).  The total revenue to be derived from the above is £223,500.</P>
      <P>The question of the disposal of properties which become surplus to my Department's requirement is kept under continuous review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>A Dauphin helicopter will be located at Cork in the near future, primarily for operation with <i>LE Eithne.</i>  The helicopter will also be available for search and rescue purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it was previously stated in the House that the helicopter would be located at Cork in the early part of this year on the <i>LE Eithne</i> to provide the necessary protection for our fisheries? What is causing the delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the Dauphin helicopter will be located in Cork in the very near future.  However, before the helicopter is permanently located on the <i>LE Eithne</i> a certain amount of training has to be undertaken.  That training has been going on for the past number of months and we are now in a position to relocate the helicopter.  The Deputy will be aware that a new search and rescue service was provided in Shannon which enabled us to move the helicopher based there to Finner Camp, which helped the whole service.  We now have a very efficient and effective service and it is hoped that the helicopter can be located in Cork almost immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dauphin helicopter costs £20 million and the <i>LE Eithne</i> is one of the most sophisticated ships in our fleet; they complement one another and were basically built for one another.  Will the Minister agree that part of his difficulties stems from the fact that there is a shortage of skilled technicians and pilots because of the attraction of industries elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Our full fleet of equipment, helicopters and surveillance craft is capable of being fully manned by our present staff.  I am not sure of the situation in <Col N="2256" /> regard to the new search and rescue service at Shannon; that is a separate matter which is looked after by the Department of the Marine.  But, as I said, we have adequate staff to deal with our helicopters. We also have people who had left the service some time ago coming back to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain why there is a delay if the skilled staff are available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>These aircraft and vessels &mdash; the <i>LE Eithne</i> was purchased a number of years ago &mdash; complement each other.  It seems that, given weather conditions such as prevailed last night, the lives of many people might be at risk today or in the future if the <i>LE Eithne</i> and the helicopter crews are not available. Unless something is done rapidly we will be blamed for neglecting our duty to seafarers in the main.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully conscious of the demands on the search and rescue service. This service has been greatly enhanced in the last few years.  The new marine service which has been set up in Shannon by the Department of the Marine enhances the overall service and it is much better now than ever before.  I take this opportunity of complimenting the staff on their skill, ability and expertise in dealing with a number of serious incidents that have occurred, especially in recent times.  These people are fully trained and are quite capable of dealing with any emergency that might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that over the recent fishing season in particular our fisheries were not protected as adequately as they would have been if a helicopter was placed on one of the naval vessels, and that the continued delay in providing a helicopter <Col N="2257" /> further hinders the protection of our fisheries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can safely say that the fisheries are better protected now than ever before.  The recent acquisition of the Casa has proved a major success. Indications are that a number of apprehensions have taken place through the use of the Casa.  A number of vessels, both foreign and Irish, have been detained for illegal activity and this indicates clearly the success of the surveillance service.  The Dauphin and the <i>LE Eithne</i> should certainly enhance the service further.  There is now a very capable overall service in operation in the surveillance and fisheries protection area and indeed with the search and rescue service.  It is far superior to the service that operated two or three years ago.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any plans to revise the current policy of one week's annual training camp for the FCA; his views on whether it is possible to implement an effective training programme which would normally include range practices and that the standard of training for the force has suffered badly as a result of this continuing policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 63 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>Defence Force Regulations provide that members of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí may, with their own consent, be required to attend in each training year for a course of training for a continuous period of not less than seven days, and not more than 21 days, in the case of the FCA, or not more than 14 days in the case of An Slua Muirí, at such times and places as the relevant military authorities may determine. While members who wish to attend for such training are facilitated as far as possible many, due to business or other commitments, are unable to make themselves available.</P>
      <P>Since 1983, it has been found necessary, as part of the Government's programme for achieving reductions in the level of public expenditure, to curtail annual training for members of the Reserve having regard to the provisions in the Defence Vote for the training of the Reserve.  Accordingly, each year since 1983 the annual training period for members of the FCA and the Slua Muirí has been reduced to seven days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to annual training is kept under review with the objective of restoring the normal arrangements as soon as circumstances allow.  I am satisfied that a satisfactory standard of training is being maintained.  During 1990 about 8,070 members of the FCA and <Col N="2259" /> Slua Muirí attended for courses of annual training and instruction and a further 2,500 performed casual security duties.</P>
    <P>A gratuity is issued to members of the FCA and Slua Muirí who complete a course of annual training or other full-time instruction and in addition they are paid at the same rates of pay as those that apply to corresponding ranks in the Permanent Defence Force.  In addition to attendance at such training or instruction it is necessary for each member to have attended certain local training parades or their equivalent in field days, overnight camps or security duties in order to qualify for payment of the gratutity.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the reduced period of annual training that has applied in the case of the FCA and Slua Muirí since 1983 the gratuity payable to qualified members who complete the maximum permissible period of training is at the full rate, and not at the reduced rate that would normally apply in respect of attendance for the shorter period.  The same arrangements apply this year.</P>
    <P>The current cost of annual training is estimated at just over £2 million approximately and the estimated additional cost of restoring the normal annual training arrangements would also be £2 million approximately.  It is not possible to compute the additional cost of rations and other costs as they are not accounted for separately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the detailed response from the Minister the fact remains that there are men with many years' service and the required attendance record who have been deprived of going to camp due to financial restraints.  May I ask the Minister whether those people will receive their gratutity and when was the gratuity last increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that it is desirable that training be extended from seven to 14 days &mdash; this is one of the objectives that we will endeavour to meet &mdash; but it is not possible financially to do so in the present climate.  I would be less <Col N="2260" /> than honest if I was to come in here and make promises that we cannot fulfil.  We have to curtail expenditure and we do not have the money to extend the training period.  However, we are satisfied that the training being provided is adequate to deal with the situation.  I do not have the information as to when the gratuities were last increased but I will communicate that information to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the economic aspects of this matter, as one who served for 29 years in the Reserve Defence Force I can tell the Minister that one week's training is a worthless exercise.  That is recognised by all ranks within the force and has been so since 1983.  I cannot say that the present Minister is responsible for that position.  The measure was introduced by one of his predecessors and has been in force since then.  It is accepted that one week's training is totally inadequate, achieves virtually nothing and is, in my opinon, a waste of time and effort on the part of the Force.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter.  I think Paddy Donegan was the last Minister to extend the training period.  At that stage the FCA received three or four weeks training.  Considering the assistance they have to give to the Permanent Defence Force, would the Minister not agree that they could not possibly reach the required standard in rifle marksmanship and weaponry with one week's annual training?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that annual training has been reduced does not mean there is any lack of appreciation on my part or on the part of the Department of the voluntary effort of the members and the contributions they make in their regular attendance at local training and other activities.  As I have said, to restore the additional seven days' training would cost in the region of £2 million and it is not possible to provide that money in the present financial climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the very low morale that exists <Col N="2261" /> in the FCA due to the fact that, first, there are only seven days annual training and, second, despite the Minister's statement that some people are unable to avail of the training because of business or other commitments, quite a number of people are unable to avail of even the seven days annual training because they do not have the necessary finance?  As regards those who take up the training is the Minister aware that they do not have the ammunition to do the manoeuvres and undertake the necessary training?  Is the Minister aware that during one manoeuvre in the Glen of Imaal they were shouting &ldquo;bang bang&rdquo; because they did not have ammunition? That is a fact.  That is an awful reflection on the FCA.  Does the Minister not agree that at a time when the subversive organisations are recruiting members around the country that the FCA should be in a position to recruit these young men and women rather than having them channelled into subversive organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

I had a meeting with some representatives of the FCA at which the initial move was made to set up the permanent association to represent the FCA.  Since that time meetings have taken place between representatives of the FCA and officials of my Department and hopefully a permanent representative organisation will be in place very soon.  I am sure that that organisation or association will be able to take up many of the issues that are presently causing some anxiety to members of the FCA and hopefully we will be able to find a solution for them.</P>

      <P>Defence Force Regulations provide for the issue of a wide range of items of clothing and necessaries to non-commissioned officers and privates of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí. These items include trousers &mdash; walking out and working dress &mdash; tunics &mdash; walking out and working dress &mdash; greatcoat, sweater, shirt, shoes, socks, boots, and headdress.  They are replaced at public expense when as a result of fair wear and tear they are no longer serviceable.</P>
      <P>Members of the First Line Reserve, on transfer from the Permanent Defence Force, retain the clothing that was issued to them as members of the PDF and as items become unserviceable through fair wear and tear they are also replaced at public expense.</P>

    <P>Regulations also provide for the issue of additional items such as trousers, tunic, shirts, socks, boots, etc. to NCOs and privates of the FCA who are employed <Col N="2265" /> on security duties for a continuous period of not less than 14 days' duration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation on the ground is not in accordance with the Minister's reply.  Would the Minister not agree that it is an utter disgrace that young men and women, who in many cases are unemployed or students, and carrying out voluntary duty for the State should be required to purchase their own clothing to keep themselves warm while on duty? In fact this is what is happening.  They are not getting their full entitlement to clothing and in many cases they have to purchase their own clothing to keep themselves warm.</P>

      <P>In 1980, as a result of a major review of the FCA uniforms, a new uniform was provided for members.  Up until then the uniform consisted of a jacket and some other articles of clothing which were on general issue to the members of the PDF.  The question of issuing of new items of uniform to members of the FCA is kept under constant review within the existing financial constraints I mentioned earlier.  Whenever circumstances permit new or extra articles of uniform are made available to members.  For example, in 1990, in conjunction with the issue of a working dress, a sweater was made available to members.  All articles of clothing issued to the FCA are of the same in pattern and quality as that on issue to their PDF counterparts.  There has been a great improvement in relation to clothing.  I have quite an amount of detail here which I will communicate to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 23 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efficiency audit group have presented their report to the Taoiseach and it has been accepted.  The report covers the main activities of the Department and makes recommendations.  The efficiency audit group recommended that an implementation group should be set <Col N="2267" /> up to press ahead with the implementation of its proposals, the implementation group to include an assistant secretary from the Department of Finance, Chairman; an assistant secretary from the Department of Defence and the Quartermaster-General.  The implementation group has been set up.</P>
    <P>The efficiency audit group also recommended the establishment of a review team to examine the administrative structures and systems within the Defence Forces.  This team has been set up and its terms of reference include:</P>
    <P>1.  (a)  a review of the organisational arrangements, including structures, for carrying out Defence Forces administration functions, in order to facilitate the most efficient management of resources, with a view to securing economies by providing services more efficiently and at a lower cost and with particular reference to the geographical command structures and to concerns about the number of military personnel engaged in administrative duties;</P>
    <P>(b)  in the context of 1 (a), a review of present Defence Forces administrative systems, including purchasing and personnel, in order to minimise the number of approval steps and, in general, to simplify procedures and secure economies;</P>
    <P>2.  a review of the arrangements for financial management and delegation within the Defence Forces with a view to the introduction and operation of new financial management systems to ensure better value for money;</P>
    <P>3.  a review of the present information technology for the defence area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This represents a major change in defence policy.  Does the Minister agree with what is proposed?  Do the Taoiseach and the Government agree with the proposals?  Does the Minister accept that this new policy is effectively taking responsibility out of the Minister's <Col N="2268" /> hands as the person accountable to the House and the public and putting it into the hands of the Chief of Staff?  Will the Chief of Staff now be answerable to the Committee of Accounts for such decisions?  Grave concern has been expressed by the public.  Will the Minister reconsider what is being proposed because there are major implications involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this is a major report.  The conclusions of the EAG report have been outlined in detail and circulated to the unions and others involved.  The EAG were determined to ensure that three fundamental principles should apply: 1, that the constitutional and legal provisions to ensure civil control of the Defence Forces must not be weakened in any area; 2, that the changes proposed should enhance the role of the Minister for Defence as head of the Department, particularly in relation to the functions of securing good government and efficiency as outlined in the Defence Forces Act, 1954 and 3, that there should be no dimunition in the present level of financial control exercised by or accountability to Dáil Éireann, the Government, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Defence. The report sets out in some detail the way that should be proceeded with.  The EAG recommended the setting up of an implementation group that would put into operation the recommendations of the EAG.  As I said, that has been set up and the group have communicated with the various interests involved.  I am satisfied that the implementation of the recommendations of the EAG can make for a more efficient, more effective and better service generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to provide the Opposition spokespersons with a copy of the EAG report.  I should also like to ask the Minister if in relation to the report he is satisfied that the Chief of Staff and Army personnel will have the authority to dispose of Department of Defence property. I understand that one <Col N="2269" /> recommendation is that they should have the power of sale of Department of Defence property.  Has that matter been considered by Cabinet?  Is the Minister satisfied with that recommendation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider it would be worth while for the Deputy to have a copy of the report.  As the Deputy knows, the report was commissioned by the Taoiseach. I shall advise the Taoiseach's Department of the Deputy's request that copies of the report be circulated.  It is very detailed and comprehensive and deals with several important matters.  It sets down a formula under which future development of policy and other issues can be dealt with.  It would be premature to discuss the report in the Dáil without Deputies first being fully aware of its contents.  For that reason it is advisable that Deputies have the report available to them and, perhaps, it might be placed in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report makes recommendations such as a major strengthening of the secretariat's audit function; the elimination of the present seven-day notice of audit requirement for access to military information and facilities and a new emphasis on defence policy within the secretariat. The absence of an overall defence policy has been criticised in the House on numerous occasions by Deputies from both sides of the House.  Other recommendations are: retention by the secretariat of the responsibility for major procurements; an extension of administrative budgets to the military, which is felt desirable; and rapid progress in the introduction of computerisation.  We have substantial numbers in the military, in the Reserve and in the Department rapid progress towards computerisation is vital for the better management, organisation and efficiency of the Department generally.  A long term training initiative for the secretariat and the military is also recommended.  The report also covers other matters that would bring about overall effectiveness and efficiency in the Department and the military.  It has been pointed out by the EAG in their report that efficiency and effectiveness would <Col N="2270" /> most certainly not be served if the working group's recommendations were to result in reducing one level of bureaucracy and replacing it by another, and that is why the review to which I referred in my reply has also been established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The PDF have long since called for a review of the administration <i>vis-á-vis</i> Coláiste Caoimhín and the Defence Forces.  I do not consider it is a matter of what is in the report but what will happen to the report.  While the British Parliament, for example, has within it a Defence Committee which liaise between the PDF &mdash; the various elements of the Defence Forces &mdash; and Parliament we do not have such a committee here. Will the Minister indicate when he will be able to circulate copies of the report for discussion.  Will the various representative organisations within the PDF be given an opportunity to consider the implications of the report?  What effect will its recommendation have on the administration now performed by Coláiste Caoimhín?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially a working party review was published some time in March.  At that stage I received representation from and met the various associations.  When the final report of the Efficiency Audit Group was brought to my attention I instructed that the associations and unions involved be provided with copies of the report.  I understand that has happened.  I hope it will be possible to put copies in the Library soon.  The report contains far-reaching conclusions. It set down a time schedule by which some of the issues should be dealt with and implemented.  If the Deputy fears that the report will be allowed to lie without any action being taken on it, I can tell him that the implementation group to give effect to the report's recommendation has been established.  That group includes a representative of the Department of Finance, the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Defence and the Quarter-Master General.  The implementation group have indicated to the associations and the unions involved <Col N="2271" /> that they are willing and anxious to discuss the implications of the report, and I understand that will get under way fairly soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fundamental question, on the basis of media reports, the Taoiseach and Government have agreed to this.  Will the Minister confirm that this proposal is off the cuff?  Does he agree that it will not be operative as far as trade unionists and many people in the Defence Forces are concerned since it always had been Government policy that military should be subject to the closest possible civilian control whereas the Minister is giving such civilian control back to the Chief of Staff, which is totally unacceptable.  Will legislative change be necessary?  If so, will the Minister say under what Bill heading it will be introduced? In view of the widespread implications in an area of particular public concern will the Minister commit himself to having that report published so that there can be a full debate in this Chamber in relation to it before being implemented by Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There may well be legislative changes required to give effect to some of the recommendations of the Efficiency Audit Group report.  One point to which particular attention was drawn by the Efficiency Audit report was that which I have already quoted here: that the constitutional and legal provisions to ensure civil control of the Defence Forces are not weakened in any way.  While the report is now at the stage of implementation I would expect it to be the subject of fairly detailed negotiations and discussion before final decisions are taken in that regard.</P>

      <Quest>if he has any proposals to hand over to Dublin Corporation the Esplanade field which is part of Collins Barracks so as to enable Dublin Corporation prepare a secure and well-located camping site for visitors to Dublin which would ensure that the regrettable instance which took place in the Phoenix Park could be avoided and that Dublin city would, under the supervision of Dublin Corporation, be in a position to offer secure and well located modern camping facilities as an integral part of Dublin's tourist infrastructure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be horrified if the Minister were to consider disposing of this field to Dublin Corporation for the purpose outlined in the question because it would be the most inappropriate location for a tourist camping site.  We are talking about Collins Barracks, a magnificent building, partly because of the vista it affords across the Liffey, across the field in question and the magnificence of the buildings themselves.  Is the Minister aware of any interest on the part of Dublin Corporation to use this field as a tourist camping site?  As a member of the City Council certainly I am not aware that they have expressed any such interest.  Indeed I would be disappointed and surprised if any planner in Dublin Corporation were to contemplate <Col N="2274" /> applying to anybody to have this site used as a camping site.  I do want to record my concurrence with the view that there is urgent need to have a tourist camping site made available.  For example, a suitable location might be found within the Phoenix Park itself to be organised by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have received no such proposals.  I suggest that perhaps Deputy Byrne would use his good offices in Dublin Corporation to ascertain what they have in mind.  The Government decided in December 1988 that Collins Barracks should be disposed of and that the troops stationed there be located elsewhere.  The property, including the esplanade, consisting of a five-acre open space fronting on to the quays, comprises an overall area of some 19 acres.  In February 1990 the Government approved a plan to relocate the personnel accommodated in Collins Barracks in new, refurbished accommodation in McKee Barracks and Cathal Brugha Barracks. Progress towards an early evacuation of Collins Barracks, however, has been impeded because of the difficulty in having the new accommodation provided. It is expected that Collins Barracks will be offered for sale by public tender following evacuation &mdash; that is at this time &mdash; and any appropriate public uses of part of the property, if there is demand for such, will be considered within the overall plans for disposal of the property. The esplanade is zoned K, open space, in the 1987 draft Dublin city development plan.  What is normally permissible in zone K is open space, recreational buildings and halting sites.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give the House an outline of the plans for the disposal of the site?  As the Minister quite rightly said, we were told on 25 October 1990 that by the end of December 1991, approximately, the site would be vacated.  Can the Minister inform the House when he envisages the military <Col N="2275" /> personnel will have been evacuated from Collins Barracks?</P>

Would the Minister give serious consideration to having the hangar-workshop connected to the gas supply I understand to be available at the camp?

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the response to recruitment campaigns for cadets in the Army and Naval Service; if, in view of the reportedly poor response, he intends to review recruitment procedures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of applications for Army and Naval Services cadetships in 1991 was higher than in each of the previous two years.  I think the point the Deputy was making in his question was that for some reason there was no interest in Army cadetships.  I should say that we have more applications than we can <Col N="2277" /> handle.  I can give the Deputy the exact figures.  In 1988, for example, there were 1,017 applications for cadetships whereas in 1991 we had 1,213 applications for 30 places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The question attempts to address the recruitment policy of the Naval Service and the Army.  There are reports of huge disappointment due to the lack of response to the recruitment campaign.  Despite 12 vacancies for cadets in the Naval Service, they failed to find a single suitable applicant.  Similar difficulties were experienced in regard to Army cadets.  There are reports that military people are extremely disappointed and worried that the image of both the Army and the Naval Service is poor compared with the image of the Garda Síochána.  That problem must be addressed very quickly if they are to attract the right people to both services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was whether I was satisfied with the response to the campaign.  For the 30 vacancies in the Army this year we had 1,213 applications. There were ten vacancies in the Naval Service, for which there were 417 applications.  Last year we had 309 applications. The number of inquiries is going up rather than down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the problem relates not so much to a poor image as to the restriction on filling vacancies.  The vacancies are not being filled because of lack of finance and lack of support rather than lack of interest.  A restriction on filling vacancies has been imposed by the Chief of Staff and by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 40 cadetships have been awarded in 1991, which is broadly in line with the number of awards in the past few years.  Thirty cadets were recruited to the Army, including six females, and ten to the Navel Service. No competition for Air Corps cadetships was held in 1991 because it is proposed to hold a competition in 1992 under revised conditions.  It is hoped that the Air Corps <Col N="2278" /> cadets will commence training at the same time as if they had been taken in this year.  If the Deputy requires any further details, I will be able to supply them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister tell me that he is happy with recruitment to the Army and Naval Service?  The figures speak for themselves.  Last year 1,200 young people responded to advertisements for cadetships in the Army; that represents a 33 per cent drop over the previous year.  We must compare that with the number of applicants to join the Garda Síochána.  For 1,000 places in the Garda Síochána there were 22,000 applicants. The country is riddled with unemployment. Thousands of skilled personnel are drawing the dole who could be employed by the Army but they still find it unattractive.  Will the Minister elaborate on why he thinks the response is so low?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The response is upwards. The Deputy seems to have the wrong figures.  This year we had 1,213 applications for 30 positions as Army cadets. Last year we had 909 applications.  I have to be satisfied with that response.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with an EC approved programme a contract was placed in April 1991 for the purchase of an existing CASA CN 235 aircraft.  This aircraft was <Col N="2279" /> delivered in early June 1991 and is engaged on fisheries surveillance duties.</P>
    <P>The contract also provided for the purchase of two new CASA CN 235 maritime patrol aircraft for the purpose of aerial surveillance of fisheries resources. The new aircraft are scheduled for delivery in early 1994.</P>
    <P>The EC programme provides for a maximum refund of 50 per cent of expenditure incurred.  An amount of £3,519,000 approximately has been refunded by the EC in 1991 in respect of the purchase of maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the main problem in relation to Air Corps aircraft is that most of them have reached the end of their active service life and that replacement aircraft will have to be secured to maintain the level of service provided by the Air Corps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the aircraft have reached maximum serviceability and this is why we placed a contract for the purchase of two new CASA which are due in early 1994.  Another CASA came into operation in June and has been very effective in surveillance activities.  The result can be seen in the number of foreign vessels which have been apprehended since that plane came into service.  It has been highly successful.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received any representations from the crew of the Department of Defence ferry William J, which is used for ferrying personnel to and from Haulbowline, regarding working conditions on the boat; if he plans to take steps to have the working conditions improved and the health and safety standards brought up to an acceptable level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations were received regarding the <i>William J</i> from the union representing the crew and the matter was examined by the Department.</P>
      <P>The vessel <i>William J</i> was hired by the Department for use as a garrison launch to provide passenger service between Haulbowline and Cobh during August and September 1991 while the Department's own launch, the <i>David F</i>, was undergoing a major overhaul.  The Department of Marine certified that the <i>William J</i> was fit to carry passengers and crew and that the vessel complied with all safety conditions, such as lifesaving apparatus, hull condition, firefighting and pumping arrangements, etc.</P>
      <P>The <i>William J</i> was returned to its owners after the Department's own vessel, the <i>David F</i>, became fully operational again on 30 September 1991.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>William J</i> carried 1,000 people per day.  The vessel had no washing, heating or eating facilities and did not, therefore, comply with EC health and safety law.  Only half the crew had been provided with life saving gear. The <i>David F</i> is now operating the same ferry service and, unfortunately, the people who are operating it find that the conditions have not been improved.  It does not have heating, eating or toilet facilities.  The employees are very diligent and work unsocial hours but their rate of pay, which was associated with the <Col N="2281" /> building trade, is out of line because they have not been granted the increases recently paid to builders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which indicates the priority the Government are giving to environmental matters. Indeed, this is a common theme throughout Europe at present where <Col N="2343" /> environmental matters are becoming more and more important.  We have not been slow to follow that trend and in some cases to lead it.  This Bill is a further step in that process.</P>
      <P>Both this Government and the previous Government have good records in the area of environmental protection. They have introduced a number of Acts &mdash; for example, the Water Pollution Act and the Air Pollution Act.  The Minister of State has also taken action to resolve the smog problem in Dublin.  Last year the Government published an action plan for the environment.  This is probably one of the most significant documents published by the Department of the Environment during the past decade.  It is important to note that not only did the Government outline their aspirations in relation to the environment in that document but they also provided the money to implement those aspirations and ideas. A further aspect of that document is that it has allowed local authorities to plan ahead.  I can cite the example of Meath County Council who have gone to the Department on the basis of the plan and outlined their needs.  They have been told well in advance that funding will be available in 1991, 1992 or 1993 and they can go ahead with the planning of sewerage and water schemes.  This very important change in the Government's attitude has meant that local authorities no longer have to work in the dark.  One could wait for ten years for a sewerage or a water scheme or some anti-pollution measure, without approval in principle or otherwise from the Department and suddenly be told towards the end of a financial year: &ldquo;X amount of money is left, we will give you the go ahead&rdquo; and the necessary planning would not be done.  That environmental plan was very important and I compliment the Ministers and the Department involved for putting it forward and also the new attitude within the Department where people are told in advance to plan ahead for 1991, 1992, 1993 and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give a general welcome to the Bill. Most people have welcomed it.  Possibly <Col N="2344" /> many people have welcomed it because they have some vague notion that if it is an Environmental Protection Agency it will protect the environment; so, therefore, the Bill must be good.  It conjures up all sorts of visions of a concerned society seeking to protect the natural environment and even visions of knights in shining armour tackling the big bad world of pollution.  Because of that everybody will welcome it.  Perhaps we should query whether in itself it is a good thing or why is it necessary that we should have an Environmental Protection Agency?  We should ask ourselves the question: why do we need this agency or, more basically, do we need an Environmental Protection Agency? Have our local authorities not been given the task of environmental protection? Should they not be environmental protection agencies?  We have 87 local authorities and if they are not environmental protection agencies we should ask ourselves why.  Why is it the perception among the general public that local authorities are not fulfilling their role as protectors of the environment? Heretofore, one of the reasons for that perception was the lack of funds given to the local authorities by the Department of the Environment.  Thankfully, as I have indicated at the outset, that has changed for the better over the last number of years, even to the extent of indicating that funds will be available at some future date which allows the planning to go ahead.</P>
    <P>However, much damage was done in the past to local authorities because they were not getting the funds.  We have examples in every county in Ireland where local authorities are the biggest polluters in their own local authority areas.  It is very difficult for a local authority to police environmental matters when the local authority are guilty of pollution.  Local authorities had no credibility in that area.  That is one reason for the public perception that local authorities are not doing their job for the environment.  The second reason is that, as I have indicated over the past three or four years, the laws <Col N="2345" /> which existed previously were totally inadequate.  It was very difficult for local authorities &mdash; and still is in some instances &mdash; to obtain a prosecution in relation to pollution offences.  That has improved, but there is still a long way to go.  It is damaging to local authorities that the legislation is not sufficiently tight to allow them to prosecute and to do so more regularly.  A third reason &mdash; and one which is understandable at a time when jobs are scarce &mdash; is that in the past local authorities did not put the environment first but rather put the possibility of jobs at the top of their agenda.  As a result, in some cases environmental issues were ignored and local authorities lost credibility.  It led to many problems and much local confrontation that the local authorities appeared to ignored the whole area of environmental protection.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of years I was lucky to have visited Taiwan, which is said to be one of the most advanced industrial nations in the world; they are the fifth largest trading nation in the world, about one-third the size of Ireland.  They put industry first and, unfortunately, they are reaping the harvest of that policy.  The environment is completely and totally ruined.  At the time of my visit serious consideration was being given to a whole range of environmental measures including banning cars from their capital city and various other stringent measures that would have to be taken.  If we pursue a policy of jobs first at all costs, then we could end up the same; but, as previous speakers have said, we are beginning to get the balance right.</P>
    <P>The fourth reason for saying local authorities have lacked credibility in the area of environmental protection was because of a lack of expertise within the local authorities in dealing with highly technical planning applications.  Very often the expertise they needed was not available. It is fair to say, in some cases, that some local authorities refused planning applications on the basis that they were not able to deal with them sufficiently well because of lack of expertise.  They thought that by refusing the planning permission it would be passed on to An <Col N="2346" /> Board Pleanála who might get the expertise.</P>
    <P>All of this combined has led to an undermining of public confidence in the role of local authorities in environmental protection.  That is the problem as I see it.  The question I ask is whether this Bill addresses that problem.  I have to be honest and say I am not sure it addresses it fully.  I have to ask myself whether this Bill will restore public confidence.  Will the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, as a body, restore confidence in the whole area of environmental protection?  I doubt it.  The doubt I have arises from the fact that whenever we run into a major problem in Ireland the solution is to set up a commission, a committee or work party to study or to take action on a particular area.  Very few of these bodies seem to work.</P>
    <P>I take one example from the area of planning which is closely related to the whole area of environmental protection.  In the late seventies people wanted a change in the planning system: they wanted it moved out of political control.  The solution at that time was An Bord Pleanála.  The question we should ask is whether they solved the problem we had in relation to planning.  My answer to that question is a very firm and resounding &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  There is hardly a more discredited body in the country at present than An Bord Pleanála.  Instead of improving the perception of the planning process, as it was designed to do, it has made it worse.  There are examples from other areas which I could give, but that is the most glaring example of setting up a so-called independent board which was supposed to solve the problem but did not.  I simply pose the question, because I do not want to see the same thing happening in the area of environmental protection. I see a danger arising where the Environmental Protection Agency will end up being as useless in the eyes of the public as An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>My theory in relation to many of these decision-making bodies and the decision-making process in Ireland generally is that the nearer to the people a decision <Col N="2347" /> is made the more acceptable it becomes; the converse is that the more remote the decision-making the less satisfactory it is for the people.  If less than satisfactory decisions are made, obviously they become less acceptable and that gives rise to all forms of pressure groups.  We saw that in the planning area.  Removing responsibility to so called independent groups makes our society a lot less democratic. Because it becomes less democratic we come nearer to anarchy if we continue to pursue that type of solution to problems.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade the catch-cry has been to look for independent bodies to be established.  The question I pose is &mdash; independence from whom?  I presume that what people mean when they say that &mdash; even politicians &mdash; is that they are looking for bodies to be independent from politicians.  We as politicians are doing ourselves a disservice by giving in to every call for an independent body. We have all dealt with independent bodies and the general public and we know that when the decision of the independent body is made and it does not suit a person, it is not the independent body that gets all the criticism but the politician. Politicians get it in the neck every time some so called independent body makes a decision.  We have had plenty of examples of that over the last two months.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is by way of an appeal to the Minister to ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency has a limited role.  Rather than giving them wide ranging functions and roles, the Minister should ensure that the local authorities get the finance for environmental protection work.  They should be given the funds as they have been given them over the last number of years to prevent pollution being caused by themselves and by others.  The role of the agency should be to set environmental quality objectives and standards.  The agency should have support and back up services and should provide expertise in technical areas where such expertise may not be available at local level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2348" /> I agree with the role outlined &mdash; using the agency for monitoring the impact of industry on the environment and so on &mdash; but they should not be involved in the nitty gritty of day to day environmental matters.  If they are, their effectiveness will be diluted and we will have another useless body on our hands.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the agency's role as outlined in the Bill, with which I am not at all happy, is the licensing role for certain industries.  It is a good idea for them to have an advisory role to the local authorities, as they will have the expertise, but it will cause endless problems if the Environmental Protection Agency have the licensing role separate to the local authority's role.  How would licensing work?  Would a company have to seek a licence first in relation to discharges or will they have to seek planning permission first?  If they first require the licence, then the local authority is immediately put under pressure to grant planning permission and we will hear stories of local authorities being afraid to refuse planning permission because a company had a licence and there could be a compensation claim.</P>
    <P>We will hear stories of companies having invested millions, once they got the licence, before applying for planning permission, assuming that they would automatically get planning permission. That would cause difficulties.  Alternatively, a person could first get planning permission and having spent huge sums trying to get the planning permission, carrying out environmental impact assessments and so on they could be told they cannot have a licence.  Will that also not give rise to difficulties?</P>
    <P>I know there is a co-ordinating role between the local authorities and the agency but I see a grave difficulty here. I know they will consult, but the two functions should not be separated.  I know they are separated in the legislation but that is a mistake.  The Minister should look at that.</P>
    <P>The major role of the Environmental Protection Agency should be mainly advisory and to provide expertise.  The <Col N="2349" /> Environmental Protection Agency performance should be monitored closely by the Department and the Minister in the first few years, and if they are proving successful we should then extend their role.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency should also be involved in co-ordinating environmental policy across all Departments. The Department of Agriculture and Food will have one set of anti-pollution grants, the Department of the Environment another, and perhaps the Department of Industry and Commerce yet another.  The Environmental Protection Agency should play a leading role in tying all these strands together and should produce a policy document to cover all aspects of development.</P>
    <P>Subject to the reservations I have expressed, this Bill is a move in the right direction.  I hope the agency will prove to be a lot more successful than some of the agencies set up in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which has the acceptance of all sides of the House.  It is an important Bill for a number of reasons.  In recent times there has been a growing awareness of the importance of the environment.  People are concerned by the various environmental problems in the community.  Our general awareness is manifested, for instance, in anti-litter campaigns and campaigns to keep certain areas clean.</P>
      <P>The growth of recycling co-ops throughout the country is very welcome. There is a positive attitude towards the environment and it is important that people should not be frustrated in their efforts but that they should be encouraged as much as possible.  In my own county we have led the way in setting up a recycling co-operative.  The people involved are very enthusiastic but unless they receive support from the statutory agencies, including the local councils and the Department of the Environment, they will become frustrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister is not here.  I was involved recently in trying to set up a recycling group in my home town of Listowel.  I had many problems <Col N="2350" /> getting premises as well as getting the process off the ground.  We are trying to encourage groups to do something about this, but these people should be getting more support, and the only type of support we can give them is financial support. Unless they get that their efforts will be frustrated.  I say that sincerely because I know the Minister is doing her best in this respect and has in the past aided the recycling co-op in Tralee.  The support has to be substantial to ensure the viability of these initiatives.</P>
    <P>I am also very concerned that not enough environmental awareness programmes are being introduced into our schools.  The environment should be a core subject in the curriculum of primary and secondary schools.  We need to educate our young people to respect the environment and not to litter it.  This would be possible with a positive education programme.  In the past, however, our anti-litter campaign has been carried out in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion with no continuity. There is a publicity week aimed at keeping our environment clean, but we are inclined to forget about it during the other 51 weeks of the year.  Such campaigns should be continuously reinforced so that people will bear it in mind that it is important to keep our environment clean.</P>
    <P>It should be helpful to have local cleanups involving, for example, keeping the school yard clean, because quite often the school yard is the most littered part of the community.  This implies some acceptance of litter and is the wrong attitude for young people.  An awareness of the importance of the environment should start at school and in the home and, hopefully, it will spread out to the community at large.  The schools have a very important role to play.  I know this is a different subject from the agency but it is related and it is very important.  We should have regular public education programmes in our national media and on local radio stations for the population at large.</P>
    <P>Our higher education institutions also have a major role to play by way of <Col N="2351" /> research.  They have the expertise available to them.  They have the facilities and, the laboratories, and they could do a lot more in this respect.  Two immediate examples of work being undertaken in this area come to mind.  The RTC in Sligo are doing very valuable work on ground water.  In my own college in Tralee they are doing internationally recognised work in composting and animal waste. The Minister was in Tralee some time ago and is aware of this.  These are just two examples of how our higher education institutes could become involved with effect.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned that it is very important from the point of view of tourism that we keep our environment clean.  We are lucky here in that the industrial revolution hit England and the other European countries years before it affected Ireland.  Much of the damage that has been done to our environment is not irreversible or irreparable.  We could reverse the damage and bring our rivers and lakes back to what they were with a little effort and care on the part of the population in general.</P>
    <P>I do not have to remind the House that over three million people visited Ireland in 1990.  These people are not coming for the sunshine, they are coming for fresh air, and mostly for environmental reasons.  That is something we have to sell more and more.  Compared to the environmental situation in many other countries, Ireland can still claim to be the garden of Europe.  Our lakes and rivers are largely unpolluted and the air is generally swept clean by the prevailing winds.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot be complacent.  I would like to refer briefly to the book &ldquo;Guests of the Nation&rdquo; by Robert Allen. He described how, despite planning permission, things have gone wrong for this country in the past.  He pointed out several examples, including the 1979 disaster at Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay, the Hanrahan case and several other cases.  We cannot be complacent just because we have a reasonable record.  We cannot allow the impression to be given that <Col N="2352" /> everything is well and and that we need not do anything.  Indeed, as has been pointed out by a large number of speakers, including the previous speaker, Deputy Dempsey, we have major problems and we will just have to face them. For that reason I welcome the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.</P>
    <P>There have been considerable advances in environmental law legislation here over the last few years.  The three remaining areas of environmental law that have been identified are air, waste and water.  In relation to air we have the Air Pollution Act, 1987, and this is amended by the current Bill and other Bills.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that noise has been included in this Bill as an environmental consideration as this is of growing importance to our lifestyle.  Previous speakers mentioned that smell or odour was not included.  Probably provision should have been made for this and it may be made when the Bill is amended further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the area of waste I understand that a new Act will have to be prepared to meet EC Directives and I would like the Minister to confirm this.  It is a pity we did not update our law in relation to this Act.  The existing laws in Statutory Instruments Nos. 33/1982, 390/1979 and 108/1984 are woefully inadequate.  This is generally accepted and we have been reminded of this on several occasions in our county councils.  This will be known to every member of every county council with the perpetual problem of waste disposal, landfills, etc.  In this regard I welcome section 60 of this Bill.  However, I wonder why waste management plans are not included under section 100.  Perhaps the Minister will refer to that when she replies.</P>
    <P>Regarding water, the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990, cover this area.  It too is referred to in this Bill.  We can never be complacent in regard to water pollution.  Only last week I noticed in the &ldquo;Consumer Choice&rdquo; magazine that of the 19 samples taken in County Kerry, Listowel was the only one over the aluminium sulphate <Col N="2353" /> limit.  This has disturbed many local people.  Even though we have a modern treatment plant in the town we must be forever vigilant because this is obviously not carrying out the functions we thought it would.  We still have water of inferior quality in our town despite the existence of that plant.  The message is that even though we have modern sewage treatment plants we must continue to be vigilant in regard to water quality.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions contained in Part IV of the Bill dealing with integrated pollution control even though I foresee difficulties initially with such an approach.  It is fair to say therefore that there are specific Acts and regulations in force which give wide powers to control environmental damage and that in general these are in line with the European situation.  The industrialist coming to this country is faced with the knowledge that there is an environmental regime in place while for the environmentalist &mdash; I am glad to note there is an increased concern about the environment, as I mentioned earlier &mdash; there is a readily available group of Acts and regulations which set out environmental protection rights.</P>
    <P>The rules and game are in place as laid down in the Acts which have been introduced in recent times.  What we are dealing with here today are the powers and duties of the referee, in this case the Environmental Protection Agency, who will be a standards setting and enforcement body.  They will be given wide powers by this Bill and previous Acts. Therefore they will be the cornerstone on which the Acts will operate.  If they act and work properly then the environmental regime will work properly.  It is to this concern, striking a balance between working standards and operating an environmental system properly, that my remarks will be addressed this evening.</P>
    <P>Like all legal controls and problems it is a question of getting the balance right. This matter has been referred to by most speakers.  If the balance is against industry then damage will be done in relation to a problem which is far greater in this country than anywhere else in Europe, the prospects of employment and the <Col N="2354" /> resultant problem of emigration.  If industrialists and other economic promotional and development groups find the regime too penal they will leave or not come at all.  We must have regard therefore to the other penalties against industry and development in this country &mdash; for example, our peripherality, lack of mineral and natural resources and very cruel tax regime.  These are obstacles in the way of bringing industry to this country.  We do not want to create any more.  If we do not look at the broad picture industry will not come or stay.  I am very concerned about this matter and I wish to place my concern on the record.  It would not be my wish that sacred cows about the environment would be created in the form of legal barriers to development.  There has been a tendency of late to regard environmentalists as the good guys and industrialists as the bad guys, but that is an over-simplification of the position.</P>
    <P>The function of the agency must be to protect the environment in a reasoned and reasonable way and to allow growth, which is so necessary.  There is little point in having a beautiful environment populated by rabbits only.  In a recent newspaper article somebody described the part of the country that I and my colleague, Deputy Reynolds, come from, the west, as being the wilderness west. Unfortunately, with ever increasing rapidity this is becoming true.  We may even reach the stage when we will be able to quote the poet as saying: ill fares the land, the environment is beautiful and men decay.</P>
    <P>Enforcement must always use two carrots and one stick, and no pun on the word &ldquo;rabbit&rdquo; is intended.  There are obviously going to be difficulties with established industry some of which will not have the resources to meet theoretical desirable standards.  The consideration of individual cases under section 5 of the Bill by the agency will be a matter of urgency and prime importance. While industry must act responsibly it must be allowed to remain economically viable.  That is true in the case of farming also.  I know of several farmers who will be forced out of business as a result of <Col N="2355" /> investing heavily in pollution control measures when less elaborate arrangements could have been made.  They were advised to build elaborate slatted units which cost a large amount of money, but with the fall in agricultural incomes they cannot afford them.  They will be forced out of business even though they could have resorted to more simpler arrangements. The same could happen in industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the question of standards.  The most important function of the Environmental Protection Agency will be to set standards.  What is of concern to me is that these standards are not set out in any definitive way in the Acts and are not reviewable by this House.  Ultimately, this House should be responsible to the people for industrial and other development, the protection of the environment and striking the balance between them.  The House should deal with both these aims regularly and the way in which they are balanced.  This will be a matter of particular importance during the next ten years or so in view of the rapid changes in technology, knowledge, emerging work patterns and lifestyles. Handing it over to the Environmental Protection Agency may be something of a cop-out.  It will be necessary for this House to regularly control the situation and to understand and monitor what is going on in the Environmental Protection Agency, as it should in the case of the Industrial Development Authority.  This point has been made forcibly already today by previous speakers. For example, Deputies Allen and Durkan were at pains to point this out.</P>
    <P>Will this House have any control over the activities of the Environmental Protection Agency?  It is the experience of Deputies on all sides of this House when they ask questions about the Industrial Development Authority that they are told they are not the responsibility of the Minister.  Will the Minister for the Environment tell the House in a Dáil reply after a serious disaster in some part of the country that this matter is not his responsibility?  That is not right.  We are <Col N="2356" /> the custodians of the environment and, as Deputy Dempsey said, we will be blamed eventually.  It will not be the members of the Environmental Protection Agency who will be blamed but rather the politicians, irrespective of which party they belong to.  For this reason we should monitor and control the work of the agency in the future and we should be able to raise questions in the Dáil relating to their activities.</P>
    <P>It is important that we keep control and have a say to make sure that the Environmental Protection Agency act in the national interest and are fair, just and reasonable.  That is what both lobbies, the industrial development lobby and the environmental lobby, require.  They require reasonable standards of control especially when it comes to the issuing of licences.  They want standards which are reasonable and necessary and which will be enforced impartially, properly and fully, information on these to be made available and the appeals system to operate fairly.  That is what we will have to give them.</P>
    <P>It is very important that neither side are forced to operate in isolation or are frustrated by unreasonable standards or conduct. Reasonable conduct is what everybody should require.  That would include reasonable conduct by this House in monitoring, as the ultimate democratic institution, the standards to be set.  All the Acts and regulations require that standards be set.  While they lay down general guidelines on what is important from both the industrialist's and environmentalist's point of view, it is necessary that these standards be clear, reasonable and operable.  Otherwise all these rules and regulations will be merely pieces of paper which intimidate or frustrate people.  Much work has to be done by the agency in this regard.  Not only will they have to set standards for Ireland, they will have to do so in the European context and to some extent in a world context.</P>
    <P>The directors of the agency will have much work to do.  The composition of the selection committee under section 21 causes me concern because it seems that they are all Dublin based.  There should <Col N="2357" /> not be selection on a closed shop basis of what will be seen as Dublin do-gooders &mdash; you may refer to them in whatever way you like.  In general the directors will have to deal with non-Dublin activities. It is obvious from the Bill that the directors will be living in Dublin, which goes against the whole principle of a balanced viewpoint.  One must live in a place, or at least in the region, to fully understand it.</P>
    <P>The action, or inaction, of the agency should be reviewed regularly by a committee of this House.  I hope that the operation of section 51 of the Bill will not be a mere formality and that reports are referred to an appropriate committee which should have before them the views of experts on both sides, the industrial economic developer and the environmentalists' lobby.  I would specifically include in the environmental developer group our agricultural sector as it is wrongly regarded as the ugly duckling on a number of fronts, including the environment. Deputy Boylan went to great pains to exonerate the agricultural sector from much of the blame laid at their door in the past.</P>
    <P>The committee could monitor whether standards are too rigid or too lax and they should be able to bring the matter back to this House to enforce reasonable standards. As I understand it, the present position is that standards imposed by county councils apply to fixed emissions and do not normally take into account air and other water controls.  I want to refer briefly to this area.  To give a simple example, there is in water a 20/30 standard and county councils fix a load or emissions quantity standard having regard to them.  It seems irrelevant to the council what the flow in the river is; standards are fixed which do not take account of the flow at any particular time. However, it is obvious that in a period of high water allowing considerably more effluent into the river does not do any damage.  However, an industrialist cannot do this and there should be more <Col N="2358" /> flexibility in regard to this matter.  It might be useful to be able to offload effluent at such a period so that industrialists could store it during a lower water period.  Rivers vary considerably in capacity but no account is taken of this. The industrialists obviously will be frustrated by a single standard with a single quantity objective despite variances in the surrounding circumstances.  These variations will need to be fully researched and I hope that there will be five working directors, visiting locations, listening to people and interpreting the needs of each area.  I am pleased to note that the directors will be independent and full-time. They have much to do in establishing the balance to which I referred above, industry by industry, area by area and indeed region by region.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Environmental Protection Agency will have the desired effect.  It is vitally important that we preserve and protect our environment, not just for the present generation but for future generations.  We made a major start in the last four years in bringing forward law in this House.  Now our objective should be to ensure that the law is enforced and that we have the proper resources available to us.  We should give these resources to the Environmental Protection Agency, county councils and other bodies involved in pollution control to ensure that they can put this law in place.</P>
    <P>It is a very elaborate Bill which will take a lot of interpretation, but to put the various provisions of this and the other Bills in place we need resources.  It is no use having legislation unless it is implemented.  While I welcome the Bill I appeal to the Government, if they are committed to the environment, to make the funds available to the various agencies so that they can implement the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and all concerned in the preparation of this very comprehensive Bill.  I will not be repetitive but <Col N="2359" /> I should like to deal with one specific aspect of the Bill, environmental protection, which has not been adequately dealt with.  I refer to the disposal of hazardous toxic waste, something which has concentrated the minds of the people in my own constituency for some time now.</P>
      <P>Members will have been aware of the highly organised demonstration which took place last week outside the gates of this House.  Representatives of dozens of groups from Donegal and Derry were there to express their deep concern about the proposed plans to build a toxic waste incinerator at the Du Pont plant in Derry of sufficient size to deal with all the waste of the Thirty-two Counties.  This plan has been fiercely opposed by virtually every responsible body in Derry and Donegal in spite of the assurances from Du Pont that the so-called state of the art equipment will render the whole process safe. This has certainly not been the experience elsewhere.  The environmental organisation, Greenpeace, have demonstrated that it has been impossible in Europe and in the United States to identify all the toxic emissions from an incinerator or the chemical residues in white ash.</P>
      <P>In Donegal, the Inishowen Peninsula, just across the river from Du Pont, is in the unfortunate position of being directly in the path of the prevailing south-westerly wind, downwind of the proposed site.  It is not surprising therefore that the people who live there are worried stiff about the implications for their health, not to mention the possible consequences for agriculture and tourism.  The Du Pont incinerator is estimated to cost £40 million sterling and it would appear that the plan depends on whether the Irish Government are prepared, in the words of Dr. Ian Madden, deputy director of Du Pont, to partly fund its construction and then to direct all toxic waste from the Republic to Derry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest part of this waste will be transported through substandard roads <Col N="2360" /> in Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan and the dangers from road accidents involving tankers and other containers travelling on those roads is obvious.  Du Pont recently announced that they are proceeding with an environmental impact assessment of the proposal.  However, it has also been stressd by Dr. Madden that our Government would not have a role in this assessment or in the running of the incinerator &mdash; in other words, we are invited to contribute our money but to give them <i>carte blanche</i> from then on. This proposal is quite intolerable.</P>
    <P>The sad part is that, as far as Donegal County Council and others are concerned, the perception is that the Minister for the Environment and those involved appear to have given the project their blessing, at least in principle, without consulting those people directly concerned. The Minister is reported to have said that Ireland could not support more than one such incinerator.  I wonder whether the Minister, or the Minister of State, or any Member of the House would readily support the siting of an incinerator in his or her constituency.  I very much doubt it.  Is there a feeling here that this is something that can be safely consigned out of harms way to that far-flung outpost named Donegal?  I can assure the House that Donegal people are not primitive tribesmen who can be pacified with multi-coloured beads.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the whole idea of providing a single toxic waste disposal unit for the entire country is unwise to say the least.  The siting of a national incinerator in Derry would serve to attract what we described as dirty industries to the northwest; we can certainly do with industries but not at the expense of human health and the destruction of tourism which is our single most likely vehicle for generating employment.</P>
    <P>I can find no specific reference in the Bill to toxic waste disposal apart from one line in section 60 which lists, among other things, co-disposal of industrial and other wastes in relation to those matters <Col N="2361" /> which involve the selection of landfill sites for waste disposal.  The words &ldquo;toxic waste&rdquo; are not included and I assume they are not meant to be dealt with in relation to landfill sites.  I strongly recommend therefore that the Minister seriously consider the acceptance of an amendment which would deal specifically with this matter and with the precise powers of the agency in relation to it.</P>
    <P>What we require here is not one incinerator but a list of all producers of toxic waste in the State, with details of the amount of waste involved and to what extent, if any, these producers are engaged in a programme of toxic waste reduction.  The ideal target would be zero production of toxic waste, but the only way we can hope to achieve that is to make each producer responsible under strictly enforced laws for the safe disposal of this type of waste.  To provide a national incinerator would be to discourage industrialists from making a genuine effort to eliminate the production of hazardous waste in the first place.  Are we being told that it is only possible to construct an incinerator which deals with 20,000 tonnes of waste, liquid and solid?  Is it not feasible to have a smaller plant for each factory or group of factories in a particular area?</P>
    <P>I am told that the greatest part of toxic waste production here is in Cork, Dublin and other centres in the southern part of Ireland.  I have a recurring nightmare in which I see tankers and trucks loaded with lethal material heading day and night towards Lough Foyle and I wonder how often they will overturn or crash on our narrow roads.  I am talking here of journeys of up to 300 miles or more on a regular basis in all types of weather.  I appeal to the Minister to give this matter serious consideration and, if possible, to propose the necessary amendment that I have requested.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7 September 1991, a copy of which I will gladly supply to the Minister.  An article written by <Col N="2362" /> Denis Coughlan outlines the concern expressed about the rapidly growing practice of producing round bale silage. He refers to it as the polythene pollution revolution.  According to Teagasc statistics, in the counties of Galway, Mayo, Roscommon and Clare 50,000 hectares of round bale silage will be produced this year.  That will mean that ten million sheets of polythene will be discarded in those four counties alone, and that figure, of course, would be multiplied if we take into consideration the other counties in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This type of silage making entails the wrapping of the grass or hay in bales covered with layers of ever-lasting plastic. The advantages are numerous and the process eliminates concern about weather conditions and haymaking and also reduces the possibility of silage effluent into rivers and other waterways. However, the presence of millions of sheets of plastic in fields and hedgerows on an ever-increasing basis is likely to be a cause of great concern.  It appears that the only way to deal with this problem is to ensure that all or most of the plastic is collected and hopefully recycled.  It would involve a great deal of organisation and probably further regulations to deal with what Mr. Coughlan referred to as the polythene pollution revolution.  I will be interested in the Minister's comments on those two matters.  I heartily congratulate the Minister and all those concerned with this very comprehensive Bill. I am sure it will be a total success when it is implemented properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with some aspects of the Bill in a broad sense.  As a number of Deputies have said, it has taken an immense amount of time to prepare this Bill which will have great effect on different societies here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much thought and reflection must be given to this matter.  As my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, said, it is essential that a line be drawn between environmental protection and industrial progress. <Col N="2363" /> People must be seen to get fair play.  At present the environmental lobby is very strong and articulate and portrays its views very well while industrialists are seen in a general sense as the bad guys of society.</P>
    <P>There is an underlying problem here of high unemployment.  Employment opportunities must not be missed but at the same time we must draw a line between the environment and industrial policy.  That has not been done adequately over the past few years and is something that the Environmental Protection Agency will have to take on board.  They will have to set out policies to protect the environment and industry will have to toe the line as far as the guidelines are concerned.  It is essential from an industrial point of view that the cowboys of these industries, those who do not take environmental protection seriously, are weeded out and made pay for their illegal actions.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency must be seen to be independent.  I am glad to note that they will be an independent agency but they must be seen to act independently.  They cannot be seen to be the arm of Government or of the environmental lobby.  The House too has a role to play in this matter.  It is to be hoped that we will not have to go to the Government in one or two years' time with cap in hand looking for more finance for the agency.  Sufficient moneys should be provided in the Estimates to allow the agency to carry out their very necessary and worthwhile work.  Unfortunately, we do not know how much finance will be made available by the Government for the agency but if they do not receive sufficient financial backing to do their job properly the whole exercise will be farcical.  At that stage the agency will not be taken seriously by organisations and individuals whom they have to keep in line.  Will the Minister outline specifically how the agency will be funded and the financial implications of this Bill?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2364" /> Various Deputies have referred to the fact that the environment is the greatest asset we can hand on to our children and grandchildren.  As it is the only thing we can hold on to it is up to us to protect it. A number of Deputies said that environmental education should be part of the educational system and we should educate people about the importance of the environment.  I know that is not the function of the agency but the agency could take it on board and in conjunction with the Department of Education they could initiate educational programmes.  It is very important that students in both primary and secondary schools are educated in how to look after the environment.  If this is a gradual process it will in the long term make the job of the agency a great deal easier in addition to improving the potential of this country.  We all know that we have thumped our chests to show how proud we are to have such a clean, green environment.  Over the past number of months we have seen instances where the beef industry, for example, have tried to portray an image of cleanliness and of our grass fed cattle.  This is a very important image for this country and it creates opportunities for jobs.  Unfortunately people took advantage of that and a great deal of damage has been done to that industry.  It is extremely important that we learn from the mistakes made and that we do not repeat them.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the excellent environmental department in Sligo Regional Technical College which is in my constituency.  As my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, has so kindly pointed out, they have done tremendous work in ground water research.  Research is necessary to bring us to the forefront in making environmental impact assessments.</P>
    <P>When legislation is being introduced in this House it reminds me that we are one of the best countries for producing legislation but we have great difficulty policing our laws.  This goes back to the matter of finance and it is important that <Col N="2365" /> the Environmental Protection Agency is given the financial commitment so that it can enforce the law.</P>
    <P>In my part of the country tourism is extremely important.  There are 50 lakes in a 15 mile radius and the water in our rivers and lakes is very clean.  However, over the past number of years a great many farmers have had to spend a great deal of money trying to rectify sources of pollution.  This has created some animosity towards tourism because the farming community were seen to be the bad guys.  They have been advised by the Department of Agriculture ten or 15 years ago to install a certain type of tank to take the silage slurry, but ten years down the line they were told that it was totally inadequate and that the effluent was a source of pollution to the rivers and lakes and they would have to spend large amounts of money to rectify this during a time of declining agricultural markets.  Unfortunately this puts farmers in a very difficult position.  It is important that this is cleared up in the not too distant future and that the Environmental Protection Agency are seen to act fairly to these people.</P>
    <P>The local authorities were charged with implementing the pollution Acts.  I recall reading that the pollution of Lough Sheelin, which fortunately in one sense is not in my constituency &mdash; and Deputy Cotter will know more about it than I &mdash; was thought to be caused by intensive farming in the area, and indeed that may be so in part, but a consultant carrying out an independent study found that the Ballyjamesduff sewerage scheme was one of the major contributors to pollution within Lough Sheelin.  It seems farcical that the Department of the Environment would be one of the major contributors to pollution and that due to a lack of finance it took them a number of years before they allocated adequate resources for a proper sewerage scheme in Ballyjamesduff in order to stop that source of pollution.  I have a list of areas in both Counties Sligo and Leitrim where this <Col N="2366" /> situation pertains.  In my own town of Ballinamore a great deal of money is being spent on the reopening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  We need financial assistance to provide a sewerage treatment plant because raw sewage flows into the canal at Ballinamore and that will not be a pretty site for any tourist who may wish to take a boat trip on the canal when the work is completed.  If one arm of the Department of the Environment are responsible for enacting this legislation and the lack of resources from another arm of the Department is causing pollution, the whole situation becomes farcical.  I recall that a year to 18 months ago the Minister for the Environment made a press statement in which he said £100 million &mdash; please correct me if I am wrong &mdash; would be spent on the environment on sewerage schemes etc. within the next five to ten years.  It is very important this money is spent quickly and correctly.  In Leitrim for example in Drumsna, Jamestown and Dromod which is along the Shannon and a high density tourist area, they are awaiting sewerage schemes for the last six years. The Cloonnacool sewerage scheme in Sligo is also important.  There is also the north Sligo regional water supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline what steps the Garda propose to take to deal with this very serious problem of vandalism and intimidation being experienced by the residents on the north side of the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been concerned for some considerable time about the policy of policing in Cork.  I should like to refer to a copy of the <i>Evening Echo</i> of Wednesday, 26th June 1985.  I expressed <Col N="2367" /> concern that the special Garda units operating out of the new headquarters in Mayfield and Gurranabraher were being disbanded.  I felt that that was a retrograde step.  The areas affected by that move were Gurranabraher, Farranree, Knocknaheeny, Churchfield, The Glen, Mayfield and Fairhill.  At that time I also indicated that the new districts would not help the gardaí to carry out their job in an efficient manner.</P>
    <P>I will give one example.  The district headquarters at Gurranabraher includes the Blarney and Ballincollig Garda stations. If the gardaí in Gurranabraher are unavailable for any reason, then gardaí from Ballincollig are called upon to assist.  Ballincollig station is eight miles from Gurranabraher and is on the south-west side of Cork city.</P>
    <P>An urgent review of the districts is necessary to give a better service to the community.  In my area of Farranree, for instance, three Garda stations cover a portion of the parish &mdash; the Watercourse Road, the Mallow Road and Gurranabraher.  This is a clear indication of the urgent need for reorganisation of the districts.</P>
    <P>A number of incidents have been reported in the press recently and people are very concerned at the increase in vandalism and the lack of Garda presence in the area.  Additional gardaí are needed to develop Community Watch and close liaison with the Garda.  I strongly urge the Minister to give consideration to the provision of additional gardaí to the Cork area.  Many new gardaí were passed out recently but, unfortunately, they appear to be going in one direction, and that is not in the direction of Cork.  By a reorganisation of the districts in Cork and the provision of additional manpower, the Minister would go a long way towards allaying the fears and anxieties of the community at large.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give me an assurance this evening in relation to community gardaí, Community Watch and community policing.  A haphazard approach is being taken in this area, <Col N="2368" /> in that gardaí who have been assigned to duties in Mayfield and Gurranabraher in particular have built up a good relationship with the community but then, all of a sudden, if there is a manpower shortage they are put out on ordinary duties.  That is a retrograde step which is destroying relationships which the gardaí concerned have built up in that community.  I strongly urge the Minister to give me an assurance in the Dáil this afternoon in relation to that matter.</P>
    <P>I raise this issue here this afternoon not as a criticism of the Garda, although it is a criticism of the administration.  That method can be improved.  We are calling for efficiency in health, education and the environment and we must call for efficiency in justice as well.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are fully aware of the problems to which Deputy Wallace refers.  I have the utmost sympathy with communities who have their everyday lives affected by this type of mindless and costly vandalism, and I thank Deputy Wallace for his consistent representation of this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are informed by the Garda authorities that vandalism has been a problem in Cork, particularly in the north part of the city.  Unfortunately, much of that vandalism has been directed at schools in the area.  The divisional Garda officer in Cork has drawn up a strategy to deal specifically with these problems.  All members have been directed to be fully alert to the possibility of vandalism at all times; additional patrols have been directed to the worst affected areas, including Mayfield and Gurranabraher, which are being patrolled on a 24-hour basis; vulnerable areas, including schools and shopping centres, are being targeted by the gardaí for specific anti-crime attention. In addition, as part of this strategy, as many gardaí as possible are being deployed on foot patrol.  In this respect the community policing scheme, which <Col N="2369" /> involves the assignment of individual gardaí to full-time foot patrols, has an important role to play.</P>
    <P>Community gardaí act as a link between their colleagues and community groups and have proved to be very successful in dealing with the type of case described by Deputy Wallace.  There are nine community gardaí in Cork city and an inspector and a sergeant have recently been given responsibility for the supervision and co-ordination of the activities of the community gardaí in the area.  As a result of the measures taken by the gardaí a number of youths have been dealt with under the juvenile liaison scheme and a youth has been dealt with by the courts in relation to damage to a school in Farranree.</P>
    <P>A particular aspect of this kind of problem is the involvement of young people who mindlessly destroy property that has been acquired by the hard work of decent people.  Their lack of respect and regard for the rights of others is something that must be addressed.  While instilling the right attitudes into young people is mainly the responsibility of parents and educationalists, the Garda authorities are very conscious of this problem and recently initiated a special schools' programme. The Garda schools' programme is designed to educate young people to have respect for the property of others. At the moment it is in operation only in selected schools in Dublin and Limerick, but I am glad to say it is proposed to introduce it to Cork as soon as possible. The Garda authorities have also recently reformed the juvenile liaison service, and a national office has been established to oversee its operation countrywide.</P>
    <P>Of course, the problem of juvenile crime is not confined to Cork and there is no doubt that the whole legal approach to young offenders needs to be updated. For that reason we intend to introduce next year a juvenile justice Bill to update the law in this respect.  In the meantime, the powers conferred on the Minister for Justice under the Children Act, 1908, <Col N="2370" /> have been invoked to bring in new rules of court, which will change the regime in regard to the attendance of the parents or guardians of offenders at juvenile hearings.</P>
    <P>Of course, community involvement is essential if vandalism is to be tackled effectively.  An alert and vigilant community that takes sensible precautions to protect their property and that keeps a watchful eye on the property of neighbours, can help greatly in dealing with this problem.  For that reason the gardaí in Cork are actively involved in giving crime prevention advice to the public and in promoting community involvement in crime prevention through Neighbourhood Watch.  There are now more than 30 Neighbourhood Watch schemes in Cork city alone.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Deputy Wallace and his colleagues that everything possible is being done to deal with the problem in Cork city to which he refers, that Garda authorities continue to monitor the situation and will take whatever future action may be necessary to tackle the problem.</P>

    <Col N="2371" />
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very limited time available to me I wish to raise this evening the sale of 141 acres of prime land at Clogheen, Cork, which borders the city and county.  The land was sold for £290,000, which works out at an average of £2,000 per acre.  The land was sold in five lots.  The sale of lot five &mdash; 1.6 acres &mdash; for £16,000 was sanctioned by a Southern Health Board meeting held in May 1988, and the proposals to sell lots one to four were rejected by a majority decision of the board at that meeting.</P>
      <P>Amazingly, the Southern Health Board members reversed that decision at their meeting the following month.  A major influence in this respect were reports from the county manager and a letter which indicated that the land in the county area was in a green belt zone. That statement was made despite the fact that the green belt concept had been broken on at least 40 occasions in that area and Cork County Council had sold a site just in excess of one acre for £31,000 in the same year and allowed a two-storey development there.  They were further influenced by a report of the valuation officer of the Department of Finance who valued the land at agricultural prices, even though the officer concerned had never visited Cork but based his judgement on information supplied by health board officers.</P>
      <P>The members of the Southern Health Board were also influenced very much by a report from auctioneers, Hamilton, Osborne and King which was seriously defective and inaccurate, and was, in my opinion, a misleading report.  I am most critical of the performance of those auctioneers in this episode.  The decision to sell the land at the basic agricultural price of £2,000 an acre was taken despite receipt of a letter from Mr. Tom Rice, City Manager, indicating that part of the land, which lay within the city, was suitable for low-density development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2372" /> If time allowed I would quote that letter.  More seriously, the health board meeting of May 1988 was not informed that there were higher tenders in for the 1.6 acres which went for £16,000.  I can now disclose that there were two other tenders, one for £36,000 and another for £26,000, both submitted on condition that outline planning permission would be received for the 1.6 acres.  These offers were rejected and the unconditional offer of £16,000 accepted.  Amazingly, the person who bought for £16,000 had obtained outline planning permission for the land before he had paid the Southern Health Board for it.  Since then he has received planning permission for 14 four-bedroomed simi-detached and detached houses at present being built at a cost of £65,000 per house.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Southern Health Board meeting of June 1988 &mdash; which had agreed to sell lot No. 4 of 21 acres for £49,000 &mdash; was not informed that higher bids had been received, one for £62,000. I have documentation to prove that the bidder was quite prepared to make an unconditional offer far in excess of the £49,000 eventually received by the Southern Health Board.  In fact the individual who got the land for £49,000 had originally bid £45,000 only and was allowed a second chance whereas the higher bidder was not afforded the same opportunity. That land now has outline planning permission for five detached bungalows which sites are going at a conservative estimate of £20,000 to £30,000 per acre. Also there is an outline planning applicatin lodged for a filling station on that land.</P>
    <P>There are serious irregularities and discrepancies in relation to the tendering processes involved.  There has been a total rip-off of a valuable public asset with a consequent loss to the taxpayer, to say the least, occasioned by grave mismanagement on the part of officials of the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available I can only summarise the whole episode by saying <Col N="2373" /> that the taxpayer has been the victim of a serious case of gross mismanagement and incompetence on the part of the management of the Southern Health Board; second, the taxpayer has been the victim of serious irregularities in the tendering process; and, third, the taxpayer is also a victim of the incompetence of the valuation officer of the Department of Finance who valued the land without ever visiting Cork.</P>
    <P>Serious questions have been raised about the involvement of a senior health board official in the land purchase transactions. Questions posed by me to the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board seeking an assurance to members that no health board official was involved were met with silence on two occasions.  Despite approaches to the Minister for Health, the Minister consented to the sale of the five lots in late September 1988 and the legal formalities for the transfer of the land were put in train.</P>
    <P>These lands are now in the ownership of private individuals with a consequent loss to the taxpayer.  Serious questions have been raised by this land transaction. I want the Minister to agree to the establishment of an independent inquiry to establish whether health board officials were involved in the land transactions; second, whether political influence was used to gain advantage in the land transactions, and, third, in order to judge the level of mismanagement involved.  Tragically, if a development plan was undertaken for this land I believe that, at a minimum, the price would have quadrupled. There has been a major loss to the taxpayer and serious issues raised which have not been answered.  I believe the Southern Health Board senior management at least were guilty of gross incompetence involving substantial loss to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to agree to an independent inquiry and to take immediate action to initiate steps to bring about the resignation of the senior officials of <Col N="2374" /> the Southern Health Board involved in this deal.  The Ministers for Health and Finance are the Ministers responsible for this appalling scandal.  I call on both Ministers to establish an independent inquiry into all the circumstances relating to this deal which stinks of incompetence and irregularities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>My departmental records show that the Southern Health Board acted properly at all times during the transaction concerned. A very reputable and professional firm of auctioneers was retained by the health board to deal with the sale. This firm made an advance assessment of the land before it was advertised and, in addition, consulted both planning authorities, Cork Corporation and Cork County Council, with regard to the potential for future development of the land.  The reports received from the planning authorities highlighted certain major problems with regard to infrastructural services, such as water supply, surface water and foul sewer drainage. The lands were zoned for agricultural or amenity use.  Both planning authorities ruled out any significant residential or commercial development in the area, a policy confirmed by the number of planning permissions refused in previous years for the same area.</P>
      <P>The farm was advertised for sale in five lots so as to maximise the opportunity of attracting as many potential purchasers as possible and advertisements were placed in the national and local newspapers. Sale was by tender and the prices achieved, following advertisement, in fact, exceeded the pre-advertisement valuation. The collective amount realised for the five lots was endorsed as being reasonable by the Valuation Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tenders came before the board for approval at their meeting of 2 May 1988. The board approved the sale of lot 5, a site of 1.62 acres, but did not approve lots 1 to 4 and instructed the chief executive officer to discuss with the city manager <Col N="2375" /> and the county manager how best to maximise the value of these lands.  Discussions were held with both parties. Both managers confirmed in writing that the existing water and drainage services, together with the zoning of the area for amenity or agricultural purposes, precluded the grant of planning permission for residential or industrial development of the land in question.</P>
    <P>The question of the sale of the land was raised again at the health board meeting of 7 June 1988 when board members voted to sell the four lots, the voting being 23 to 1; 24 to 1; 23 to 2 and 22 to 2, respectively.</P>
    <P>In the case of lot 4, some 21 acres, the highest tender submitted was subject to planning permission.  Since it had been made clear by the planning authorities that this would not be forthcoming the tender was not accepted.  One tender at £45,000, without conditions was received.</P>

The eventual prices obtained came to £306,500 for all five lots.</P>

      <P>The study to which I refer was undertaken by Dr. Áine Gallagher attached to the UCD Department of Public Health.  Indeed, the study has not yet been published, although I am aware that it will be published.  Dr. Gallagher gave details of the study in various medical publications and in the media last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we read in the papers last week were very disturbing facts.  Dr. Gallagher maintains there is evidence that the hit <Col N="2376" /> and miss approach to cervical screen testing throughout the country has resulted in many poorer, less advantaged women not being screened at all.  Those are the women most at risk.  The main claim she makes &mdash; and this is the most worrying point of all &mdash; is that almost half the women tested, whose tests proved positive between 1980 and 1985 &mdash; were not contacted to ascertain whether they were aware of the results of their tests nor were called for follow-up screening.</P>
    <P>If that is the case &mdash; and I am asking the Minister to give me information on this &mdash; this is, indeed, serious because some of these women who would not have been notified, who would not have been given the option of treatment, could have developed cervical cancer whereas a reasonably simple surgical process could have been carried out to ensure that they did not contract that disease.  This cancer is controllable.  It is the one disease which, if caught early enough, can be cured.  This is accepted beyond doubt and in countries such as Finland and Norway it has been stamped out altogether through good, well-structured and properly funded programmes.  We are far from that stage here.  Irish women are still the poor relations in preventative health care.  There is, for instance, no cervical screening service in the health centres in Cavan, Monaghan or Cork and Kerry.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister in his reply will lay great stress on the fact that St. Luke's cytology department now process results in 24 hours.  That is a big improvement and it is to be acknowledged but it does not go far enough.  There is a critical need for realistic reform.  Action must be taken on the alleged 40 per cent of cases where women were not properly notified or given follow-up treatment.  The Minister might say what he intends to do in this regard.  There should be greater regional promotion of a screening service.  Every health centre should advise women and carry out this service, making special efforts to reach the at risk over-45 age <Col N="2377" /> group.  There must be a centralised register of positive tests and an efficient follow-up system should be initiated.  The woman's name and last address should be noted.</P>
    <P>Women deserve a properly-funded service. All women over the age of 35 should have three-yearly screening wherever they live.  It should not be a disparate service which is patchy in rural areas and good in Dublin.  They should be informed of the result, whether negative or positive, and get treatment if necessary.  Lives can be saved with better organisation. We could have no deaths from cervical cancer here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure every Member would share the concern of Deputy Fennell that there should be a highly efficient cervical screening service available to women. The report to which Deputy Fennell referred, which has not yet been published, refers to the period 1980-85 before I became Minister.  In the years 1985 and 1986 complaints were received about the availability of testing and delays.  In general it was felt that the service was poorly organised and under resourced.  The delay in testing arose because of the shortage of resources in the laboratory services.  Additional resources were provided for these laboratories and the backlogs were subsequently cleared.  The problems concerning availability of tests were resolved.  St. Luke's were able to state in a recent press release that there is a 24-hour return service on tests submitted to them.</P>
      <P>Women, regardless of income, can arrange through their local health centre for the test to be taken or they can attend their family doctor or the local outpatient department.  The service is also available in family planning centres.  Testing kits are provided free of charge by St. Luke's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dr. Gallagher's report which relates to the years 1980-85 the age profile of <Col N="2378" /> those availing of the service was considered disproportionate in that a high number of those below the age of 25 were taking the test.  The study also highlights the quality and the timing of the notification of the results to referring doctors and patients and poor history taking by referring doctors.  When I came into office in 1988 I established a committee to review the whole service and the committee has produced a very constructive interim report.  Its major recommendations are being considered for implementation.  The main recommendations are the provision of improved training of staff, reporting time to doctors and patients not to exceed one month &mdash; which is the position &mdash; abnormal results to be followed up quickly by the referring doctor with the laboratory assistants, common classification to be adopted, continued availability of the service through different outlets and the computerisation of laboratory procedures.</P>
    <P>Recently, in accordance with an undertaking in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, I arranged for the reconvening of that committee chaired by the chief medical officer in my Department to look at the operational efficiency of the test notification procedures which are <i>inter alia</i> the subject of Dr. Gallagher's study.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I am fully committed to an effective, comprehensive service and if there are areas which need to be addressed we will see to it.</P>

      <P>The regulation of investment advisers is urgently required.  The <Col N="2379" /> recent collapse of a number of investment firms and the subsequent major financial loss to clients highlights a substantial gap in the regulation of the investment services sector.  The Government are effectively putting an individual's life savings at risk by not taking immediate action.</P>
      <P>Any investment intermediary selling non-insurance products, such as unit trusts, is not obliged to satisfy any requirements in respect of the handling of client funds, the provision of bonds or the issue of appropriate documentation to clients.  It is not acceptable that individuals should be exposed in this way.</P>
      <P>Consumers investing in life assurance products through insurance intermediaries have a reasonable level of protection following the enactment of the Insurance Act, 1989.  It is vital that equivalent protection is given to consumers investing through investment advisers in non-insurance investment products. While I recognise that legislation is complex, it is important that any legislation introduced is both practical and cost-effective and will be of real benefit to consumers.</P>
      <P>I understand that an inter-departmental committee have been discussing this matter for the most of 1991.  I am disappointed that no proposals have emanated from that committee to date.</P>
      <P>At present any investment adviser involved in the sale of life assurance products must observe certain conditions.  It is logical then to suggest that a similar regulatory regime should be introduced for non-insurance packaged investment products.  This would give equality of competitive conditions for competing investment products and would also make compliance by investment advisers involved in selling both insurance and non-insurance investment products much simpler.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has indicated his intention of producing proposals to protect the consumer with the provision <Col N="2380" /> of new regulatory guidelines in respect of investment products.</P>
    <P>Consumers are grossly unprotected at the moment and this should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is concerned that we do not yet have adequate controls in respect of certain investment activities, and the Minister is anxious that the gaps in our present regulatory system be closed so as to avoid the problems associated with the failure of investment intermediaries.</P>
      <P>The insurance-related activities of investment intermediaries are governed by the 1989 Insurance Act, the operation of which is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The non-insurance areas of investment activity are not, however, currently subject to regulation. The principal activities that come under this heading are investment in UCITS and Unit Trusts.  The Minister for Finance considers it appropriate that persons and firms providing an investment service to the public should be licensed and should have to satisfy supervisory requirements in respect of all their investment activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulation in this area is closely bound up with the draft European Community Investment Services Directive which will set out the parameters for national legislation. However, adoption of the Directive has been delayed by the complexity of the issues involved and the question of introducing supervisory arrangements here in advance of the adoption of the Directive is now being considered.  The investment sector is a complex one and discussions have been taking place with the different interests involved.  The Minister for Finance hopes that it will be possible to announce progress on arrangements for supervision of the investment intermediaries without delay. He has already announced that legislation is being prepared to change and <Col N="2381" /> update the regulation and supervision of the Irish Stock Exchange.  The intention is that the Exchange will be subject to the Central Bank as regulatory authority.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would urge people to think carefully before they entrust part of their life savings to investment operations which hold out the prospect of spectacular returns.  Investors should be careful to check out the status and credentials of any investment firm whose services they wish to avail of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise with the Minister the high cost of certain goods and services in Ireland compared to our EC partners.  I realise that the Minister for Finance has responsibility only for the element of prices which is relevant to taxation.</P>
      <P>Our rate of VAT is the second highest in the EC, with only one country having a higher rate at 22 per cent.  The cost of our telephone service is the highest in the EC by a wide margin.  The cost of travel in Ireland is also the highest in the EC by a wide margin.  The price of motor cars here is the tenth highest in the EC. It is interesting to note that only Portugal and Greece are more expensive than Ireland in that category.  The reason cars are so expensive here is that VAT and excise duties push the price way up.  It is also interesting to note that car sales this year have collapsed.  Many garages are in extreme difficulties and are finding it difficult to remain open.</P>
      <P>A further interesting statistic is that consumption of goods and services in Ireland is higher only than in Portugal and Greece.  Obviously this would suggest that disposable income is extremely limited in Ireland.  Allied to all this we have the highest unemployment rate in the EC.  I suggest that all these matters are interconnected.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's proposals for bringing these matters under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general comment I would point out, of <Col N="2382" /> course, that there are many goods and services which are, at present, priced competitively here <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of Europe.  Energy is a case in point.  Of course, there are many factors at play in relation to how the price of any good or service is constituted.  Tax, for which the Minister for Finance is responsible, is only one of them.  Apart from tax, different prices may prevail in different markets for a variety of reasons such as consumer preference, access costs, marketing practices or distribution costs. Very detailed analysis would be required to separate out how these various components of retail price interact with one another as between one member state and the next.  Such analysis would not be a function of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>In so far as our relatively high tax rates impact on prices here, the Deputy must look at the wider perspective.  Tax rates are not pitched at high levels because of any whim of Government or the Minister for Finance.  Rather they reflect the economic and budgetary pressures that are brought to bear by factors such as unemployment, the extent of State borrowings and the level of public expenditure.  High levels of debt and excessive public spending during the last decade meant that tax levels were, in many cases, pushed to intolerably high levels.  Resolute action since 1987 has restored order to the public finances, and, at the same time, real benefits have been conferred on consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking specifically at taxes on spending, good progress has been made in reducing the standard rate of VAT which applies to the bulk of consumer goods and services.  We no longer have the highest standard rate in the Community and there is now only a three-and-a-half percentage points gap between Ireland and the UK, compared to ten points only two years ago.  Our levels of excise duties have been held static generally and indeed, in the case of televisions, videos, camcorders and records, either abolished <Col N="2383" /> of reduced.  This combination of measures has been welcomed by consumers and traders alike and has considerably reduced the tax-based incentive to shop outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The advent of 1992 will, of course, bring further advantages.  As tax borders <Col N="2384" /> disappear there could well be pressures to further reduce indirect tax rates differentials and, as rates of VAT and excise duties in the Community converge, consumers should experience still greater benefits through price competition.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 1 November 1991.</P>

The relevant periods in the case of An Fórsa compare very favourably with what is required for members of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      <P>As I undertook in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 17 of the 19 June last, I have had this matter examined further and I am satisfied that the present arrangements have full regard to the special nature of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and afford due recognition and reward to its members for long and dedicated years of service.</P>

      <P>As part of the internal management of the Defence Forces a study group of military officers were appointed in September, 1990, for the purpose of examining the peacetime establishment.  The study group have met on 34 occasions and their deliberations are still in progress.</P>
      <P>In addition, a number of subsidiary boards have been established in the three principal military branches of my Department, viz, the branches of the chief of staff, the adjutant-general and the quartermaster general.  These boards have been engaged in analysis of work in these branches which has a bearing on the work of the study group.  The study will be completed in 1992 when a final report will be presented.  An interim report is expected within the next month.  The views of unit commanders were requested and over 100 units were visited &mdash; all Permanent Defence Force units and a sample of FCA units.  For security reasons it would be inappropriate to publish the report of the study group.</P>

      <P>During the course of Garda investigations a serving soldier was suspected of leaking restricted information.  The military authorities established that the soldier concerned was a private with six years' service and that he was attached to the Signal Corps.  He was arrested on 22 August 1991 and brought to Raheny garda station.  The leaked information included data of a transient character on certain military operations to which he had access due to the nature of his employment in the Signal Corps.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to his release from Garda custody the soldier was interviewed by the military police and he made a further statement to them.  He was paraded by his commanding officer on the 30 August 1991 and informed that it was proposed to terminate his service.  He was given seven days to appeal or offer information in his defence.  He declined and was discharged on 21 September 1991.  I understand that the Garda inquiries in this case are proceeding.</P>
      <P>A detailed investigation has been set up by the Chief of Staff into the circumstances of this case and all aspects of security will be reviewed so as to ensure, as far as possible, that there should be no recurrence of a breach of security such as occurred in this instance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice of the Defence Forces for many years to carry out training exercises as part of contingency planning for tasks they might be required to perform.  The exercise referred to in Deputy Spring's question enabled the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service to participate in joint operations in pursuance of such planning.</P>
      <P>Similar exercises have been held at other locations e.g. Blasket Islands, Aran Islands, Bere Island, off Kinsale and Dublin Bay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2298" /> For reasons of security it would not be appropriate to disclose details regarding training exercises by the Army Ranger Wing.</P>

      <P>Until recently there was no provision for medical examinations of FCA recruits on enlistment although there was a requirement for personnel to undergo a medical examination when reporting for annual <Col N="2307" /> training.  It is now considered preferable from an administrative point of view to have a medical examination on enlistment as the previous system of medical examinations on reporting for annual training had placed a considerable strain on the resources of the Army Medical Corps.</P>
      <P>The revised arrangements have been in operation since 1 September 1991. Similar procedures have been operated in the Slua Muirí for a number of years.</P>
      <P>Medical examinations are carried out by members of the Army Medical Corps or by doctors employed by the Department where Army Medical Corps personnel are not available.</P>
      <P>Any delays which may have arisen because of the revised arrangements have now been eliminated and no FCA unit, irrespective of its location, should be at a disadvantage in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 69 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>I agree generally with the recommendations of the inquiry into the Ballycotton tragedy on the appropriate role for the Central Fisheries Board.  In this regard I would advise the Deputy that under section 8 (1) (a) (i) of the Fisheries Act, 1980 it is a function of the Central Fisheries Board to co-ordinate, and if necessary, direct the performance by the regional fisheries boards of the functions assigned to them under the Act.</P>
      <P>In some areas such as training, purchase of certain boats and so on the Central Fisheries Board have always played some role and they are now stepping up this role in the light of the recommendations of the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the training of fisheries boards' staff and the purchase of equipment I wish to advise that the Central Fisheries Board earlier this year engaged the services of an expert from the Robert <Col N="2311" /> Gordon Institute of Technology &mdash; RGIT &mdash; Scotland, to review the operations of the fisheries boards, primarily in relation to safety, and to assist in the co-ordination of training and the purchase of equipment.  As a result, a considerable amount of progress has been made in putting the operations of the various boards on a safer footing and in ensuring that their staffs are adequately trained and properly equipped to carry out the tasks expected of them.</P>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board are, of course, always available to the regional fisheries boards to offer advice and assistance on a large number of issues.</P>
    <P>If we turn to the question of the appointment of an additional executive head to staff in each board area, the desirability of such posts has been recognised for many years but it was not possible due to general financial and staffing constraints to secure approval for the creation and filling of the posts.  I am pursuing as a matter of high priority all possibilities for the approval of the posts concerned at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggested amendment of section 8 (1) (e) (i) of the Fisheries Act, 1980, I have noted the views of the inquiry.  As I understand it, the aim the inquiry had in mind was that the central board would be required by law to provide training services.  Such a formulation would, I believe, be highly unusual in legislation of this type.  The key aim should in my view be to ensure that the Central Fisheries Board give due priority to the provision of training services and especially so in so far as safety matters are concerned.  I will be pursuing this matter on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>Copies of the draft rules were forwarded to all the interested groups for their observations and of those who have forwarded observations none have made any comment in relation to the number of meetings to be held.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the fact that the Ballycotton Tribunal Inquiry has stated that coastal radio stations and coastal garda stations should be equipped with VHF radios and other such forms of radio equipment so as to enable them to not alone pick up distress calls but to communicate these to the relevant rescue agencies, he will outline the progress which has been made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a maritime VHF network is on-going since 1982.  There are now 11 VHF remotely controlled stations positioned around the coast, seven of which have been developed since my Department were set up in March 1987. Valentia coast radio station, County Kerry, is the control centre for Rosslare, Minehead, Cork, Bantry, Valentia and Shannon stations while Malin Head coast radio station, County Donegal, controls Dublin, Malin, Glenhead, Belmullet and Clifden stations as illustrated on the map which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two coast radio stations, which are manned on a 24 hour basis, are equipped to transmit and receive on both VHF and <Col N="2313" /> MF equipment.  VHF equipment extends some 50 miles out to sea while MF equipment has a much longer range &mdash; 150 miles approximately.</P>
    <P>In the event of a distress signal being heard the manned station at either Valentia, or Malin Head, will alert any other ships in the vicinity of the casualty and notify the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Shannon whose job it is to initiate the appropriate SAR response from shore.  MRCC has at its disposal a number of rescue units for SAR operation from a variety of organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2314" /> Given that there is now a newly established national 24 hour VHF coastal radio network, with a specific function to monitor VHF emergency channels, I do not believe that equipping coastal Garda stations with VHF marine band or such other forms of radio equipment would provide any additional benefit bearing in mind that not all coastal Garda stations are manned on a 24 hour basis, and taking into consideration the other duties they have to perform.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to regular part time employees covered by <Col N="2320" /> the Workers Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991.  This Act extends to regular part time employees, on a modified basis, with effect from 6 April 1991, the benefits of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, which governs both annual leave and public holiday entitlements.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, a regular part time employee is an employee who has been in the continuous service of the same employer for not less than 13 weeks, is normally expected to work at least eight hours per week and who prior to the enactment of the 1991 Act was excluded by the operation of thresholds from a range of protective legislation.</P>
      <P>In relation to annual leave, the Act of 1991 provides entitlement for a regular part time employee to six hours' paid leave for every 100 hours worked and to proportionately less where fewer hours are worked.</P>
      <P>Where a regular part time employee has eight or more months' service, he/she is entitled to an unbroken period of annual leave equivalent to (i) the leave entitlement earned over the first eight months of service or of the appropriate leave year or (ii) two thirds of the total leave entitlement earned in the first year of service or in the appropriate leave year.  The entitlement to an unbroken period of annual leave is subject to the terms of any registered employment agreement, employment regulation order or agreement with the employee's trade union.</P>
      <P>In relation to public holidays the Act of 1991 extends to regular part time employees entitlement to the eight public holidays provided under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  The 1973 Act provides that in respect of each public holiday, an employee is entitled to: a paid day off on that day, or a paid day off within a month, or an extra day's annual leave or an extra day's pay, as the employer may decide.</P>

      <P>Ireland has always been consistently active at EC level in the area of nuclear safety and we have continued to press for the acceptance of internationally recognised minimum safety standards by all nuclear power countries because of the transboundary implications of nuclear accidents.  We have long called for an inspection force within the European Community which would be independent of national authorities and would examine all safety aspects of the nuclear industry.</P>
      <P>At the Energy Council meeting during the Irish Presidency in 1990 I ensured that the Council was fully informed of Ireland's views on nuclear safety and related issues.  At that meeting Ireland expressed its continued opposition to reprocessing at the Sellafield plant and requested that discharges into the environment should cease through closure of the plant.  I have also ensured that every opportunity was taken by other Ministers, by officials of my Department and officials of other Departments to raise our strongest objections on this matter at EC and other appropriate meetings.</P>
      <P>In response to Irish and other pressures, the Commission announced last year a reintroduction, after a 20 year gap, of inspection of radiation monitoring facilities under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty.  While this does not go as far as we would wish, it is nevertheless a step in the right direction so far as Ireland's policy in this area is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall continue to press for an inspection force to examine all aspects of the nuclear industry in the EC and I shall continue to seek the closure of Sellafield. As recently as Tuesday last at the EC <Col N="2322" /> Energy Council I placed our insistence on the required inspectorate before the Community's Energy Ministers and stated that I would continue to do so until Ireland got a satisfactory response to our legitimate concerns.</P>

      <P>As I have already announced, the small claims <Col N="2327" /> procedure is to be introduced on a pilot basis in four locations.  The procedure will provide a quick, informal and inexpensive means of resolving consumer disputes where the amount involved does not exceed £500.</P>
      <P>I set up a committee to organise and oversee the implementation of the pilot scheme.  The committee have looked at various aspects of the operation of small claims fora elsewhere and have made considerable progress in setting up the arrangements for the new procedure. The President of the District Court and the Director of Consumer Affairs have also been actively involved in the process of deciding upon the detail of the new procedure and how it should be implemented.  Work on the preparation of District Court Rules to give effect to the procedure is at an advanced stage.</P>

The Garda Síochána are notified of deaths while on duty or in barracks which do not appear to be due to natural causes. In such cases a military policy and/or Garda investigation is carried out.</P>
      <P>Where the death is due to injury while on duty a military court of inquiry is held.  The findings of courts of inquiry are submitted to the relevant military authorities for such action as they consider necessary.</P>

      <P>The report of the Gleeson Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces clearly underlined the desirability of examining the whole question of the deployment of the Defence Forces.  It is in this context that a rationalisation of FCA units is being considered.  Examination of the matter is proceeding and there will be no decision in relation to the number of staff to be retained at any particular location until this examination has been completed. Forty officers of the Permanent Defence Force who had been employed with the FCA on a part-time basis were withdrawn from such duties with effect from 1 September 1991.</P>

      <P>A quantity of some 6,000 .303 Lee Enfield rifles, which were surplus to requirements, was disposed of by sale to a Canadian company in early 1991 following competitive tendering.  While it is not the practice to disclose details regarding the prices realised for such sales the overall revenue generated by the sale of the rifles, including a small quantity of other weapons, was £270,000 approximately.</P>
      <P>The question of the disposal of further obsolete weapons is being kept under review.</P>

      <Quest>if he has any proposals to increase the fines for those operating without a haulage licence on the roads under the Road Transport Act 1986; if he will make such fines mandatory as arising out of a number of recent convictions they are very low; and if he will make a full statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am having a review carried out at present in my Department of the adequacy of existing legislation in the area of road haulage.  The level of fines for the offence of operating without a haulage licence is being examined in that context.  The existing maximum fine of £1,000 on summary conviction is a not inconsiderable penalty, but as the Deputy has pointed out the actual fines imposed by the courts in a number of recent cases have been very low.  The question of providing for mandatory fines will be considered in the context of the review.</P>
