      <P>On a point of order, in view of the fact that Question Time is ten minutes late starting, for reasons I do not understand, could we have the agreement of the House that Question Time be extended by ten minutes to ensure that no fewer questions are taken than would have been the case if the Government had arrived at 2.30 p.m.?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government established the Second Commission on the Status of Women, we gave them comprehensive terms of reference to ensure that the commission could respond to all issues of concern to women and their role in society.  It would not be appropriate <Col N="1362" /> for the Government to circumscribe the commission's independence by asking them to focus on a specific issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the proposed reform of family planning legislation requires a great deal more than just changing the age minimum of persons to whom condoms can legally be sold?  Would he accept that legislation in this area affects to a large extent the health and well being of women?  Would he not accept that it seems a little ridiculous to have a Commission for the Status of Women, to which 600 submissions have been made, when the Government then ignore whatever recommendations are made to that commission?  Does this mean that in 18 months' time when the commission report we will be coming in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The commission have terms of reference which enable them to carry out a complete, comprehensive review of the status of women and to discuss and examine any matters of interest to them.  It would be wrong and <Col N="1363" /> inappropriate for the Government to specifically direct them to look at any particular issue.  The Deputy said something in her reply about the Government ignoring the recommendations of the commission.  That is completely misleading.</P>

      <P>The Government agree with this view, which is in accordance <Col N="1364" /> with the Presidency conclusions of the meeting of the European Council in Dublin on 25-26 June 1990.</P>
      <P>I might add, in relation to the series of questions tabled by the Deputy on matters arising in the Intergovernmental Conferences, that the Government believe there should be a wide-ranging national debate on these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that, in current circumstances, the best way to get this debate under way is to commence with a debate in this House and I shall ask the Government Chief Whip to discuss arrangements to this end with the other party whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach expect that a referendum will be necessary here in regard to the outcome of the conferences?  Will he indicate whether the referendum which will be required here will need to be held before the end of 1992?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of the Community is fully on record in that regard.  The Community expects that the changes in the Treaties will be formulated and ratified by the member states before the end of 1992.  I have already, on a number of occasions, indicated it is almost certain that a referendum will be required in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that that timetable will be met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason to believe that it will not be met.  In all the discussions at Community level, when these matters were being debated, there was a widespread insistence that this timetable should be adhered to.  The timetable was laid down very early on <Col N="1365" /> and there is general agreement among the member states in the IGCs that these two Intergovernmental Conferences should complete their work so that everything can be in place and ratified by the member states by the end of 1992.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of having a debate in this House, does the Taoiseach expect that it will take place during this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so, yes.  That is what I have in mind.  As I have already said in the House, it is a question of judgement.  The IGCs are still very much at a formative stage and it is a question of when our debate could be most useful and fruitful.  On the one hand it might be better to wait a little while until something more concrete emerges from the IGCs for us to focus on in our debate but, on the other hand, perhaps it is necessary that, increasingly, the general public should turn their attention to this matter.  Perhaps the best way of doing that is to have a comprehensive debate here fairly soon; the latter would be the best option.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach that we will be having a debate in this House.  In advance of the debate, will the Taoiseach say whether the Government will take the opportunity to publish a White Paper or a position paper in relation to this country's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Intergovernmental Conferences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have already indicated that that would not be a satisfactory or appropriate exercise at this stage.  I think we might just have the usual type of debate, an introductory statement from the Government side outlining the position as they see it and inviting the views of the House on the issues before the two IGCs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of this very <Col N="1366" /> important debate, will the Taoiseach consider the possibility of allowing multiple interventions in the House where people could ask the Government questions and have them answered instead of the present system of a series of monologues where there is no meeting of minds because of the procedures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so, that course would not recommend itself to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's statement that the Government will not publish a position paper in advance of the debate, would it be possible for him to break with normal procedure and to circulate his contribution &mdash; or that of whoever will be speaking on behalf of the Government &mdash; some days before the debate to the spokespersons in the Opposition parties so that at least the contributions from this side of the House would relate in a real sense to what the Government are saying on the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not involved at this stage but, as the Deputy knows, we are already in receipt of Community funds either directly in these areas or in related areas.  It is a matter which would have to develop but the first thing is to decide what is to be the competence of the Community in these areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>How could the competence of the Community be extended in these areas if there is no financial commitment to back it up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, there are many areas in which the Community already has competence, and exercises competence very rigorously, and which do not have any financial implications or contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it would be very wrong if the Community were to be involved in passing judgement, for example, on the educational system or the health services in member states if the Community was not, at the same time, prepared to make <Col N="1368" /> some contribution towards the cost of those sevices in member states like Ireland which have a high dependency ratio and, therefore, a higher requirement to spend on health and education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is really the issue.  The Community exercises competence in many areas at present.  For instance, it has taken unto itself competence in industrial relations matters by the Social Charter and there are many areas, such as energy, where the Community does exercise competence without any financial implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand how the Government can say, through the Taoiseach today, that they are in favour of the Community extending competence to health and education and yet at the same time not be able to make up their minds that they are also in favour of the consequence, which is, that the Community should have financial means to support health and education.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying one or the other.  What I am saying is that it is quite possible for the Community to exercise competence and lay down principles and regulations in any area without necessarily incurring any financial implications by doing that.  There are already <Col N="1369" /> a whole range of areas in which the Community does exercise a competence without putting up any funds for any particular purpose.  In the two areas mentioned by the Deputy, health and education, it is quite possible to visualise the Community exercising a competence by laying down standards of one kind or another in regard to equality of opportunity and so on without necessarily incurring any financial obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The other side of that coin is that this Government are frequently accused by their opponents of having a begging bowl attitude only to the Community.  I see us as contributing both ways, participating in the formulation of Community policies and, where those policies benefit us, reaping those benefits.  It is a very wide area but I think in particular in regard to economic and monetary union, IGCs and that development, our concentration should be on ensuring that the Community has adequate policies for economic and social cohesion.  That is what we must try to insist on emerging from both political union and economic and monetary union IGCs.  That is where we in this country <Col N="1370" /> on the periphery of Europe, stand to gain most.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I set out my views on the concept of Community citizenship in my report to the House on 1 November 1990 on the Special Meeting of the European Council in Rome on 27-28 October 1990.  I said that I welcomed the proposal to see, covered in the amended Treaty, the question of citizens' rights and also that, in general, we should support an evolution of the concept of Community citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with these views, the Government have, in the intergovernmental conference taken a positive view on the conclusion in the Treaty of appropriately framed provisions for a Community <Col N="1371" /> ombudsman and for equality of treatment. It is, however, too early to judge whether there will be agreement to include such provisions in the Treaty or how these would operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is very hard to conceive of the idea of equality of citizenship between somebody who has their education given to them in a class of 35 and somebody else in another part of Europe who has their education given to them in a class of 20?  Would the Taoiseach, therefore, not agree that it makes sense that the Community, if it believes in the concept of equality of citizenship and opportunity, should be prepared to contribute towards the cost of education in member states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if any such principle would find very wide acceptance at this stage but, as I said to the Deputy's colleague, I think that our efforts in this regard and in all these areas should be directed at having adequate and comprehensive policies for economic and social cohesion with suitable back-up mechanisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I urge the Taoiseach to be somewhat more ambitious in his vision of what Europe can achieve than he seems to be in the reply he has just given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>This idea of Community citizenship was put forward by Spain in the first instance and from the time this concept was enunciated we have been full supporters of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there is a danger that this attitude that some countries hold, that we as a country approach Europe with the begging bowl, can put this country at an unfair disadvantage in so far as that what is not being said is that the Irish taxpayers pay a considerable amount of money educating people who are the greatest asset in most European countries <Col N="1372" /> in the creation of wealth within those countries?  Would the Taoiseach agree that in our efforts to bring our standards up these countries have an obligation to support us in terms of education and other services?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an argument which most of us have used from time to time but it might not be one which would find general acceptance in the Community.  I reiterate that in both political union and economic and monetary union, particularly in economic and monetary union, what we must try to achieve is positive active policies in the Community designed to ensure economic and social cohesion, designed to ensure, by specific action if necessary that the benefits of economic and monetary union are distributed equally throughout the Community particularly the peripheral regions, and that there should be positive mechanisms to ensure that those policies are implemented and achieve results.  How far the principle of economic and social cohesion stretches is another matter. Whether it would stretch into areas like education or not still has to be decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to economic and social cohesion which is obviously extremely important to this country, surely the Taoiseach is aware that the Commission is denying that there is a real link between EMU and regional imbalances? Does he accept this view from the Commission or have we an alternative view?  Are we trying to put forward an alternative view because of the importance to this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We put forward very positive views already to the EMU IGC setting out how we believe economic and social cohesion should be implemented in the economic and monetary union.  I dealt with this in Killarney last Saturday at some length.</P>

      <P>I was thinking of faxing a copy, but I could not remember your fax number.  The Commission has actually given two different views on this matter.  On one occasion they gave the view that there is no doubt EMU would bring an overall considerable increase in the economic prosperity of the Community but that there was no <i>a priori</i> reason for thinking that that would be distributed evenly throughout the Community. Later on they gave another view which says that they were convinced that the peripheral regions would definitely gain most out of economic and monetary union.</P>

      <P>I already indicated to Deputy Barry that we are prepared to consider some extension of the functions of the joint committee.  That would, perhaps, be the best way to approach it. With regard to a common approach by these committees around Europe, I see enormous difficulties.  The Parliaments in member states in many cases operate on a different basis to us.  As the Deputy is probably aware, in Denmark, for instance, they have a particular committee system of their own.  It would be difficult to establish any sort of homogeneity between the different committees but we are certainly not averse to looking at the possibility of extending the role and functions of the joint committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The President of South Africa, Mr. F.W. De Klerk, accompanied by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Leon Wessels, paid a one-day working visit to Ireland on Thursday last and had discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and me.  Our discussions continued over a working lunch.</P>
      <P>The talks covered political and economic developments in South Africa and included the issues of political prisoners and exiles and of violence in the townships and elsewhere, as well as South Africa's position in southern Africa generally and its relations with Ireland and the European Community.  I greatly welcomed the opportunity which the visit provided to exchange views with President De Klerk and to receive from him a detailed outline of his programme for the establishment of a pluralist democracy in South Africa and the problems and difficulties in the way.</P>
      <P>The President outlined in great detail his plans and the irreversible process under way to bring apartheid to an end. I emphasised to him the Irish Government's long-standing opposition to the system and our firm wish to see it abolished at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The visit of President De Klerk provided an important opportunity to indicate the Government's firm support and encouragement for the reforms being pressed forward by him and our desire that the process would continue with all possible speed.  The visit also enabled me to express our expectation that, as the reforms continued, they would influence relations between South Africa and the international community, including Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate what evidence President De <Col N="1386" /> Klerk provided that the reforms under way are, in fact, irreversible?  The Taoiseach will be aware that the representatives of the community in South Africa who have consistently opposed apartheid have indicated that they do not want sanctions removed until there is evidence of irreversible reforms and that they expressed concern that that evidence does not yet exist.  Would the Taoiseach outline what proposals he made to President De Klerk as, according to a report of his speech in the National Concert hall, he indicated, that he, the Taoiseach, and Deputy Collins, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, had made tremendously constructive proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions primarily took the form of President De Klerk providing information for us and outlining his plans for dealing with progress towards a pluralist democracy.  The Deputy knows as well as I all the things that are adduced in favour of the argument that the process called apartheid is irreversible and President De Klerk assured us firmly that his programme is to move steadily towards a pluralist democracy.  The two principal pieces of legislation are now being brought forward and he gave us an assurance that they will be enacted during the lifetime of this particular Government.  He also spoke at great length about his efforts to meet the wishes of the ANC with regard to political prisoners, exiles and violence in the townships.  All in all, the meeting took the form of an informative outline by President De Klerk of his plans and the progress he is making.  He was also at some pains to outline the difficulties that the whole process, not just he as President, is encountering in South Africa.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that the question of sanctions was not discussed. President De Klerk did not make any request to us with regard to sanctions. Naturally, he wishes to have improved relations with this country and with the European Community in particular.  Our attitude to that was that we foresaw a process taking place whereby as the situation in South Africa developed satisfactorily and moved towards a pluralist society and the final and total abolition of apartheid <i>pari passu</i> with that relationships with this country and the European Community would improve equally. Questions like removing the rest of the sanctions, establishing better trade links, removing the ban on sporting contacts and the possible ultimate establishment of diplomatic relationships will all be part of the process but, as I said, it would be a <i>pari passu</i> process.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to accept &mdash; although I take the Taoiseach's word for it &mdash; that at a meeting between the Taoiseach and the President of South Africa sanctions were not discussed in some way.  President De Klerk may not have referred to them but may I ask the Taoiseach if he referred to them and to outline the proposals which President De Klerk claims the Taoiseach made to him? May I also ask the Taoiseach in what way will the question of the easing of sanctions be approached?  Is it intended to have a programme to ease the sanctions related to specific improvements in the position of the black and coloured population in South Africa?  The Taoiseach referred to the expectation that two pieces of legislation will be enacted soon.  Will they lead to an easing of sanctions and, if so, will the actual implementation of these acts be a requirement before sanctions are eased because, as we all know, legislation can be put on the Statute Book but often it is more difficult to implement such legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, it is a multi-faceted and very complex situation. Let me deal with the last point first.  With regard to these two pieces of legislation which deal with what are known as the pillars of apartheid the President did indicate that it is his intention to have them enacted within the lifetime of the present parliament.  As I said, I am <Col N="1390" /> sure most people would have expected the South African President to make an appeal to us on sanctions but strange as it may seem he did not.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned it is up to ourselves to decide on what action we should take on sanctions.  As the Deputy knows, the position is that we move in harmony with our European partners who have already decided to remove the ban on investment. The removal of the sanctions on iron and steel and Krugerrands is being held up by the Danish Parliament but the decision has been taken to remove those. Thereafter perhaps the matters of major interest so far as we are concerned would be our own two specific items.  It is a matter for us to decide as we wish on the merits of the situation.  The Community was influenced in removing the sanctions by the need to give a signal of support to President De Klerk.  After all, the international community cannot have it both ways.  If they approve of what President De Klerk is trying to do, and if they believe that he is sincere in what he is trying to do, it is not unreasonable that they should offer him some assistance and some indication of support in what he is trying to do.  We must always keep that in mind in looking at the question of sanctions.  That will be our attitude, too.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on all the circumstances surrounding the taking from situ and smuggling out of Ireland for sale of a number of early Christian gravestones and other antiquities; the action the Government have taken for the return of these items; and if he will outline the action under way to stop the traffic in archaeological and heritage items out of this country.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The removal of ancient Christian sculptured gravestones from the monastic site of Inchcleraun in Lough Ree are matters which are under current investigation by the Garda Síochána in co-operation with police and customs <Col N="1391" /> authorities in the USA.  The slabs in question are now in official custody in the United States and criminal charges have been instituted there.  These items constitute important evidence in the pending case and they will be returned to Ireland when the necessary legal processes are complete.  Under these circumstances, it would not be appropriate to comment further on the details of this matter.</P>
      <P>It is a clear and specific objective of Government policy with the full support and commitment of the management and staff of the National Museum, the Office of Public Works and the Garda Síochána to stamp out the illicit trade in Irish archaeological objects.  The House will be pleased to know that since 1981 over 2,000 archaeological and antiquarian objects have been safely recovered domestically and internationally by the National Museum and important sculptures from Clonmacnoise and Inish Cealtra have been recovered by the Office of Public Works.  A notable recent example about which I informed the House on 18 December 1990 was the recovery of an important Bronz Age lunula put up for sale in London.</P>
      <P>The present case is an instance of decisive action by the Irish institutions in following up all such cases and I congratulate them.  I wish to pay a particular tribute to the law enforcement agencies in the USA on the outcome of their investigations which were conducted in a spirit of close co-operation with our museum and police authorities from the outset.  I also wish to thank the authorities of Boston college who, when offered the material, immediately contacted the National Museum of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preservation of our unique archaeological heritage is a matter of great national importance.  The export, or sale for export, of archaeological objects is unlawful under the terms of the National Monuments Act, 1930, as amended in 1987.  Further legislative proposals to confirm the State's rights in the matter of our archaeological heritage are at an advanced stage of preparation and will be brought forward as soon as possible. <Col N="1392" /> I avail of this opportunity to appeal for vigilance by the general public in every part of the country in assisting the authorities in their efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the situation is out of control when he states that 2,000 articles have been recovered in the last number of years, which are probably only the tip of the iceberg?  That could mean that 5,000 or 10,000 articles could have been stolen or taken away.  Surely the law is not strong enough under the National Monuments Acts or the Historic Monuments Acts to stop this kind of traffic.  One newspaper reports that this haul was valued at £3.5 million or £3.7 million.  That gives an idea of the gravity of the criminal activity in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not really a matter of the law; there is no great problem about the law in the matter.  It is a question of administrative action by the museum and by the Garda Síochána, and that is what has been effective over the last few years &mdash; drawing attention of international institutions to the existence of this trade, seeking their co-operation in defeating it and, in particular, following up everything we come across and know about.  I think most important of all &mdash; this is where all Deputies in the House can be of assistance &mdash; unless we have an alert public opinion in every part of the country to help us in this task we will not totally succeed, but if the people in the local communities are alert and aware of anything that is happening and notify the museum authorities, that will be followed up immediately by the authorities and by the Garda Síochána.  There is no particular impediment in their way because of lack of legal capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this case there was a suggestion that NORAID were involved in creaming off some of the profits that were made on this deal. Maybe the Taoiseach would like to make a statement on any information he has to hand in relation to the involvement of <Col N="1393" /> subversives or organisations close to subversives in these matters.</P>

Is there any danger that this would be affected by the provisions of the European Internal Market which requires freedom of exports and imports, particularly in view of the fact that he already agreed today in response to Question No. 3 to the suggestion that the EC's competence be extended to the area of heritage and cultural affairs?</P>

However, on this occasion it was difficult for the ESB to ensure power for emergency services as the necessary switching is normally carried out by ETU members.  As Deputies will be aware, the ETU were supported by members of other unions refusing to pass ETU pickets, thus effectively taking strike <Col N="1399" /> action without giving strike notice.  Running a modern electricity grid is a very sophisticated operation.  The required skills allied to specific experience of ESB systems are only available among ESB staff and with the large number on strike it was only possible to maintain the minimum supply of power necessary to avoid a total shutdown.</P>
    <P>As well as examining the need for change in the industrial relations arena, it will also be necessary to consider whether complementary measures are available to minimise our vulnerability to power cuts in the event that a dispute proceeds to the strike stage.</P>
    <P>While it is likely that an electricity interconnector would have alleviated the situation, interconnection alone cannot guarantee continuity of supplies in the event of a dispute.  Interconnection has been an active policy of this Government; I have facilitated discussions already underway between the ESB and the National Grid Company in the UK.  The House can be assured that in the Government's wide-ranging examination of arrangements to minimise our vulnerability to electricity strikes, no option will be ruled out, including a review of ESB's monopoly situation.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the public and the parties in this House were not just appalled at the devastating effect of the strike but also at the apparent helplessness of the Minister in the face of that strike?  Had the Minister any prior warning from the ESB?  Did he intervene?  Has the Minister, at any time during the dispute or since, had a meeting with the chairman, the chief executive and the unions in relation to the problems which emerged last week?</P>

      <P>There was no explicit warning issued to the Government, to me as Minister for Energy or to the Minister for Labour, about the gravity of the pending situation and the development of such an extensive and devastating strike.  It is exactly because of that situation that the major review is now being carried out. <Col N="1400" /> The Minister for Labour has had meetings with the employers' federation this morning.  He is meeting with the ICTU on Thursday and had a meeting with the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission yesterday.  The primary objective of these discussions is to initiate proposals for putting together a code of practice for industrial relations.  I have had discussions with the chief executive of the ESB.  The Government considered the matter this morning and will be taking whatever steps are deemed necessary to ensure that in future this country is not held to ransom as it was during the past week.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to elaborate on what he has said.  During the 14-day period of strike notice, was he contacted by the ESB or did he attempt to contact them?  Would the Minister agree that the action that was subsequently taken by the Minister for Labour should have been taken before the strike occurred?  Would the Minister agree that he had an obligation and duty to take some action in the period before the strike took place?</P>

      <P>There were notifications and discussions between all the relevant authorities, including my Department. As I said last week in reply to questions, the unions had options open to them which they could have explored further and it was not anticipated that the dispute would have such widespread support within the group of unions in the ESB. The industrial relations machinery that existed within the ESB failed this test and failed to indicate the extent of feeling and the measures that would be taken by the staff.  That is most regrettable and the Government are anxious to ensure that these matters are attended to immediately by establishing quickly a new code of practice agreeable to all to ensure that this type of situation is not allowed to arise again.</P>

Can the Minister explain how he was unaware of this and why he was not made aware of it by senior executives in the organisation?  It came out of the blue.  This indicates that some people at the highest level are not doing their job properly.  The Minister indicated that we would not be held to ransom again.  How does he propose to ensure this?</P>

      <P>It is a very important issue.  The other questions in my name will have to be left over to another occasion.  Has the Minister considered making available to management sufficient trained personnel, whether former employees or other skilled people, who would at least be able to guarantee a minimum service because I do not believe the Government can be seen to do their job unless they can give the public that minimum guarantee?</P>

      <P>All the lessons of the recent strike have been dearly learned. With the benefit of hindsight the Government, Opposition and others will be a lot wiser.  I doubt whether I could give a guarantee that this would not recur.  May I say we are seeking to put in place codes of practice and procedures, hopefully, which will ensure that such circumstances do not recur, but nobody, not even I as Minister, can give that type of guarantee.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Bord Gáis Éireann as a commercial body are statutorily bound to earn a satisfactory return on their investments.</P>
      <P>The board are harmonising pricing policy throughout the group to ensure consistency in their dealings with all customers. They have assured me that their pricing policy is designed to ensure that gas remains competitive with alternative fuels.</P>
      <P>I understand that the gas supply contracts for a number of industrial customers came up for renewal this year and that agreement has been reached in the majority of cases.  In fact, within the last few days I was able to announce price reductions ranging from 7 per cent to 28 per cent for industrial customers with effect from 1 April last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty:</NameTxt>
      <P>The indications reaching me would appear to indicate that there has been enormous resistance to the steep increases in prices to industry. Is the Minister satisfied that industry can cope with such increases without their having substantial negative environmental and employment effects?  Would he say whether there is any justification for the view that Bord Gáis Éireann are being used as a source of Government revenue with prices being pitched at a level just about as high as they can be, that there is no transparency in those prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the pricing policy is to maintain gas prices to industrial consumers at a level competitive with alternative fuels; that is the policy.  I understand that Bord Gáis Éireann, as far as possible, are endeavouring to move all of their heavy fuel oil price-related customers to a common fuel oil base in the interests of consistency and fairness.  This development reflects a similar practice in the European market and the more widespread use of low sulphur fuels for environmental considerations.  In addition, the cost of imported gas, when it comes onstream, will reflect low sulphur oil prices.  Many of the contracts <Col N="1403" /> now being negotiated will remain effective when imported gas comes onstream. Therefore, we must take account of the fuel cost to the board.  Indeed, I might add that the present low level of oil prices means that in many instances customers will now be paying about the same for gas, on a 1 per cent heavy fuel oil market price, as they had been paying at a 3.5 per cent heavy fuel oil related price previously. Therefore, the Deputy will see that the environmental considerations are primary in the policy of Bord Gáis Éireann.  That is why the oil-gas relationship is being transferred from heavy fuel oil, 3.5 per cent sulphur to 1 per cent, for environmental considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister denying that that change in the linkage of the particular oil product has resulted in 10 per cent to 25 per cent increases for some companies?  Is it not a fact that the Government have put a budgetary figure on Bord Gáis Éireann that they are to contribute to the Exchequer and that they are extracting from industry every bit they think industry can possibly contribute and a bit more besides?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Competition Bill, 1991, represents a central instrument in this Government's programme to revitalise the economy, to encourage growth and thereby address the most pressing problem facing us all &mdash; unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will bring about a fundamental change in the basic structure of the market place by introducing into it a statutorily protected requirement for competition. Competition is fundamental to a growing economy.  It is the life blood of an efficient market &mdash; a dynamic regulator without which everyone suffers. When competition is present, resources are allocated efficiently, innovation and enterprise prosper, and consumer welfare is safeguarded.  Without competition firms may become dominant and bleed the economy.  Without competition cosy cartels can emerge and share markets to the detriment of consumers and suppliers alike.  Without competition a dominant market player can abuse his position to <Col N="1490" /> prevent new players entering the market place or to undermine successful companies. Without competition stagnation can infect a firm, an industry and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The objective of this Bill is to ensure that we have a properly competitive economy.  I am convinced that this can be achieved by constantly exposing all Irish firms to the stimulus of competition. Without such a stimulus I believe that our economy will continue to under-perform, that we will be doomed to the economic periphery of Europe and that unemployment will remain endemic.</P>
    <P>Competition is required throughout the economy in production and in distribution, in manufacturing and in services. All firms act as both suppliers and consumers in different market places.  If a firm has to pay too high a price for its professional services or its raw materials due to some cosy arrangement up the line, then the goods and services that it produces will carry unnecessary costs. Such additional costs can and do cascade through an economy making domestic products uncompetitive.</P>
    <P>The aim of this legislation is to address this problem at the core and prevent these additional costs infecting our economy and reducing our competitiveness.  By addressing this fundamental weakness in our economy I am convinced that Irish firms will increase their international competitiveness and not only withstand the pressures of the Single Market but prosper within it.</P>
    <P>Competition rules of the type provided for in this Bill are a characteristic of dynamic prosperous economies.  It is by no accident that economies such as those of the USA and Germany are so successful. They recognise the importance of the market as the machine for economic growth and the need to protect it by ensuring it is well oiled by competition. The two key items of legislation in the United States to protect competition are the Sherman and the Clayton Acts which were enacted 101 and 77 years ago, respectively.  This legislation and this policy have withstood the test of time and their impact is reflected today in the <Col N="1491" /> extraordinarily prolonged strength of the US economy.</P>
    <P>The beneficial impact of competition has been recognised from the outset in the European Community also and market protection mechanisms are incorporated in the Treaty of Rome through Articles 85 and 86.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the impact of failure to protect the market place can be seen throughout the world where it has led to stagnation and exploitation.  The free market economies of certain South American countries have shown the long term damage of such failure where the basic fabric of their societies has been eroded and significant comparative advantages dissipated.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to the introduction of legislation to give effect in domestic law to provisions similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome after the Fair Trade Commission presented a report to Government.  This Bill delivers on that commitment.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a significant part of the effort being made by the Government to prepare Irish companies for the increased competition which will follow on the completion of the Internal Market in 1992.</P>
    <P>The rules contained in Articles 85 and 86 already apply to those sectors of the economy which are engaged in trade at Community level.  There is no reason any sector should be sheltered from the discipline which these competition rules create.  It is interesting to note that those sectors of the economy which have been exposed to competition are the most dynamic and have made a real contribution to economic growth.</P>
    <P>The argument in favour of competition is not an academic one but rather is founded in the need to see the greatest possible degree of sustainable economic growth alongside consumer welfare. These twin aims are complementary.  It is possible to artificially stimulate economic growth but this always imposes a cost either directly on the consumer through <Col N="1492" /> loss of welfare or indirectly through the tax system.</P>
    <P>In its study of competition law, published at the same time as this Bill, the Fair Trade Commission in discussing the specific benefits which might be expected to flow to Ireland from introducing a more active competition policy stated, in Chapter 3:</P>
    <P>Much of domestic activity may have been insulated from competition up to now.  This is the case in particular with services.  The development of full competition in most sectors within the EC is very likely.  By acting quickly to bring about competition at domestic level, it is possible that Irish enterprises will improve their prospects of survival and development in the future;</P>
    <P>Because so much of economic activity has not been subject to competition law, it might be expected that the benefits of changing the law will be very significant in the early years and will give a substantial boost to the economy;</P>
    <P>The stimulus, and the experience of competition in the domestic market should better equip Irish enterprises and, particularly, Irish management to participate actively in world markets. One of the features of the successful exporting economies, Japan and Germany, is the intense competition in their home markets.</P>
    <P>I agree with this assessment of the commission.</P>
    <P>The only ones who should fear competition are the inefficient and those who conspire to deprive the consumer of the benefits to which he is entitled.  I hold no brief for either of these groups and I trust that no one else in the House does.</P>
    <P>It is of significance that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> recognises that &ldquo;a modern efficient market economy requires a satisfactory legal framework in the area of... competition policy&rdquo;.  Specifically, the programme points out that the application of the same competition rules as already apply to those engaged in trade at Community level, will stimulate competition in the <Col N="1493" /> remaining sectors of the economy, so that the traded sectors will not have to bear the costs imposed by anti-competitive practices in more sheltered local businesses.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation is based on the concept of what is called a control of abuse system.  It does not ban any particular activity until it has been investigated. Such investigations have been undertaken on a sector by sector basis and have led to the making of restrictive practices orders for particular sectors.  However, large areas of the economy have never been subject to investigation much less to action.  This type of fragmented and piecemeal approach needs to be radically changed.  Anti-competitive practices and agreements and abuse of dominant positions that operate in domestic business activity need to be outlawed as they are at community level under the Treaty of Rome.  In order to provide a comprehensive, but not confusing, system the former Acts and orders are being replaced.</P>
    <P>I will not detail here the numerous and time consuming steps that are usually involved in taking action against anti-competitive practices under existing legislation.  I have done so in this House on a number of occasions in the past and Deputies, no doubt, will be familiar with them at this stage.  It is clear that the difficulties and delays are considerable.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission have made clear their support for the application of the principles of Articles 85 and 86 to domestic business.  However, the commission's report took an approach to administration and implementation that was very closely based on the European Community model.  While the philosophy behind Articles 85 and 86 is fully acceptable to me I consider that administration need not follow the Community model but should be adapted to our own circumstances. Indeed given the differences between the role assigned to the European Commission under the Treaties and to various organs by our Constitution, it would be impossible to replicate the Treaty system exactly.</P>
    <P>Given that the central idea of the Bill <Col N="1494" /> is drawn from the Treaty of Rome, I cannot describe what is proposed as totally novel.  Indeed, a number of proposals have been introduced in this House which had the same objective as this Bill.  In the preparation of the Bill I have examined these earlier proposals.  There is a necessity in legislating to ensure that any new system works and I have tried to take account of the comments made about earlier ideas.  To the extent that there is novelty in the Bill it relates to its approach to administration and implementation.  This can be seen as the detail of the Bill is examined.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill, comprising sections 4 to 9, is the heart of the Bill.  Section 4, in line with Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome, prohibits and makes void anti-competitive agreements, arrangements and practices.  A list of examples is given that includes price fixing, sharing markets and price discrimination.  This list is not exhaustive.  The section allows exemptions from this prohibition to be given by the competition Authority.  Exemptions can only be given if the benefits of the agreement outweigh the negative effects of the anti-competitive elements in it.  An essential feature is that consumers must have a fair share of the resulting benefit. In no circumstances can an exemption be given if it would allow the possibility of the elimination of competition in respect of a substantial part of the products or services in question.</P>
    <P>Section 5, which is based on Article 86 of the Treaty, prohibits the abuse of a dominant position in trade in the State or a substantial part of it.  Unlike section 4, there is no possibility of an exemption being granted against this prohibition. The Bill will not allow, under any circumstances, the abuse of a dominant position.  I think I need to say something in detail here about what is meant by a dominant position.  I am prompted to do so by what I have seen, particularly in recent times, of over casual and careless use of the term.  The term &ldquo;dominant&rdquo; has been used by people to describe the position of companies that are not dominant but at that moment are disliked by the speaker or writer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1495" />&ldquo;Dominant position&rdquo; is not defined in the Treaty of Rome and no definition is offered in this Bill.  It is not possible, in advance, to set precise criteria such as percentage market share that would allow dominant positions to be defined for all markets.  Very few markets are so static as to allow that sort of analysis. Although not defined in the Treaty the concept is clear.</P>
    <P>In a number of cases the European Court of Justice has addressed this issue and defined a dominant position as an economic strength enjoyed by an undertaking which enables it to prevent effective competition being maintained in the relevant market by giving it the power to behave, to an appreciable extent, independently of its competitors, customers and ultimately of its consumers.  This description clearly brings out the point that it is the issue of relationships within a market that are central to determining whether there is dominance.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want it to be clear that it is the abuse of a dominant position, and not the existence of such a position that is prohibited here.  A dominant position can exist so long as it is not abused.  Behaviour in the market is the issue being addressed. It is quite clear from this that there is no conflict between competition policy as expressed in the Bill and the industrial policy which the Government continue to promote.</P>
    <P>The enforcement mechanisms proposed in the Bill are designed to ensure effective action without imposing undue burdens in compliance or enforcement. The system will be transparent and objective. Section 6 allows any person who suffers loss in consequence of a breach of sections 4 or 5 a right to damages or an injunction to restrain further damage.  It offers an advantage over existing arrangements because it gives a direct remedy to those aggrieved and does not require action by any official authority.</P>
    <P>The competition Authority, which is dealt with in Part III of, and in the Schedule to the Bill, will decide whether exemptions in respect of restrictive <Col N="1496" /> agreements should be granted.  The procedures to be followed are set out in sections 7 and 8.  In order to ensure transparency these sections provide that decisions on applications for exemptions made by the Authority will be published. Their decisions will be open to review by the High Court as provided in section 9.</P>
    <P>Actions for enforcement, whether initiated by private individuals under section 6 or by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will be decided on by the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 10 establishes a new competition authority, whose principal functions I have already outlined.  The Fair Trade Commission will be abolished. Section 11 allows the Authority to carry out studies at the Minister's request. Section 12 requires the Authority to report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce each year and that he publish these reports.</P>
    <P>The concept of control of monopolies, with mechanical and artificial criteria for determining when they exist, as provided in the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, will be replaced by a ban on the abuse of a dominant position.  Section 14 sets out how this will be done if there is a fundamental structural problem arising.  This provision is supplementary to Part II, which concentrates on behaviour, and I expect it to be used only in the gravest of cases, if at all.  The corresponding provisions of the 1978 Act were never used.</P>
    <P>The introduction of these clear concepts and simple mechanisms will make much of our previous restrictive practices legislation redundant.  These Acts and Orders can be repealed.  This is provided for in section 22.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also amend some of the provisions of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978. Experience with its operation, particularly in recent years, has demonstrated the need for certain changes.  These changes are principally in the area of timing of notifications, the supply of information to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and enforceability.  Sections 15 and 16 deal with these points.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> The criteria against which a merger is to be assessed by the competition Authority are set out in a clearer fashion in section 17 than was the case in the Schedule to the 1978 Act.  A change will also be made in respect of publication.  Under the 1978 Act reports of the Fair Trade Commission on merger cases have not been published.  Reports on such cases by the competition Authority will be published, but confidential business information will not be discolsed.  This will ensure that assessment of significant merger proposals is carried out in a transparent way.</P>
    <P>The 1978 Act will be amended, by section 19, to take account of the EC Regulation on the Control of Concentrations. This Regulation, No. 4064/89, which has been in force since 21 September 1990 gives the EC Commission exclusive jurisdiction, with some rare exceptions, over very large crossborder mergers in the Community.</P>
    <P>Parts I and V of the Bill contain standard provisions in relation to citation, commencement, repeals, expenses and deal with authorised officers.  The Schedule, as I mentioned earlier, sets out the detail of the competition Authority's composition, rules and powers.</P>
    <P>To the extent that there has been public comment on the Bill since its publication, such comments have very largely been positive.  I welcome this response and I have no doubt that it will be reflected in contributions to the debate here.  I hope that a positive response will speed the passage of the legislation which I hope, with everyone's co-operation, to be completed by the summer.</P>
    <P>The question may be posed whether this Bill will solve all competition problems. The temptation is to claim excessive credit and answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but that is unrealistic.  The truth is that it will never be possible to deal with all competition problems to the satisfaction of everyone. However, this Bill so improves the present unsatisfactory system that I have no hesitation in promoting it.  Its coverage should be universal as far as principles are concerned.  The Bill is relatively short and sets out as clearly as possible how <Col N="1498" /> the essential objective of introducing a modern concept of competition rules is being proposed.  I will consider any proposals for refinement of the system envisaged in the Bill but its thrust and the essential principles it contains should not be altered.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>We welcome any Bill that improves competition and benefits industry, jobs and the consumer.  As regards the publication of Bills on two occasions in the last fortnight I have seen references in the newspapers which resulted, presumably, from press releases from the Minister's Department about proposed legislation, including this Bill and the one that was published last Friday.  I received a copy of this Bill two days after I read about it in the papers &mdash; I see Deputy Rabbitte nodding in agreement.  I presume it was for the benefit of the conference on Saturday that the Minister published the two Bills at this time. Opposition Deputies did not receive copies of the Bills until after members of the press had received them.  I would have thought that Deputies were entitled to receive them at least at the same time as the media &mdash; in fact before the media.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has talked about his intention to introduce a Competition Bill for some time, both in office and before coming to office.  As he said in his speech, it is part of the Programme for Government set out by his party and the Fianna Fáil Party.  He has finally produced the Bill which we are now discussing. Given the length of time it has taken to produce the Bill I would have expected something better than what is essentially a scissors and paste job.  The Bill which has been eventually produced is an unhappy combination of existing legislation from both national and European sources.  It extracts two Articles from the Treaty of Rome namely, Articles 85 and 86, and a number of sections from the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and combines them &mdash; although the Minister has said the entire article is not <Col N="1501" /> included in either case &mdash; into what I think is a potentially disastrous cocktail for Irish business and consequently for the consumers.</P>
      <P>What was expected from the Minister was a detailed and comprehensive approach to competition.  The need to legislate in this area is an important step towards preparing Irish industry for the challenge of the single market which is now just 18 months away.  Unfortunately, the pressure of party political considerations and the conference that was held in Cork over the weekend have influenced the timing of this Bill more than it should.  What should have influenced the Minister is the interests of the Irish business community and of course the Irish consumers.  Some sectors of industry have already indicated their disappointment with the lack of consultation in this area.  While it is true that, as the Minister says, there is an initial welcome in the industry for a competition Bill, I have spoken to a number of trade associations and professional institutions since the Bill was published, and indeed I have been approached by others, all of whom have complained that neither the Minister nor his Department made any effort to elicit their views before the legislation was drafted.  The result is a Bill that does more for the legal profession than for Irish industry or indeed for the Irish consumers. I have spoken to trade associations, auditors and accountants' associations and solicitors, none of whom has been asked to give their views on this very important legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make clear the Fine Gael position in this area.  Fine Gael favour a market-orientated economy.  We wish to see the promotion of a competitive philisophy. I have no argument with what the Minister set out in the first and second pages of his script in that regard.  I fully subscribe to it, but I do not think this Bill fulfils what is set out.  Such a philosophy would be of benefit to the consumers, business enterprises, employees and the economy generally.  Interference with market forces should be minimal, be it State interference or indeed interference <Col N="1502" /> by various interest groups such as businesses collaborating with one another to negate market forces or indeed groups of businesses or trade unions who are able to exploit their positions of power.</P>
    <P>That would lead me to talk about what happened last week in the ESB and the abuse of their position of power by one of the trade unions involved in that dispute. I am not one of those people who rush in to say that because one such instance occurs the monopoly position of the ESB should be dismantled, but this whole question must be looked at in a calmer atmosphere than that which prevailed last week.  We should try to ensure that industry and consequently consumers and jobs are protected from the actions of a very small minority of people who abuse their position, and if that means dismantling the ESB and dividing its generation and distribution into two different companies, that must be considered. In the light of this legislation and whatever assurances can be given about supplies in the future we might find a ready response but in a calmer atmosphere than that which prevails at the moment.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael support in principle the concept of this Competition Bill and, as I have said, subscribe very strongly to the tone of the Minister's speech and to what he has set out in the first two pages.  From some of his speeches it appears that he thinks that business people in all industries are engaged in a huge conspiracy to abuse their position of power, to rob the consumer and provide them with bad value and inferior goods.  I have more experience of the business community than many people in this House and 95 per cent of them are honest and want to conduct their business in a way that will benefit themselves, their employees and the consumers.  However as in the case of Dáil Members, solicitors, doctors and people in other sectors of the community, 5 per cent do not behave in an honourable way.  The business community, by and large, are just as honest as any other sector of society even though sometimes the tone used in this House &mdash; and outside it &mdash; gives the impression that all business <Col N="1503" /> people are conspiring to break the law for their own benefit.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael support the concept of a Competition Bill which would promote competition and eliminate factors that interfere with market forces.  For this reason Fine Gael supported and called for the introduction of a competition practice which would ensure the operation of an effective, efficient and, above all, vigilant marketplace.  We will not be refusing a Second Reading of the Bill but, as I was told that the Minister was receptive to amendments when the Companies Bill was before the House, I hope he will table amendments on Committee Stage which will vastly improve this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as I said, is a disappointing and inadequate response to the need for an active competition policy.  The Minister missed a great opportunity but, more worrying still, he succeeded in creating unease and uncertainty in relation to the contents of the Bill and in the manner he introduced it.  I am sure the officials in his Department will convey to him the concern expressed to them, since the Bill was published, about many matters in it.  Indeed, there was a letter from the Minister in this morning's newspapers correcting what he perceived was a wrong interpretation of the Bill.  Even in the short space of time since the Bill was published someone eminently qualified to understand it was not correct in his interpretation of it, according to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The fact that it has taken the Minister so long to get a Competition Bill through the Government suggests that the Coalition relationship is a bit more strained than we are led to believe and that the winning streak about which we were told last Saturday night is not the reality because it is becoming increasingly clear that the Progressive Democrats are becoming powerless to influence legislation, given how long this has taken.  The Bill merely plagiarises existing legislation but, in so doing, it shows no appreciation of the way business works or of the environment in which it must operate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> The Bill suggests that little or no thought has been given to the impact it will have on the vast majority of business people who are trying to operate in a difficult climate.  Far from promoting competition, the Bill, is potentially creating a layer of regulatory networks to be negotiated by businesses.  However, business in this country is far too regulated and we are facing into a period of significant changes internationally including the progress towards the completion of the Single European Market, the concluding stages of a round of the GATT negotiations, the changing relationships within eastern Europe and between European states, which all bring uncertainty for business and, consequently, for employment.  This Bill is adding to that uncertainty.</P>
    <P>The Bill lacks clarity in its objectives and content and there is a great deal of uncertainty about its operation.  While the Minister was struggling to get it through Cabinet he could have used the time by publishing a White Paper on competition policy which would have allowed everybody to have their say in regard to this legislation.  However, he did not do this in the intervening two years.  He could then have initiated responses and submissions before finally formulating a Bill, which would have had widespread support from the people who will be working within its guidelines.</P>
    <P>The Minister should use this opportunity to introduce a Bill covering competition, restrictive practices, mergers, monopolies and takeovers, as well as consumer protection.  By lifting two Articles from the Treaty of Rome and incorporating them in the Bill the Minister seems to have forgotten that Articles 85 and 86 are only part of the Treaty and that there are other treaties by which they are governed which are set in the context of the Treaties of Rome.  In isolation &mdash; as they are here &mdash; many questions arise with which I will deal later.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that its objective is to prohibit the prevention, restriction and distortion of competition and the abuse of a dominant position in trade within the State.  It does not tell us to what end all <Col N="1505" /> this is being done.  The Bill's Long Title tells us very little.  Is it to promote, as the Treaty of Rome states, the free movement of goods and services within Ireland?  If so, we would applaud it.  Is it to make markets more efficient and to avoid the waste of resources inherent in inefficient markets?  Again, if that is the objective, we would applaud it.  What is the Minister's view of the aims of the Bill with regard to promotion of competition? Perhaps if we were made aware of his analysis of the needs in this area, we might be better able to interpret the practical application of the Bill.  As it is, it is simply more expensive bureaucracy for the business people who will have to operate it and, eventually, for the consumer.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the position of the Bill in regard to agriculture?  It is not clear whether it applies to agriculture because the Treaty of Rome does not. Does it apply to public and statutory bodies and to the public sector generally? They are not listed as being excluded, therefore, we must assume it applies to them.  If it is to apply to the public sector there needs to be a complete overhaul of many anti-competitive practices in that sector including the ESB, what was CIE &mdash; in its three constituent parts, particularly Dublin Bus &mdash; Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis Éireann.  Will all these bodies be included in the Bill?  If so, under section 14 (6) they may already be breaking the spirit if not the letter of the Bill because, presumably, they will apply for one of the licences.  If it will not apply to the public sector it will once again make private sector enterprises the whipping boy by subjecting them to different rules from those which apply to agencies, bodies and authorities which are associated with the Government.</P>
    <P>There is an omission in this Bill which is in the Treaties of Rome; under Articles 85 and 86 there must be an abuse of a dominant position.  I will read an explanation from a book called <i>EEC Competition Policy in the Single Market.</i> Page 21 lists the elements necessary for application of Article 86 as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> (c)  There must be an abuse of the dominant position, in the sense that advantage is taken of the dominant position which causes injury to third parties.</P>
    <P>Examples are:</P>
    <P>(i)  charging unfair purchase or selling prices.  Prices which are unfairly high will be to the detriment of consumers, while those which are unfairly low (below cost) may be aimed at eliminating weaker competitors, who do not have the power to match such prices for any length of time.</P>
    <P>That is not in the Bill before the House. Does the Minister intend that it should be because the EC Treaty, which the Minister says is necessary to open up markets and should be applied inside Ireland, sees that as being an abuse of a dominant position; yet it appears from this Bill that the Minister does not.</P>
    <P>The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>(ii)  discriminatory prices, e.g. charging customer A more than customer B for exactly the same transaction, thereby placing customer A at a competitive disadvantage;</P>
    <P>(iii)  refusal to sell to a customer without valid, objective reasons;</P>
    <P>(iv)  attempts to hold on to customers, for example, by granting fidelity rebates;</P>
    <P>(v)  acquisitions of competing undertakings, thereby affecting the competitive structure within the common market.</P>
    <P>That has happened in this country before when people attained a dominant position. An example of that in the last few months was where one meat company attempted to buy another, giving it a dominant position.  That certainly would appear to be prohibited under the EC Regulations.  Whether it is prohibited under this or not is not quite clear yet.</P>
    <P>Does the Bill apply to tendering procedures operated by the public sector or <Col N="1507" /> collusive tendering by firms seeking business in the public sector?  That is important. Does the Bill apply to these engaged in dumping products, that is, selling at a lower cost?  That is a similar point to one I read out.  If there is below cost selling it falls outside the definition of being engaged in trade for gain.  Is this Bill meant to deal with the dumping of goods from outside the State?  If not, are we still subject to the EC anti-dumping regulation which, as we know from experience, takes so long to operate effectively.</P>
    <P>Is this Bill to apply to all undertakings and enterprises or will there be some minimal cut-off point which would exclude those below a certain size, as is operated under EC Regulations 85 and 86?  Those regulations apply to undertakings above 200 million ECUs which is the last figure I heard.  That is about £150 million and I presume that would be applied on a ratio; it might be 1 per cent of our contribution to the EC and that would be an undertaking of, perhaps, £1.5 million here.  Are undertakings of £1.5 million, or some other figure, to be excluded from this?  If they are to be excluded is it the particular contract or agreement to that value that will be excluded or is it the firm's total turnover or capital size?  What are the criteria that will determine the size of the company that will be excluded?  Is the total company excluded in one instance?  If the company is above that statutory level in an agreement that involves that amount of money, is that agreement to be excluded?</P>
    <P>These are points that should be in the Bill and are not in it.  If parts of the agreement are found to fall within the meaning of a prohibited agreement under section 4 will the agreement be void or just the parts prohibited by that section? That is not clear from the Bill.</P>
    <P>What about existing agreements?  Are they to be declared void retrospectively? How will existing commitments be enforced if they are declared void in this way if the Bill, as the Minister wishes, becomes law by the summer?  There are, in business, such things as long term <Col N="1508" /> agreements, maybe stretching over a period of five or seven years, under which firms undertaken to buy a quantity of goods at a certain price over a long period.  These benefit the purchaser and the seller in as much as they allow the seller of the goods to organise his factory for a long period by accepting a lower price for his goods and ensures to the person he is supplying a range of goods at a certain price over a long period.  If that is declared void by the Bill, what will happen to that agreement?  Are the parties to that agreement liable in law to be sued?  Is the seller likely to be sued by the customer for not supplying the goods? These points need to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to grant licences which will permit the doing of acts which would otherwise be prohibited and void under section 4.  Licences are anathema and they should never be used in any connection.  We have had plenty of experiences to confirm that.  The Minister referred in his speech to exemption but the word used in the Bill is &ldquo;licences&rdquo;. Exemptions are granted by the EC under Articles 85 and 86.  Yet, in spite of the examples we have here of licences assuming capital value, we produce a Bill that seeks to issue more licences.  We should look at taxi licences, haulier licences, publican's licences.  They have assumed capital values where there should never be any value at all.</P>
    <P>A licence is something that permits one to do something and it should not assume a value itself.  Yet, in spite of having these examples of how licences have assumed a monetary value, the Minister has gone back to the old licence system which has proved disastrous here.  Certainly, a licence should not be part of a Bill that seeks to promote competition.  It is the opposite to competition.  It would be better to give exemptions, clearly outlined, than to use licences to grant exemptions. Exemptions should be defined in an objective manner with clear criteria. Obviously, to lift law from the European Community and put it into Irish law, would be difficult but this is one area <Col N="1509" /> where the Minister should do so.  The body of experience that has been built up since the signing of the treaties in the European Community regarding exemptions in this area can be applied here as well, but introducing licences is totally the wrong approach and should not have been contemplated at all.  Exemptions should not be given in the form of a licence which is peculiar to an undertaking or to a agreement.  The whole mechanism of operating a licence system requires administration, documentation and time.  We have plenty of experience in this country that they do not work. They are not in the interests of competition. Nor are they in the interests of the consumer because the cost of the licence then becomes built into the cost of the product being produced under the licence and the end result may be a restriction rather than an expansion of business practices.  Unfortunately for the party that set out to break the mould, they seem to have lost their way and have ended up merely refashioning the mould.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (5) is a far cry from open government.  That subsection says that the competition Authority, before granting a licence or issuing a certificate, may invite &ldquo;any Minister of the Government concerned with the matter&rdquo; to offer observations.  Why are members of the public who might have an interest not invited to make submissions?  Why are trades associations, lawyers and accountants not asked for their observations? This, again, is something that does not happen in the European Community. They put an advertisement in the papers inviting observations from those who may be concerned before they grant a licence; they set out precisely who is looking for this exemption, why they are looking for it and to whom it will apply and then they invite submissions and objections to it. Only a Minister of the Government who is concerned in the matter may apply. While section 7 (5) says the Authority may accept such observations or submissions from persons claiming to be interested, I think there should be provision to invite such submissions rather than just accepting them when they are <Col N="1510" /> made.  It is a defeat in the Bill that the competition Authority will not be inviting comments or submissions from members of the public and interested bodies.</P>
    <P>In order to be effective in its operation, competition requires vigilant consumers and competitors and for consumers to be vigilant they need to be well informed and aware of what is going on.  Furthermore, in subsection (6) the general public are only to be informed of the granting of a licence or a certificate when it is a <i>fait accompli.</i> The competition Authority are obliged to say publicly that they have granted such a licence when they decide to do it but only <i>post facto.</i> There is no machinery evident in the Bill to allow the public or interested competitors object to or give their observations on any application that is made. In subsection (7) the Authority may, at the request of the Minister, study, analyse and report on various issues.  That again is a change.  Why is this being tightened up again?  Why are the competition Authority not entitled to initiate investigations?  The Authority should be given explicit powers to initiate their own studies and investigations.  They should not have to wait for the Minister to ask them to do something.</P>
    <P>Legislation should not be put through this House on the basis of personalities. We should ensure that any legislation we pass will be applicable to conditions which may obtain when none of us are Members of this House.  It is not inconceivable that in years to come a matter which needs to be investigated cannot be investigated because the Minister, whoever he is, deliberately chose not to ask the competition Authority to initiate an investigation.  That matter could not be investigated and the Authority would have no power to do so.  That would be wrong.</P>
    <P>This applies also to section 14 which raises concerns regarding the overall direction in which the Minister seeks to go in the operation of this Bill.  It is not the dominant position of an undertaking which is the problem.  The Minister went to some lengths to define the term &ldquo;dominant position&rdquo;.  The IDA, who worked <Col N="1511" /> directly with the Minister, constantly underline the need for Irish companies to expand and develop.  They constantly say that we need Irish companies who can dominate Irish markets so that they can use that as a springboard to go abroad; we need to build up large Irish undertakings who almost, by definition, will be dominant in these markets.  In order to compete in the European and broader markets Irish companies should at least hold that dominant position in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a letter in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> from the Minister in which he criticises an article written last week on this Bill by &mdash; I do not want to mention this name &mdash; the Director of Competition Policy of the Confederation of Irish Industry.  The Minister in his letter accuses the director or writing a factually inaccurate and misleading article on the Bill.  This article bears out my point that the Bill is defective.  If the Director of Competition Policy of the Confederation of Irish Industry, who presumably is some sort of authority on this area, states that the Bill is defective then the Bill is not clear, it does not serve the purpose for which it was drafted and is not clear in its intention.  Having read both the article and the Minister's letter I have to say that I agree with the man who wrote the article, in other words; I do not think the article was inaccurate.  In the second paragraph of his letter the Minister states:</P>
    <P>Mr. Cregan states that &ldquo;setting up a Competition Policy and requiring prior notification of agreements&rdquo; will be particularly onerous in an economy like Ireland with so many small businesses. What the Bill proposes is that agreements &ldquo;which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade&rdquo; are prohibited and void.  Notification arises only where agreements of this type exist and the parties involved seek a licence (effectively an exemption from <Col N="1512" /> the prohibition or voiding of the agreement) from the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister is moving away from the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; towards the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; in his letter.  I hope this is what he is doing.</P>
    <P>I do not know how companies can decide, except by employing lawyers and accountants, whether an agreement is against the Bill.  The Minister states further in his letter that the article suggests that the only remedy the Bill contains to deal with the abuse of a dominant position is provided for in section 14.  He said that section 6 is more appropriate. However, section 6 deals with appeals to the High Court.  The Bill does not differentiate between very small shops and big firms such as Cement Roadstone or Carrolls &mdash; they will all have to go to the High Court.  No small shopkeeper can afford to go to the High Court to have his case heard &mdash; it could cost up to £10,000 or £20,000.</P>
    <P>The attitude adopted in section 14 is different from the attitude in the European Community.  Section 14 provides:</P>
    <P>(1)  Where the Minister is of the opinion that there is, contrary to section 5, an abuse of a dominant position he may request the Authority to carry out an investigation and the Authority shall comply with the request.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where the Authority holds an investigation pursuant to a request under subsection (1) it shall report thereon to the Minister and the report shall state whether in the opinion of the Authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a dominant position exists, and</P>
    <P>(b)  if it does, whether that dominant position is being abused.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister, having considered a report of the Authority under subsection (2), may, if the interests of the common good so warrant, after consultation with any other Minister of <Col N="1513" /> the Government concerned by order either&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  prohibit the continuance of the dominant position except on conditions specified in the order...</P>
    <P>He may prohibit the continuance of the dominant position but he does not have to eliminate the abuse.  This is the opposite of what is proposed in the EC. In fact, the European Community makes the point that it does not wish to remove the dominant position, it is the abuse it is concerned about.  Yet the Minister provides in this Bill that he may prohibit the dominant position and not the abuse. As I said earlier, this is a serious defect in the Bill and one which I will seek to change.</P>

However, as the section is presently worded a court, who will hear the appeal, may interpret is as meaning that the dominant position must be removed.  If the Minister brings in an amendment on Committee Stage which provides for the point I am making I will support it.  The Director of Competition Policy of the Confederation of Irish Industry, who is more qualified than I in this area has the same impression about this section as I have.  We may all be out of step but I ask the Minister to look at this point before Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>This approach contradicts sound industrial policy in this area.  Our priority must be to build strong, Irish located firms capable of competing internationally. This must be the foundation of our industrial policy.  This issue is one <Col N="1514" /> which a White Paper would have brought out into the open for discussion.</P>
      <P>The final paragraph of the Minister's letter clearly shows that he misinterpreted Mr. Cregan's article.  He said:</P>
      <P>Finally any suggestion that the Bill is incompatible with industrial policy is unsustainable as would be any suggestion that an industry should be allowed abuse a dominant position in the Irish market because it is competing in Europe.</P>
      <P>I find this distressing attitude among some Members of this House.  What Mr. Cregan actually said was that our national industrial policy, correctly, is to help Irish companies grow to such a scale in the Irish market that they can achieve the economies of scale required to be competitive in the European market.  Yet the Minister seems to have inadvertently interpreted Mr. Cregan's statement in his letter this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 deal with the powers of authorised officers.  A point arises here over section 21 (1) (a).  Reference is made to entering and inspecting premises at which activity, in connection with the organisation or assistance of persons engaged in business, is going on.  They do not say that in Europe; they refer to the firm concerned.  Section 21 refers to entering and inspecting premises at which activity, in connection with the organisation or assistance of persons engaged in business, is going on.  Does that mean that the lawyers' and accountants' offices can be inspected, as they are people who are assisting in the activity of the business? Why is there a difference between what happens in Europe and what happens here, even though we are being told that we are being prepared for Europe? This is capable of being interpreted so that lawyers' and accountants' offices can be inspected and can be entered by these officers to obtain evidence.  That is not the case in Europe where only the premises being investigated can be entered. What implications will this have for privileged communications between solicitors <Col N="1515" /> and their clients?  If a man has an agreement in his solicitor's office how can confidentiality between solicitor and client be maintained in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>A further issue arises in connection with whether people have a right to withhold self-incriminating evidence.  What is the Minister's attitude to that?  Is it proposed that this Authority would have powers beyond the powers already held in other offices of the State?</P>
    <P>The section dealing with membership of the Authority is out of date.  It has been virtually lifted from the 1972 Act with the best parts of it being left out. Section 4(2) says that a member of the Authority ceases to be a member on being nominated for the Seanad or on being elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament. Why are people nominated to the Seanad treated differently?  A person nominated for the Seanad must cease to be a member of the Authority whereas a person nominated for the Dáil only ceases to be a member of the Authority on being elected.  Under the 1972 Act if one became a member of the Seanad or the Dáil one had to give up one's seat on the Authority.  In other legislation in the past few years if a person is nominated for the Seanad one must give up one's seat on the Authority.  There might have been some rationale behind this when it was thought up some years ago, but I do not see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but he really gets himself wound up into knots about nothing, because he does not read what is in question, or take it into account.  The reference is to a member of the Authority being nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann is what it says.  In many instances Members of Seanad Éireann are never elected as members but are nominated as Members.  One cannot refer to them as being elected or say that they will only be disqualified&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister should have regard to the RTE Authority, in particular Ruairí Brugha who was in that position, if I remember correctly.  The same outmoded thinking is evident in section 6 of the Bill.  In a Europe without frontiers does it make any sense to stipulate that a member of the Authority must be ordinarily resident in the State?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not make sense in 1991 to have a clause like this for membership.  If somebody was living in, say, Newry he could not be a member. Likewise somebody well qualified in competition policy but living in Brussels could not get this job despite modern communications which would allow him do the job on a full-time basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes me longer to come from Cork to Dublin, and I am here every day, than it does to come from Brussels to Dublin.  For Heaven's sake, we are in the 1990s.  There are aeroplanes, fax facilities, telephones and so on.  We are talking about not convening at all to have meetings.  By reason of electronic wizardry we can sit in offices in different parts of the world while bringing our thoughts together in the one place.  The Minister is not bringing the legislation up to date.  He should not be that short-sighted about regulations; he is responsible for this.  Just because something was there in 1972 does not mean it is applicable now.  One might go back and find that the stipulation was there in the 1932 Act as well.  All those regulations should be updated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another omission in the Bill. <Col N="1518" /> Provision has not been made for preserving confidentiality and protecting business interests.  There was such provision in the 1972 Act and it is left out here.  It would have been far more important to leave that in than the outmoded thing about the directorships.  What guarantees do undertakings have, when applying for clearance for agreements, that the details of the agreements will not fall into the hands of competitors?  The 1972 Act at section 9(1) talked about confidentiality.  These issues place a question mark over the Minister's understanding of the manner in which business works.  The Bill does not make any provision for timescales for giving decisions. The Minister should be aware by now that time is crucial for business people and that delays can cost jobs.  Indeed delays with regard to the decision by the Authority will cause hardship and lost opportunities not only for the business community but for the economy and the smooth operation of decision-making and planning.  I need only remind the Minister of the sort of delays inherent in Bord Pleanála where sometimes there is nine months delay between an appeal and a decision.</P>
    <P>The Bill combines academic law and heavyhanded bureaucracy.  It is clearly lacking in business savvy and it is not in the interests of the business community nor, therefore, of the consumer.  Because the Bill is unclear in so many areas, it creates the uncertainty for business people about which I spoke earlier.  We should be wary of any of the Minister's contentions that this is an innocuous piece of business, because as now drafted this applies to every business from the smallest one man shop to the biggest companies in the country.</P>
    <P>The Bill suffers because there was a lack of consultation with the business community.  Their input could have been provided over the last two years had the Minister published a White Paper. However, the Minister seemed determined to produce a competition Bill just for the record and he is displaying a lack of concern for the shambles facing the business community at present.  The <Col N="1519" /> Minister has also failed to provide an overall context within which the Bill can operate.  For the most part the Bill comes across as a weak response to the needs of Irish industry.  The Minister has used a scissors and paste approach to the policy formulation; he has ended up taking two contrasting approaches, that in the Treaty of Rome, Articles 85 and 86 and in the Restrictive Practices Act and he has attempted to merge them, leaving out the best of both and putting in the worst of both.  That is an inappropriate mixture at any rate, but the failure to make the Bill clear is compounded by the Minister's failure to handle many of the issues I have raised here today.  For that reason, while supporting the principle of competition policy, I will propose amendments on Committee Stage.  The Minister in his speech said that he would be open to suggestion and would accept specific amendments.</P>
    <P>Businesses should be aware that one of the likely consequences of the Bill will be high compliance costs given that the decision of the Authority may be appealed to the High Court.  Certainly, no small business could contemplate even a relatively short hearing there because of the cost involved.  I will return to these and other questions on Committee Stage when I hope the Minister will examine carefully the amendments I will be proposing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to advise the House that the Labour Party will not be opposing the Bill on Second Stage as we feel any legislation which will lead to more effective and fair competition can only be good for the economy and for the consumer in particular. However, I also want to say at the outset that the growing culture in which the Bill is introduced is a privatisation culture and I will not support the Bill if it is presented as a privatiser's charter.  I have to say also that the claims which have already been made for the Bill have been somewhat exaggerated.  It is not by any means the most important legislation the Minister could have introduced in the House.  It <Col N="1520" /> will have a beneficial effect on aspects of our economic life but I do not see it as having the transforming and galvanising effect the Minister suggests.</P>
      <P>I understand the desperation with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is seeking to build monuments to his participation in Government, particularly wearing his other hat as leader of the minority Government partner, but I do not think this Bill is going to guarantee him a place in economic history.  In fact, if the Minister is looking for more realistic monuments perhaps I could suggest one or two to him which might bring home to him the thought that he would not be well advised to regard the Bill as an acceptable substitute for the radical overhaul of industrial policy that is necessary.  Any pretence that this Bill is some kind of panacea for unemployment would represent an utterly dishonest approach to the problems facing us.</P>
      <P>When the latest figures for European unemployment became available last week they painted an even more depressing picture than usual.  For the first time, since the end of the summer of 1985, the unemployment rate in the Community as a whole has experienced an increase in relation to the corresponding month of the previous year.  The latest figure available for unemployment across Europe is 8.5 per cent.  The reason European unemployment has begun to rise again on a year-by-year comparison is much higher than expected increases in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark, France and, of course, Ireland.  While the figures available do not yet take account of the changes in Germany, decreases in unemployment have occurred in Portugal, Italy and Spain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The upshot of all this is that we in Ireland are now firmly at the top of the European unemployment league with an unemployment rate which is almost twice that of the European average. Among men, the latest comparable figures for unemployment are 6.7 per cent in Europe as a whole and 15.7 per cent in Ireland.  Among women, the figures are 11.1 per cent in Europe as against 17.6 per cent in Ireland.  Among young <Col N="1521" /> people, the comparative figure which emerges is particularly grim: 16 per cent or one in six in Europe but almost one in four young people or 23.3 per cent appear on the live register in Ireland.  I should stress that these figures, which were compiled across Europe at the end of February, are already somewhat out-of-date. The past few months in Ireland have seen an inexorable rise in unemployment to a point where if the Government had any self-respect they would seek to ensure every single day that the crisis of unemployment is at the top of the political agenda.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the Bill desirable though it is seems to be almost a trivial response but there are other elements which must be considered.  I understand, for example, when the next ESRI medium-term review is published in one month's time or less it will contain very little that is optimistic in terms of unemployment or employment growth for the next five years.  The ESRI have been remarkably accurate in their medium-term forecasting in the past and their upcoming forecasts must be taken very seriously indeed.</P>
    <P>The growth in the economy which has been visible during the past few years is tapering away rapidly.  In any event much of the growth which we have already seen and are likely to see is in very restricted areas.  There has been substantial growth in multinational profits and the financial services sector but a great deal of this has already drained out of the economy and it has to be said that a continuation of the policy of wealthy companies of investing the bulk of their profits abroad will deny us the opportunity to benefit from that growth.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that the Government have no clear coherent industrial policy aimed at translating growth into wealth retained in Ireland and jobs for our workers.  We need radical changes in industrial policy to secure the concept of value added and to maximise investment in the economy.  Without real substantive change, our economic growth will continue to have more impact on job creation in America, Japan and Germany than it <Col N="1522" /> will here.  It is fundamentally important that we address the entire issue of industrial policy and its central importance in any re-examination of the role of smaller business and enterprises.</P>
    <P>The experience of the economy since independence has been the failure of job creation.  Associated with this, apart from certain brief periods we have had comparatively high levels of unemployment and unique levels of forced emigration by European standards.  Indeed, it has become impossible to consider the unemployment figures released on the first Friday of each month without taking the highest emigration figures in the European Community into account.  In this connection perhaps it is worth saying that there has been a great deal of talk and debate, justifiably so, about the legal and judicial extradition of Irish citizens but the media are almost completely silent how about the continuing scandal of the economic extradition of thousands of Irish people which continues at a disastrous pace.</P>
    <P>I see it as the Labour Party's task to place the goal of full employment as the fundamental objective of Government back on the agenda.  This needs to be demonstrated and expressed as a moral as well as a political commitment.  We believe that growth, competitiveness and job creation can and must be pursued in the context of our vision of a just and democratic economy but we recognise that there are a number of critical strategic objectives in ensuring long term economic growth and employment.  I would like to spell some of them out, as I see them, emphasising that this by no means is a comprehensive list.</P>
    <P>First, no small country has achieved self-sustaining industrial growth and expansion in employment based mainly on multinational investment from abroad.  A strong domestic industrial base is and must be of central importance. The objective must be to increase wealth creation and retain that wealth and value added in Ireland.  This is simply not being achieved by current industrial policy.  If it were, we would be ensuring that at least some of the £2 billion repatriated <Col N="1523" /> multinational profits that left Ireland last year was reinvested in this country.</P>

      <P>Could I refer the Minister to the beginning of his speech on the Competition Bill where he is talking about this Bill as being necessary and that it will play a fundamental role &ldquo;to revitalise the economy, to encourage growth and thereby address the most pressing problem facing us all &mdash; unemployment&rdquo;? He says: it will bring about basic restructuring of the marketplace by introducing into it a statutorily protected requirement for competition.  I am telling him it will require more than this Competition Bill to obtain the very objective he is advocating in the opening lines of his Second Stage speech.  What I am saying is very relevant.  I am saying what he ought to be doing to bring about the objective which he says in the opening words of his speech is highly desirable.  I do not know if it is better to have the Minister for Industry and Commerce asleep, as he was in some part of Deputy Barry's speech, or conducting himself by way of interruption, as though this was some kind of Committee Stage debate, or trying to dominate the scene from that position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>Another major factor is that we have an inappropriate mix of firm sizes with too few firms capable of achieving the scale of activity necessary for a sustained, long term competitive position in international markets.  This is expressed in too low expenditures on R and D marketing and management development.  This problem is greatly added to and is, to a great degree, reflected by our geographic distance from large markets with high transport costs, a small population domestic market and <Col N="1524" /> a lack of co-ordinated growth and employment strategy by the major EC economies.</P>
      <P>There is a fundamental dilemma facing many small companies here.  In the context of a more integrated Europe with trade barriers tumbling, the businesses that will be best equipped to thrive will be those big enough to take advantage of economies of scale, or alternatively those that can offer excellence in terms of quality and reliability of supply.  This is the case whether we are talking about manufacturing or service companies.  Only the biggest or the best will flourish in the most competitive environment we are likely to see.</P>
      <P>Issues such as quality and reliability are central.  No small business can compete effectively if it has failed to get its act together, but small industry is also subject to considerations over which it has no control.  For example, this time last year the Labour Party pointed out that there would be room for an immediate reduction in interest rates on mortgages if it were not for excessive caution on the part of the Central Bank.  The consequence is that we have one of the highest real rates of interest in Europe.  The gap between the rate of inflation here and our interest rate is not only unacceptably high, it is also causing considerable hardship to many middle income families who are crippled by mortgages and it is inhibiting the development of the economy because the cost of credit is unnecessarily high.  No one suffers more from real interest rates than small businesses crippled by unnecessary overheads.</P>
      <P>The main reason for all this is that the Central Bank are concerned to ensure that reserves are kept well above their minimum acceptable level of £2 billion. It would surely be appropriate for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to be devoting some of his time to expressing concern about this continuing conservatism and ensuring that the building societies and other lending institutions are encouraged to bring real interest rates down to appropriate levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it would be nice to be able to predict that the banks will respond <Col N="1525" /> immediately and will ensure that the development of jobs and enterprises is not stymied by artificially high interest rates.</P>

      <P>Deputy, I have given you latitude in making passing reference to a number of economic issues. You should get back now to the details in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, I am doing that. This is all very relevant to the Bill in the economic context set by the Minister in his opening speech.  The Labour Party have called on several occasions for the establishment of a commission of inquiry into the regulation of the financial serices industry; at every level the financial sector would benefit from such an investigation. A recent study published by <i>Consumer Choice</i> illustrates the scandalous range of charges imposed by the commercial banks on individual and business customers.  How will this Bill effect that situation?</P>
      <P>There can be very little justification for these charges other than the contribution they make to the banks already very large profits.  These charges are imposed in the main without customers being made aware of them.  Indeed, I imagine most customers would be both astonished and outraged to know for what they were being charged and, despite the publicity that has been generated to these charges, there has been little or no effort by the banks to reform themselves or, at the very least, to inform their customers comprehensively about the charges they levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If ever there was a case for ensuring that fair competition was allowed and encouraged, it lies in the hidden and secret cartel run by the main banks.  Of course, they will deny hotly that they operate a cartel at all, but I for one would welcome an assurance by the Minister that the banks will be one of the first targets for investigation when this Bill becomes law.  I would go further.  I would argue that a commission of inquiry into the financial services sector would reveal that that sector makes a contribution to economic development which falls far <Col N="1526" /> short of the benefits it receives from our economy.  Where small business in particular is concerned, the least that small businesses are entitled to is the assurance of fair play in their dealings with financial institutions and the hope that the banks will be willing to support a concept of reasonable risk in the context of economic development.  The absence of that assurance is inhibiting the growth of jobs and the development of a more secure future for us all.</P>
    <P>I referred to the possibility of a privatiser's charter inherent in this Bill.  I would reject absolutely any notion that this Bill could or should be used to begin an assault on existing semi-State companies either by way of breaking them up or by privatising them wholesale.  Deputy Barry asked if the semi-State companies would come within the ambit of this Bill. In reply let me say it is quite clear to me they most certainly do come within its ambit as do private companies.  I recognise fully that, in the wake of last week's ESB dispute which caused so much inconvenience and not a little hardship, there is a great deal of public feeling against the ESB and public sector monopolies in general.</P>
    <P>However, major questions of this kind must be examined as dispassionately and objectively as possible.  We should let the dust settle before we make decisions on them.  That is not to say that we should do nothing about the ESB situation, far from it.  We urgently need to know what went wrong there, not particularly from the point of view of assigning blame, since in my experience there are always at least two sides to every industrial relations row, but if this situation is to be prevented from recurring, particularly if that has to be done on a voluntary basis, we need to know just why communications and relations became so bad so quickly.</P>
    <P>In regard to the issue of privatisation generally, important in the context of this Bill, there may be sound economic arguments in favour of wholesale privatisation, but if there are, why are the proponents of the concept so shy about putting them forward?  For example, why <Col N="1527" /> does the Minister for Industry and Commerce not prepare and publish a White Paper on this subject?</P>
    <P>One other point must be made about the principles inherent in this Bill.  It is a great pity &mdash; a tragedy &mdash; that the Minister who is proposing the Bill did not choose to apply its principles in his consideration of the Goodman case.  That was the last occasion on which he was asked to exercise the power vested in him to protect the national interest.  What a pity he has missed every opportunity open to him to use that power to ensure that at least one enterprise who has consistently misused a dominant position in the market place was brought to heel.  It makes me wonder if there is any room for confidence that this Bill will ever make a significant difference.</P>
    <P>When we come to deal with the minutiae of the Bill, the Labour Party will be putting forward a number of amendments. The Minister must retain both a right and a duty to investigate abuses and it is not clear that this power will still exist after the passage of the Bill.  It appears that he will have to rely on the new competitions authority to do so and we regard this as unnecessarily limiting.  We also believe that where individuals are adversely affected by anti-competitive practices there should be provision enabling them to apply to the Minister for assistance in prosecuting a case.</P>
    <P>The nub of this Bill, and the enforcement of the concept behind it, is dealt with in a very peculiar and strange manner.  The Minister is saying that anti-competitive practices are illegal, unlawful and prohibited by law.  That is right and proper.  Where is the main thrust in this legislation to carry that into effect? The standard norm is that when something prohibited by law is breached, it is a matter for some State authority, a Minister, the DPP or the Director of Fair Trading to receive complaints, carry out investigations and bring a prosecution. That is the normal and proper way to do it.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister doing in this Bill? For practical purposes he is giving the <Col N="1528" /> whole matter over to the private individual or private firm to enforce it themselves. He is enunciating the right but anybody who wants to do something about it must go to the High Court and establish the complex, difficult and expensive proofs necessary to succeed in a claim under section 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill.  It is asking a bit much and it does not stand up in common sense.  I say this as a person who has some experience of conducting cases in the High Court and in the Supreme Court.  The standard of proof that would be required to set up a claim by an individual or company under section 6 would be very high.  It would have to be established that a huge company, probably a multinational or an enormously wealthy conglomerate, have gained a dominant position in the market and has abused that position.</P>
    <P>At least two key elements of proof would be required.  It is no use going into the witness box in the High Court and asserting that a company have established a dominant position in the market. That must be proved and established. It would be necessary to establish the volume of particular goods sold in Ireland and the percentage of the market captured by the company in question.  It would require at least a highly skilled economist or a team of economists to establish that.  The economists might have to go around the country doing research and examination.  They may have to spend many hours or days investigating the market position of the company and considering whether it had reached a dominant position.  The cost of getting an economist or team of economists to do all that would be no small sum.  Lawyers do not come cheaply either.</P>

      <P>This is major litigation.  It has to be borne in mind that the multinational company would have an opposing team of leading counsel, the finest brains that money could buy, with their own team of economists.  It would be a daunting prospect to undertake an <Col N="1529" /> expensive case under this legislation.  Are there many individuals or companies who, faced with the kind of oppression envisaged in this Bill, would have the financial resources behind them to undertake the litigation that the Minister is authorising or who would be minded to do it, knowing that if anything went wrong they could be ruined?  The costs of losing are mindboggling.  The case could run for a week in the High Court and for several more days in the Supreme Court. The effect of such a loss on a moderately sized company could spell absolute ruin. It would require tremendous resources and motivation to propel a person or a company into taking a case to the High Court, with the likelihood of an appeal to the Supreme Court.  What is the Minister purporting to do in this legislation, claiming that this will be some kind of panacea for the economy and employment?  Is this a try-on or a suggestion that there will be some magical upturn in employment, in competitiveness, or fair business or trading, as a result of the enactment of this Bill?</P>
      <P>If the Minister is serious in saying he wants to implement the directives of the EC, give them real effect, teeth and meaning here, he must tell this House that this is a matter that requires State backing.  We must set up the State prosecution investigative service, whether it be the competition authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade or whoever, but it must be an investigatory and prosecution authority backed by State resources.  One cannot leave that to some hapless, hounded, private individual or small company being hounded out of business by unfair practices on the part of some multi-million conglomerate and multinational company who are taking some hapless company, trying to make a living and provide some employment here, by the scruff of the neck and shaking them until the pips squeak.  That is not the way to do this; it will not work and cannot work in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister too has a right to apply to the High Court for damages and an injunction under the provisions of <Col N="1530" /> section 6; he retains that power to himself. But reading the section it becomes quite obvious to anybody that it is an afterthought.  There is no real meaning there at all; no real intent that the Minister will undertake such prosecutions. Had that been the intent the Bill would have been structured quite differently. The whole thrust of the Bill &mdash; which places the question of effecting the remedy slap in the hands of the private individual or private company &mdash; would not be there.  As we all know, in this era of cutbacks one must question whether the Minister will have the staff, the investigators, the teams of economists and lawyers, or have the requisite moneys placed at his disposal.  It is not on at all.</P>
    <P>Even if one arrives at the stage that proceedings are brought, that some very brave individual, or company, decides that he will retain a team of economists or lawyers they will sweat it out for a week in the High Court and three days in the Supreme Court.  The case will be argued out, he will establish the dominant position, what percentage of the market the multinational had, what extent they had abused it, but, even if all of that is established &mdash; which will involve some effort &mdash; and he wins the case, what then? What will be the effect of all of that?  Will that be something terrible as far as the multinational is concerned?  Will it really hit him for six?  Will it really make all that much difference to him?</P>
    <P>Let us examine what will be its effect and what the Bill provides.  It says that the High Court can award damages.  What would be the amount of the damages? How are damages computed in our courts?  The rule in the awarding of damages is to try, so far possible, to reinstate the injured person to the same financial position he would have been in had the offence not taken place.  In other words, to get damages he has to be able to prove how much was his loss, how much he lost as a result of this breach of the competition law.  He would have to prove how much more profit he would have made had this competition law not been breached by the conglomerate or multinational against which he is bringing the <Col N="1531" /> claim.  That, in itself, is not easy to establish or prove.</P>
    <P>It is difficult enough when one is running a business, or engaging in a certain amount of business to say: &ldquo;well, I would have done a lot better had fair competition applied, had this cartel arrangement not operated against me&rdquo;.  It is easy to contend that he would have done much better but how much better would he have done?  He must establish that; he has to tell the court.  The court will say: &ldquo;you come in here looking for damages; how much have you lost; how much damage have you in fact sustained; do not tell us it could have been this, might have been that or that it was within this range or that&rdquo;.  That would not be accepted in the High Court; it would be thrown out. He must prove his loss before a court will award him damages.  Even if he does that all he will be doing is putting himself back to square one, reinstating what he should have been earning by way of profit in the first place if the breach of the competition law had not taken place.</P>
    <P>It is true that there is provision for exemplary damages.  Exemplary damages are a strange animal.  There is no certainty about how that would work or how the judges would award such damages. It is not something that is very commonplace in our law.  As far as I can recall, it exists only in connection with the law of libel and is not often awarded in any appreciable amount.  There is a fair reluctance on the part of judges to become involved in the area of exemplary damages because they are too vague, too broad, there is nothing specific about them.  Even if a court was motivated to award some sum for exemplary damages the probability is that they would not be large enough to be in a meaningful and realistic way teach the multinational, or conglomerate a lesson to obey the provisions of the Bill.  It is true that there is provision for an injunction that would restrain the conglomerate from breaching the law in the future.  I can envisage that provision being effective. Certainly, an injunction would be a very effective remedy in controlling future <Col N="1532" /> abuse by that company in respect of a commodity.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves: is it adequate to, as the Minister is doing in the Bill, simply provide for damages and exemplary damages?  Is that what is done in other countries in similar circumstances? Certainly it is not.  In fact, it is far from it. What is done?  How is the matter tackled? How do the EC laws cover penalties for a breach of anti-competition regulations? The procedure is quite different, more effective.  The EC Commission, under regulation 17/62, may impose fines for a breach of up to 10 per cent of the turnover of the company in the country in which they have committed the violation.  For example, in 1986 the producers of polypropylene were fined, for breaches of the EC competition rules, a total of 58 million ECUs, that is to say, approximately £43 million for a breach, being 10 per cent of their turnover.  That is a very different kind of picture to the one envisaged in this Bill.  What is envisaged in this Bill, by way of sanction on a multinational, is small beer, would have very little meaning and, by no stretch of the imagination, would it operate as a sanction to make them think twice before breaching the competition regulations.</P>
    <P>Apart from the polypropylene case there are other cases of individual companies having received fines of between 10 million ECU and 11 million ECU, approximately £7 million.  The position in the United Kingdom is that in July 1989 a White Paper was published entitled &ldquo;Opening Markets &mdash; New Policy on Restrictive Trade Practices&rdquo;.  Their recommendation is the same as that applicable in the EC, namely, for a fine of up to 10 per cent of the turnover of the company in the country where they are breaking the competition rules.  The British White Paper recommends also that directors and managers responsible for negotiating agreements be liable to fines of up to £100,000.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I cannot see that the Bill as it stands now will be effective. What is being done here is to deal with what, in effect, is a criminal matter, making it an offence but leaving it to a <Col N="1533" /> civil remedy to enforce: those two do not mix.  If an important prohibition is introduced here, the matter ought to be dealt with not by way of civil proceedings in the High Court &mdash; although it should be open to any person who has lost as a result to bring a claim for damages as well &mdash; but by means of a prosecution at the suit of some appropriate State agency, the most appropriate being, I suppose, the new authority being created under the provisions of the Bill.  There should be a prosecution by that authority in an appropriate court, be it the District Court, the Circuit Court or whatever, under a provision which would impose a fine of up to 10 per cent of the turnover of the offending company in the country where they have abused a dominant position if they are found guilty of having done so.</P>
    <P>It follows that if that course is to be adopted, the necessary skilled, professional staff should be provided to enable the authority to make that sanction meaningful.  There is no point in giving the Authority the power to do that unless the skilled economists are made available to them to carry out the investigations, to establish the fact that there was a dominant position and, indeed, to be able to tell a court what is a dominant position.  The Minister said this Bill was transparent.  I find that incredible.  It is the most opaque legislation one could possibly find.  I do not see where the transparency arises.  He concedes that what is a dominant position is not defined, as though that had some merit. The Law Library boys could be down in the High Court and Supreme Court arguing long and hard as to whether 50 per cent, 40 per cent or 60 per cent was or was not a dominant position in the context of a particular commodity.  It could be different in the case of every commodity.  Different judges may take a different view.  The Bill is an absolute goldmine for litigation as it stands.  Lawyers of all descriptions must be very pleased with this legislation.  In the ten years or so I have been in the Dáil I have never yet seen legislation that is more of a ready-made bonanza for the legal <Col N="1534" /> profession.  Every section that you read screams; the legislation is wide open and the legal resources that could be called in to play here, for companies that can afford to avail of them, will be huge.  Is that the objective of the Bill?  That will be the effect of the Bill.  The Minister will need to examine it again.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we in the Labour Party support what the Minister is trying to do but he is not going about it in the proper way and the Bill will turn out to be a non-issue from the word go.  If the Minister wants to protect the jobs and the consumer he will have to ensure that the Bill is effective.  As it stands at present, clearly that is not so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to reiterate the remarks of Deputy Barry concerning when the Bill was made available to Opposition Deputies.  I felt that Deputy Barry would go on to deal with the wider question of the trend in the House, which is to publish Bills that, on the Minister's own advocacy, are as central and instrumental as this Bill and yet we get the minimum amount of time in which to consider them.  This happened with the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill, and now it has happened with the Competition Bill.  Deputy Barry's point ought to be taken on board by the Government. It is not acceptable on an issue as complex and as important as this to present us with this Bill on a Thursday &mdash; if you are lucky &mdash; and to take Second Stage on the ensuing Tuesday.  For those of us who have neither the array of Civil Service expertise that is available to the Minister, nor perhaps the unsolicited expertise of vested interests outside, it is extremely difficult to deal with the minutiae of a Bill such as this in the manner one would like in the time provided.  It is a great pity that that trend has developed with this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the view that, as the Minister sought to describe it in his contribution, this Bill should be, as it was presaged in any event, a central instrument in what the Minister calls &ldquo;this Government's programme to revitalise the economy&rdquo;. That is the case the Minister has been <Col N="1535" /> making for many months.  The largest Opposition Party pursued him every morning in the Dáil concerning the publication date of this Bill, so obviously they also regard it as a very important measure.  Therefore, it is entirely unacceptable that the Bill does not turn out to be the major measure we were led to believe.</P>
    <P>Secondly, Deputy Taylor made the case at the outset of his contribution that this Bill can be taken only in the wider context of industrial policy generally and he sketched in the extent of the endemic problem of unemployment, of which Members on all sides of the House are aware.  I do not want to follow him down that road but at this stage the litany of failure of our existing industrial policy has very much achieved consensus status in this House.  The extent of emigration and unemployment speaks for itself in so far as the unemployed and those living in the poverty trap are concerned.  Many of the favourable economic indicators seem to be pretty academic from their point of view.  The fact of the matter is that there are up to 300,000 people unemployed and emigration is running at a level similar to what it was in the mid-fifties.  I merely want to record that it is regrettable that although the Minister promised a major review of industrial policy and had available to him the second triennial report on industrial performance &mdash; which was published some months ago, almost a year later than promised &mdash; we are unable yet to have a major comprehensive debate in this House on industrial policy. Time and again we are forced to respond in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion to aspects of the problem and to limited measures that clearly do not encompass the entire scale of the problem.  Quite clearly, competition policy is an aspect of wider industrial strategy and policy.  It would be much better if this House could respond to the wider questions, such as the extension of the tax regime to the multinational sector and whether we get value for money on industrial policy spending <Col N="1536" /> before focusing on what are merely aspects of the problem.</P>
    <P>Far from publishing a White Paper on industrial policy, the Minister &mdash; whether for reasons of internal difficulty in the Government or otherwise &mdash; seems to have adopted the approach of reform by stealth, in so much as the triennial report is gathering dust somewhere while the Minister has announced minimal measures of reform of the agencies in the industrial promotions sector and the IDA have taken on board reforms in terms of reviewing the efficacy of the traditional policy of doling out enormous grants and subsidies to attract foreign industries compared with alternative methods such as taking an equity participation in companies and so on.  Nonetheless, the Minister had decided, perhaps for reasons relating to dispute within the Government, that we cannot discuss this central economic question because the facts of the matter are, and nobody can dispute this, that unemployment and emigration, both sides of the same coin, are the single biggest problem facing the country.  Yet we cannot have an overview debate on industrial policy.  We are forced, time and again to respond to what are merely aspects of the wider problem.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have to agree with the other Opposition spokesperson that the Bill is a major disappointment.  Having regard to the background of publicity and promotion that led to its eventual publication &mdash; time and again the Minister took time out to tell us that this Bill would be a major instrument of policy in revitalising the economy and thereby contributing to growth and expansion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>It may surprise you that the Bill before us is an aspect of industrial policy.  However, if the Chair does not interrupt me again, I promise I will not stray.  I have made the point that I wished to make.  I hope, Sir, that your party Leader, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will provide us with an early opportunity for a debate on that subject.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a disappointment, having regard to the expectations of its merits, scope, comprehensiveness and effect that we were led to have.  In fact, having had the experience of the radical changes the Minister introduced to the Companies Act, one might have expected that this Minister would have lived up to his commitments to introduce a Competition Bill which would be similarly radical in nature and broad in scope but that has not happened at all in this Bill.  One wonders why its scope is so limited and why, in fact, it is likely to have a minimalist impact on the domestic Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we are discussing the Bill is a testament that the concept of the free market is an illusion and that there is an acceptance by the very necessity of the Bill that the free market is distorted by various anti-competitive practices, aggregation, price fixing, collusion, abuse of dominant position and so forth.  Indeed I <Col N="1538" /> argue that the search for perfect competion is chasing the Holy Grail.  Adam Smith's dictum that wherever two businessmen meet to drink coffee there is suspicion that they are meeting to discuss price fixing is probably still as valid at the end of the 20th century as it was in the 19th century.  Competition is necessary for a dynamic economy and in the best interests of the consumer.  The Government must intervene to establish regulatory mechanisms to allow competition to function in the interests of consumer welfare and, one would hope of economic growth.  This Bill overly reflects the ideological conviction of the Minister's own party that it is merely the absence of a proper legislative environment in the area of competition that impedes pure competition and the prosperity of business. The Minister clearly believes that competition in a legal framework is only the means to allow competition forces to operate.  In other words, the business sector will exploit the opportunities given to them in the public interest if only they are allowed to be more competitive.  I am afraid the Adam Smith conspiracy theory still has validity.  There is no perfect competition. There are areas of tendency towards aggregation and there are areas of tendency towards natural monopoly. I do not believe there is a competitive solution to everything.  The Bill seems to say, establish a competitive framework and let them at it.  The free market forces should thrive and prosper once we enshrine the concept of competition legally. Then wherever we find anti-competitive practices the Minister seems to be saying, I will root them out.  In a way, it is the other side of the coin of the 19th century anti-union legislation which, Deputies will recall, until the passing of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, regarded trade unions as conspiracies.</P>
    <P>The tendency towards natural monopoly I spoke about is not necessarily undesirable.  Since the Bill accepts that it is only the abuse of dominant position that is ruled out, perhaps it accepts this approach.  However when it comes to some of the so-called State monopolies I look forward to hearing the Minister's <Col N="1539" /> assessment of whether he accepts that industries, such as energy, communications, water and a number of others, fit into this tendency towards natural monopoly.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Minister chooses to abolish the existing mechanisms in favour of a new competition Authority which amazingly can only be triggered by the Minister himself.  Surely what is required is an independent, executive, sceptical, suspicious, pro-active Authority which initiate their own investigations and studies, quite apart from the views of whoever happens to be the Minister of the day. Indeed it flies in the face of the arms length trend of recent years in the public service which caused bodies like Telecom Éireann, An Post and even the office of the Ombudsman to be established.  It leaves the new Authority open to the vagaries of the political and cultural disposition of the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day.  It is unthinkable in a political culture of patronage and against the backdrop of our recent record of collusion between business and politics that this Minister should advocate the creation of such a critical new Authority as a tool of the Minister rather than as an executive, independent Authority that is its own matter.</P>
    <P>The Workers' party support the introduction of as competitive an economic and commercial environment as possible. The welfare of the consumer should be central to any competition policy. However, this Bill is obviously the progeny of a divided Government and reflects in a number of critical areas that it is the product of compromise and fudge rather than the hard-headed measure that the Government would have us believe.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with the central question &mdash; one of the very few changes from the present position, because this is not a very extensive or imaginative Bill &mdash; the proposal by the Minister to create a competition Authority. This is dealt with in Part III of the Bill.  It is quite extraordinary that the <Col N="1540" /> Minister, Deputy O'Malley, of all Ministers should have gone down this road. That a Minister with Deputy O'Malley's experience, background and record in these matters can advocate the establishment of a competition Authority which, as I read it, quite clearly must await the Minister of the day causing them to investigate whatever matter is being complained of, is an extraordinary <i>volte-face.</i> Section 11, Part III, of the Bill clearly states:</P>
    <P>The Authority may, at the request of the Minister, [I underline that] study and analyse and, when requested by the Minister, [I underline that] report to him the results of any such study or analysis, any practice or method of competition affecting the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services.  A study or analysis may consist of, or include, a study or analysis of any development outside the State.</P>
    <P>That is repeated elsewhere in the Bill.  It seems that this Authority are inert unless the Minister of the day triggers their investigation into whatever issue is being complained of.  Surely that is the direct opposite to what is required.  Even under the present position I would argue that it is more efficacious and effective than that.</P>
    <P>It is particularly extraordinary that the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, should bring forward such a proposal when he has time and again, quite properly in my view, indicated the political practice and political culture in this country where too often business and politics have been hand in glove.  Too frequently we have seen examples of that phenomenon that have done us damage internationally, and yet the Minister is prepared to come in here and argue to put on the Statute Book legislation that will be dependent on the disposition of the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day as to whether it is activated.  I find that completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The most generous complexion you can put on it is that it will put undue pressure on the Minister of the day, that <Col N="1541" /> he will be left open to all kinds of special pleading, that those with the inside track to the Minister of the day will be able to do exactly what they are not supposed to be able to do as a result of this Bill, and to do what caused this Bill to be brought before the House in the first place, that is, to pressure the Minister of the day into not proceeding with an investigation in a certain set of circumstances.  That is not even fanciful.  We know well from the very recent history of business in this country that that, in all probability, will happen.  Therefore that section, in my view, neuters the Bill; it is virtually worthless.  If there is an extraordinary Minister of the day who is so even-handed and well balanced that without fear or favour he will act, then perhaps it will work all right, but no such Minister, from any side of this House, has yet been born, and is unlikely to be born.</P>
    <P>Very recently we had the experience of the Goodman case.  Although that still lingers on in so much as the decision in respect of the Bandon plant and the Classic Meats takeover remains unresolved, it is not clear, going on the experience since last August when this House was reconvened, that the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, who is generally not known to be in particularly warm contact with the principal of that group of companies, would take a stand in that situation where there was gross abuse of the dominant position, to put it at its mildest.</P>
    <P>I am dealing very centrally with the Bill now and I can rely on the Minister of State to relay to Minister O'Malley &mdash; who was too impatient to stay &mdash; that I do not think very much of section 11.  The kind of mechanism which the situation requires is an independent, statutory Authority which is well resourced, which has available to it the expertise which can be quite complex in a situation like this. If that Authority think it proper, based on its knowledge from whatever source, that it should intrude itself into the resolution or tackling of the issue, then it should do so.  It is a major defect in the Bill; what is needed is an independent body, pro-active, which can initiate its <Col N="1542" /> own investigations and studies and prosecute on behalf of the complainant, if it thinks fit, a particular action, depending on the circumstances.  I agree with the remarks of Deputy Taylor in his contribution on this aspect.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that the remedies suggested in the Bill are practicable in the kind of situation we can anticipate.  The Minister seems to be abdicating his responsibility in this area; he is saying to the individual &mdash; or to the individual enterprise &mdash; that if they are aggrieved they should go to the High Court.  Deputy Taylor, who has more experience of that than I have, instanced how impractical that can be in a great many circumstances, how expensive it undoubtedly is and how expensive it will be to garner the kind of evidence necessary to comply with the standard of proof likely to be required in important cases such as this.</P>
    <P>As well as that, you are not dealing with <i>prima centra pares;</i> you could have very unequal partners locked in litigation. The small businessman or small trader who is expected to take on the might of one of the multinationals, whose practices he is complaining about or who threatens his livelihood, and that of a small number of workers employed by him, will not be engaged in an equal struggle.  Indeed, if one looks at the monopolies area, there is one thing certain, it will be virtually impossible to establish accurate information on the context of market share.</P>
    <P>In the Goodman affair we saw that his claim to market share went up and down depending on the expendiency of the moment.  When it suited him he owned a great deal more &mdash; or controlled a great deal more &mdash; than 40 per cent but, when it did not suit him, it went down to 28 per cent.  In fact, to this day, as the Minister admitted in reply to a parliamentary question from me last week, we still do not know the entire extent of market share in that sector.  It will be extremely difficult to assemble that kind of industrial information and, therefore, all the more onus will be placed on whoever is <Col N="1543" /> prosecuting an action, the unequal struggle which I mentioned is likely to make it simply impractical in most cases where it would be valuable.  Not only should the Competition Authority have executive powers, it should also have the power to prosecute on behalf of the complainant in circumstances it thinks proper the particular action and, in certain circumstances, the entire question of penalties which can be imposed need to be further examined.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, after all the promotions to which we have listened over recent months, the Bill seems to have been very hurried legislation and the critical Part III seems to have been born out of compromise in Government.  In my assessment it is not the view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It flies in the face of a practice which has now become a trend in the public service.  We set up An Bord Telecom; it was a good arms length decision because, with all due respect to civil servants &mdash; although I am a great admirer of many civil servants &mdash; the place for them is in the Civil Service, not running a commercial enterprise.  The performance of Telecom Éireann since they are not under the aegis of the Civil Service has proved the merit of that.  However, we did it at arms' length to such an extent that one cannot even put down a question in the House to the Minister.  We did the same with An Post; we set up a separate body and we have taken similar decisions on aspects of the financial area.  We set up the Ombudsman's Office and yet when it comes to an authority in such a critical area of the economy, it comes directly under the aegis of the Minister of the day, it is no more really than a creature of his Department.</P>
    <P>I am sure we can give the benefit of the doubt to the high calibre, well intentioned people who will comprise the membership of the Authority but, without the say-so of the Minister, they are impotent.  I look forward to the Minister dealing with that point in his reply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor asked about the situation in other countries, and he referred <Col N="1544" /> to the EC itself and to Britain.  The comparable authority in Germany has a great deal more teeth and I would have thought, whether one comes from the Social Democratic or Christian Democratic tradition, perhaps that was the minimum we were likely to get in this country.  It is interesting to note the decision which that authority came to in the Daimler case where the Government decided to overrule the recommendation. I can see nothing wrong with that.</P>
    <P>I think that that division of the economic from the political is precisely what the situation requires.  If the Authority, then, having assessed on economic criteria a particular case that it is seized of, comes to a decision and the Government of the day do not like that decision, then let the Government overrule it.  At the end of the day nobody can question the primacy of politics and the authority of the Government to make the ultimate decision.  If there are political considerations that cause the Government to take a particular approach that does not fall in the economic rationale that led the Authority to take their decision, then so be it.  The people have elected the Government and that is the decision; but let us not have this political meddling <i>ab initio</i> which is the situation we have here.  The Authority are reduced to the stature of a tool of the Minister rather than being their own master.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barry and Taylor made the point that this Bill is a goldmine for lawyers. That is evidently the case.  It is again one of the extraordinary ironies of this Bill that the last Minister in this Government one would expect to produce a lawyers's charter for endless valuable briefs is the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is known to have a particular view about that profession and, indeed, about some of the practices in that profession, and I do not know whether his Bill will tackle the problems in this profession effectively.  There is an inducement to litigation as the only remedy in this Bill.  It is a defect in it that the Authority have not been given some stature in this area and that the kind of role <Col N="1545" /> we saw the Director of Consumer Affairs playing in the area I am talking about is now abolished.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take the opportunity to inquire how the Minister thinks this Bill will affect some of the traditional areas where it is suspected cartels have been and are being operated within the economy.  It seems that it is the general wisdom in the House that it is proper to import into domestic law the contents of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. I am not so sure that the original purpose of those Articles on a Europe wide canvas in the context of a common market are in all cases appropriate for imposition on a small domestic Irish marketplace. Quite clearly the EC itself has used those powers in the interests of the consumer and in the interests of creating a more efficient and dynamic economy in certain areas, some of them very high profile. Indeed, the powers taken by the Commissioner for Competition have been extremely rigorous.  Very extensive powers are available to the Commissioner if he chooses to use them, and more and more the last Commissioner for Competition and the present one are doing so.</P>
    <P>In yesterday morning's <i>Financial Times</i> there was an interesting example of that in an article entitled &ldquo;US lobs a cutprice spanner into Europe's cosy soda ash market&rdquo;.  It details the case of two companies, ICI and a Belgian company called Solvay that had dominated the very valuable market for this particular chemical called soda ash on the entire European continent.  It is quite clear, as the article euphemistically puts it, that Solvay and ICI abandoned their formal market sharing agreement in the sixties, and insisted that there is now no collusion between them.  But they did have a share out of the market arranged between them as a result of which the EC fined them £48 million ECUs or £33.4 million for allegedly running a soda ash cartel.  They also lifted an anti-dumping duty that had kept US producers out of Europe.</P>
    <P>ICI effectively supplied the British and Irish market and Solvay effectively had <Col N="1546" /> control over the remainder of the European market.  The Americans could not get into it.  Now the EC Commissioner has weighed into that &mdash; I see the companies are appealing against these fines and so on &mdash; and the outcome will be very interesting to watch.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the concepts enshrined in Articles 85 and 86 are not for that kind of transnational commercial abuse rather than coping with the kind of situation that has brought such outrage from, say, the grocery trade in this country. At the beginning of his contribution Deputy Barry referred to the fact that, to his knowledge, the Minister had engaged in very little consultation with the various sectors of industry contending that, if they are not concerned with this Bill yet, they will be concerned with it after it is passed.  It appears that there has been very little consultation on a Bill that is as important and far-reaching in its implications as this one.  For example, RGDATA, for whom I do not hold any particular brief &mdash; but it seems to me that they are entitled to be heard &mdash; argue very strongly that, although they welcome the concept and the intent behind the Bill, they are satisfied that it will have a negative effect on their trade unless it is amended.  They say that the trade is extremely vulnerable in that the Bill is proceeding through the Dáil without the input of the indepth report from the Fair Trade Commission.  That is a point that is worthy of a reply.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> of Thursday, 17 January 1991, has the obligatory notice from the Fair Trade Commission giving notice that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has requested the Fair Trade Commission to carry out a review of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.  I understand that that review is due in June or July.  Their point is, why such indecent haste?</P>
    <P>They argue that the fact that the review is under way is stifling any input they would have to make to the Bill.  They say it is critical to allow the FTC review to be completed so that the Bill can be informed by its findings.  The Minister must reply to this point and their disquiet <Col N="1547" /> about the fact that the Bill expressly takes up a position of not including a ban on below cost selling.  I do not recall the Minister dealing with that point in his speech.  I should like him to outline to the House why he has decided not to include any such measure, having regard to the fact that it is the view of this association that it has worked in the past and that the food trade is not capable of policing itself.  They point to the fact that it is impractical to think that suppliers will bring customers to court.  We have recent evidence of that point.  This is a very small marketplace and it is very unrealistic to expect a supplier to, say, one of the major multiples in the grocery trade, to cut off their nose to spite their face by bringing one of the big barons in the supermarket business to court.  I do not think this will happen.</P>
    <P>In addition, RGDATA in their briefing to me said there is no way, as they see it, that the Bill will be of any help to the small corner shop in Sixmilebridge who wants to take on the nearest Dunnes Stores.  It is simply not a struggle of equals and the small store concerned will not be able to avail of the remedies which are putatively set out in the Bill.  They claim that the livelihoods of some 81,000 persons are affected and say they have a right to be heard.  They gave data from the Central Statistics Office to spell out where those people are employed.  Those people are entitled to be heard and I should like to hear the Minister's comments on that point.</P>
    <P>They believe that section 6 &mdash; this is the only section to which I will refer &mdash; contains a number of flaws.  They say that suppliers and distributors will not institute proceedings against a major customer and that the sheer expense of legal remedy will nullify the positive benefits of legislation.  They say that the point for legal action should be clarified to avoid frivolous, vexatious claims and that the exact nature of judicial proceedings should be clarified.  They add that Irish courts should be able to recognise Commission decisions on the operation of Articles 85 and 86 &mdash; there is no <Col N="1548" /> case law here.  They also believe that the ministerial interventionist role in section 6 (4) seems misplaced and say that this role should be given to the competition Authority.  I have dealt with that point in some detail and I do not wish to return to it.  A number of those points are at least worthy of reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and every Member in the House, can fairly point to the competitive dimension enshrined in the Treaty of Rome.  It is only fair to put on the record of the House that that is, of course, tempered by Title III of the Treaty of Rome which deals with the social dimension of all of this.  I do not think we can forget the social dimension because the implications of removing all obstacles to competition in this economy, in so far as that is possible, means that there will inevitably be casualties.  I am not arguing for those casualties to be maintained in unproductive jobs but, obviously, on the one hand there will have to be a social welfare net as a safeguard and, on the other hand, proper training and retraining facilities while replacement jobs are found for people.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are dealing with a measure to create the proper legislative environment for competition to have full effect on the economy is obviously motivated by a wish to put the consumer at the heart of our considerations.  It is clear that the consumer has been getting a very bad deal in Ireland.  I am not clear on this aspect of the Bill and I should like the Minister to say exactly where the consumer fits into it.  I know what the Bill intends to do and, in a macro sense, the Minister is clearly a disciple of the belief that, once we remove competitive impediments, there will be growth, jobs will be created and that somehow the consumer will get the benefit.  Presumably he sees the market mechanism as mediating price more effectively.  I agree with him on that aspect but I fail to see what remedy is open to the consumer.  Surely it is not being suggested that the consumer, or any aggregation of consumers in any consumers' association, can invoke any of the measures enshrined in this Bill as remedies.  It is simply beyond the capacity <Col N="1549" /> of the consumer to avail of these mechanisms.</P>
    <P>It is not clear where the consumer enters the Minister's calculations.  I am not clear on how we are putting the welfare of the consumer at the heart of this legislation.  I do not think that is the way it will work and that is regrettable.  It seems clear &mdash; I say this for the want of giving the Minister something tangible to deal with &mdash; that the consumer has been getting a very bad deal in regard to the sale of liquid milk.  How, practically, does the Minister propose that enacting this legislation will deal with that problem? We heard the outcry when one supermarket sought to reduce the price of milk by 9p, from 54p to 45p, per litre.  The fact that a new company are seeking to involve themselves in the Dublin market, and giving out free milk and other inducements, seems to be evidence that they believe there is a profit margin here.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to an article on the price of milk by Raymond Crotty in the <i>Evening Press</i> of Friday, 26 April. Clearly this subject will not be popular with other Deputies who represent some of our largest and wealthiest farmers. Nonetheless, if we are seriously talking about the consumer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no farmers in Tallaght.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>You will be a long time waiting for a quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we talking about a milk quota or an electoral quota?  This appears to be an area where the consumer has been ripped off and I would like to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce specifically deal with it.  The Crotty article refers to 13,000 large farmers, each with 35 or more cows, who produce most of the milk, being among the wealthiest, highest income people in the land.  Mr. Crotty went on to talk about Avonmore withdrawing milk supplies because Dunnes Stores dropped the price and he referred back to the spate of creamery amalgamations that have taken place in recent years which is effectively <Col N="1550" /> giving five creameries control of nearly 80 per cent of the total milk market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, perhaps the Deputy would like to know that the gentleman he is quoting was a farmer and got out of farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a point of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a point of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  In trying to undermine the validity of his economic comment the Deputy cannot accuse Mr. Crotty of knowing nothing about farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>He is an economist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>He is an agricultural economist of some reputation and his point should be taken on board.  The article went on:</P>
      <P>Between 1984 and 1989, the price paid to Irish farmers for milk increased by over 22%, or nearly twice the 12% rise in the rest of the EEC.  When there was a world slump in dairy produce prices in 1990, the Irish creameries' hesitation in cutting the price of milk to producers caused them large losses &mdash; £6 million in the case of Avonmore.</P>
      <P>Caught by a diminishing throughput, between the hard ground of large liabilities and the stone of competition for declining milk supplies, the consolidate Irish creameries exercised their increased monopoly power to squeeze domestic consumers.  The Irish retail milk price was 2.51 times the farmgate price compared to an average of 2.23 times in the rest of the EEC in 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fair point and because so many consumers are affected it is a good tangible case to put to the Minister in terms of the practical application of his Bill. Can the consumer anticipate some improvement as a result of the enactment of this legislation?  Even for the Deputies <Col N="1551" /> who represent large farming constituencies it is a fair point.  Even the Deputies who represent large farming constitutencies would acknowledge&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Sherlock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;yes, like Deputy Sherlock, would acknowledge that criticisms that my party have been making, maybe too stridently in the past, of the function of the Common Agricultural Policy have some merit.  It seems to me that even the Minister's Tipperary colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, has come round to that view, and by the time Commissioner MacSharry is finished with him he will be a lot more convinced of it.  The market mechanism was not allowed to function and it was necessary to have Government intervention in order to keep up the price to the producer.  Otherwise, the consumer could have expected far more competitive prices during the years.  It was considered that in order to maintain prices to the producer that could not be done.  It is a reasonable question and I would like to hear the Minister address it.</P>
      <P>The Minister should say what impact this measure will have on Whitegate, for example.  The Minister has had controversy with the oil companies in the past and Whitegate, if my memory is right, was secured in the face of European regulations at the time.  They got a derogation from Articles 85 and 86 for reasons of national security.  Is Whitegate covered by this measure?  What is the Minister's prognostication for the impact of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is entirely facile to say that the reason we have a relatively dynamic thriving foreign sector is because the competition rules of the EC Treaty obtain for the foreign sector and the reason we have a relatively stagnant indigenous sector is because they are not subject to the same rules of competition.  There is a great deal more than that to it.  It is clear that where <Col N="1552" /> there are transnational companies able to dictate to national governments &mdash; and we have had examples with the oil companies &mdash; the appropriateness of Articles 85 and 86 is evident, but I question whether it is evident in all aspects of the domestic market.</P>
    <P>It compounds what is really tantamount to an insult to this House that this important Bill was published a couple of days ago simultaneously with a Fair Trade Commission's review of competition law which none of us has had time to study.  That is a great pity, because the Fair Trade Commission were asked, to put it simplistically, to look at the merits of introducing this prohibition system as compared to the control of abuse system.  In the report I just got from the Library they did that in considerable detail and argued the merits of one point of view as compared to another.  At least the Opposition spokespersons should have had an opportunity to study that report before being asked to respond in detail to this Bill.</P>
    <P>From a glance at the summary recommendations, it is clear that whereas the legislation is informed by the conclusions of this review, there are more than differences of nuance in what the Minister has eventually come up with and what is recommended by the Fair Trade Commission in a report for which I presume they had available the necessary expertise to conduct an analysis of what is a fairly complex dimension of industrial and economic policy.  I would point, for example, to the commission's recommendations in terms of the kind of body they envisaged being set up, which I would suggest on a cursory reading is nearer to the sort of executive independent authority I argued for, than this creature of the Minister which we are being asked to ratify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point last week that the Constitution is the basic law of the nation, a treaty or a concordat between the people.  As the basic law of the nation it should not be tinkered with. There was a time when Fine Gael were regarded as the great constitutional party of this House.  They regarded themselves as the self-appointed guardians of the Constitution and of the law but in recent years they have regarded the Constitution as a document which can be used in any way they judge to be expeditious in scoring a political point.  There is a great talent in that party and it is a tragedy that that talent is used for negative purposes.</P>
      <P>During the past few years Fine Gael have mindlessly proposed a whole series of constitutional amendments as an alternative to promoting real solutions to various problems.  Last week the Minister of State cited Arthur Schlesinger.  The quotation was very apt and it certainly applies in this case and in the case of the nine or ten other constitutional amendments which Fine Gael have proposed in recent years.  He said:</P>
      <P>Constitution-tinkering is a flight from the hard question, which is the search for a remedy.  Structure is an alibi for policy failure.  Let us not be beguiled by constitutional reform from the real tasks of State craft.  In the end, politics is the high and serious art of solving substantive problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody would deny that the issue of discrimination is a substantive and very serious problem.  Discrimination, in all <Col N="1554" /> its odious forms, is something to which people should address their ingenuity with a view to its termination.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, said last week, referenda are, by their very nature, clumsy instruments.  They are cumbersome and cannot deal with the fine detail which can be dealt with in statute law.  Neither can they handle nor should they be used as a means of dealing with issues which should be dealt with in statute law.</P>
    <P>The only occasion when we should consider using a constitutional referendum or amendment is when some serious and important consequences would flow from a change in the Constitution.  Alternatively, we should use constitutional referenda or amendments where it can be shown that necessary legal change is being hampered by some inflexibility within the Constitution.  In all the contributions made here last week nobody suggested that the simple change in wording proposed in the Bill was necessary either because a whole series of progressive measures would flow from it or because some provision in the Constitution was impeding any of the progressive measures that the proposers of the Bill would like to see put in place.</P>
    <P>As other speakers have pointed out, the proposal to change the Constitution does not push forward the cause of women's rights by one inch nor does the Bill facilitate any legislative reform which has been blocked by a constitutional stricture. The Bill, if enacted, and the referendum if it were to follow on, would achieve absolutely nothing of any consequence to women.  I read the speeches of Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Barnes in great detail.  Their contributions were as good as could be expected, given that they were dealing with something which was fundamentally flawed.  What was missing was any indication of what positive purpose would flow naturally from the Bill proposed.  At best, the Bill does no more than restate what is already in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Constitution a variety of rights are conferred on the citizen. Article 9.1.1º is interesting in that regard. <Col N="1555" /> That Article confirms the right of citizenship and states that &ldquo;any person who was a citizen of Saorstát Éireann immediately before the coming into operation of this Constitution shall become and be a citizen of Ireland.&rdquo; It goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The future acquisition and loss of Irish nationality and citizenship shall be determined in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>No person may be excluded from Irish nationality and citizenship by reason of the sex of such person.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Article 9.1.1º, on the issue of citizenship, already deals with the point which the Bill purports to address. That Article specifically indicates that nationality and citizenship cannot be denied to any person by reason of the sex of that person.  That is important because a series of other consequences flow from that Article.  Given that many other parts of the Constitution have been quoted, it is worth our while dwelling on Article 9.1.1º and 9.1.3º which for some reason was not referred to in any of the contributions made last week.  It follows from that Article that if no person can be excluded from nationality and citizenship by reason of gender no person can be denied or delimited in their enjoyment of the rights and the responsibilities of citizenship because of gender.</P>
    <P>While Article 9.1.3º has been largely ignored in the debate so far Article 40.1 has been referred to frequently.  Article 40.1 is very specific but it was dismissed rather lightly by Deputy Mitchell last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did refer to Article 9.1.3º.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Deputy referred to it and suggested that there were two cases which specifically prohibited discrimination.  It has been referred to in more than two cases but the Deputy is quite correct when he says that there were two fundamental cases. Article 40 states that &ldquo;all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&rdquo; That Article is fundamental to <Col N="1556" /> any discussion on personal rights.  That Article and the series of Articles which follow deal with the personal rights of the individual.  The first clause of this Article is central to all our rights as citizens and proclaims that we all, irrespective of gender, race, creed, denomination or even national origin, have rights.  Read in conjunction with Article 9.1.3º it should be clear that rights are enjoyed by all citizens, male and female.</P>
      <P>The second clause of Article 40.1 allows discrimination but such discrimination is, of necessity, positive and cannot, I would submit, either consciously or accidentally, be based purely on sex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his contribution supporting the Bill last week, Deputy Mitchell, while largely ignoring Article 9, though I accept he made some reference to it, was dismissive of Article 40.1.  He told us it has been relied on only twice to outlaw sex discrimination. If it were relevant I might quibble with Deputy Mitchell about the number of occasions on which this Article has been cited in regard to discrimination. However, I would regard the fact that it has been cited or relied on successfully as a basis for outlawing discrimination as being more relevant than the number of occasions on which the issue arose.  Once is a precedent, twice is a precedent established, and this Article has been relied on to strike down discrimination on the basis of sex on more than two occasions.  Deputy Mitchell made slight reference to the cases in which Article 40.1 has been cited as banning sex discrimination.  Whether this is a debating tactic or an oversight I do not know, but I know the findings of the High Court and the Supreme Court in the matter cannot be lightly brushed aside. The High Court in dealing with the Adoption Act, 1974 was very clear on the issue of discrimination.  This was a major finding which clearly set out and interpreted the rights of men and women in our Constitution. This Act sought, no doubt with some positive purpose in mind, to distinguish between the rights of men and the rights of women in the issue of adoption. The relevant case of O'Grady <i>versus</i><Col N="1557" /> the Attorney General made short shrift of discrimination and made it clear that sex discrimination was and remains repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>One section of the judgment is well worth recalling.  Dealing with the central provision of the Act, the court found the provision was and I quote: &ldquo;founded on an idea of difference in capacity between men and women which had no foundation and it was, therefore, an unwarranted denial of human equality and was repugnant to Article 40.1 of the Constitution&rdquo;. Why then is there a need to reinvent the wheel in this Bill?  The purpose suggested by Deputy Mitchell in introducing this Bill is good, but it is clear from that finding in that significant case that sex discrimination is already illegal and repugnant to our Constitution.</P>
    <P>In summary, in this case the court found that sex discrimination was a denial of human equality and as such repugnant to the first of the fundamental rights provisions of the basic law of this land.</P>
    <P>Does any Member of this House seriously believe that any court could lightly brush aside the crystal clarity of that judgment?  I do not think anybody could seriously argue that a judgment which is so clear cut could lightly be put aside.  If any law were to be introduced and passed here which clearly, specifically and intentionally &mdash; or even unintentionally &mdash; discriminated between men and women on the basis of sex alone, and if a counsel were to try to argue around that finding, she or he would come up against a second equally unequivocal judgment which I think was over-looked by Deputy Mitchell last week. That was the judgment in the De Burca case in 1976.  The Deputy may have mentioned it.</P>

      <P>Then I apologise, but if he mentioned the De Burca judgment he must accept that in the Supreme Court his issue was dealt with with even greater clarity then it was in the O'Grady case. The judgment which was handed down in 1976 is not open to any question at all. <Col N="1558" /> In this case the Supreme Court found, and I quote: &ldquo;...it is not open to the State to discriminate in its enactments between the persons who are subject to its laws solely upon the grounds of the sex of those persons.&rdquo; With respect, it could not become clearer.  That is precisely what was said in the De Burca case. I will send the Deputy a copy of the judgment and he can read it for himself.</P>
      <P>The least of the problems with this Bill is that it is otiose.  It reinvents the wheel. It is doing something that is already extant in law.  A more serious problem with the proposal is that it could produce a situation whereby it would, in fact, defeat its own stated purpose.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ferris made a very interesting contribution on this Bill.  He made the point about its dangers.  I will deal first with something similar which was dealt with by Deputy Vincent Brady, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, when he pointed to a number of items of slip-shod drafting in the Bill. This point is sometimes hurled from Government benches at the Opposition. I accept that Opposition Deputies have difficulty in regard to drafting because the whole area of parliamentary draftsmanship is something of a black art and its expertise is denied to mere common mortals.  Deputy Brady's contribution on this matter last week brought forward specific problems with the Bill, simple as it is in its presentation, which cannot but be referred to.</P>

Deputy Ferris describes the Bill as it stands as &ldquo;almost irrelevant to the task in hand.&rdquo; He went on at some length and pointed out that, worse still, the Bill is &ldquo;badly prepared and ill thought out and its consequences have not been considered.&rdquo; Amen to that.  He continued and again I quote: &ldquo;As a result the Bill could do some damage to the cause of equality if passed in its present form.&rdquo; In his conclusions he became even more trenchant.  He suggested that: &ldquo;As drafted this legislation is ill advised, it is badly thought out, incompetent and it may be dangerous.&rdquo; The judgment may be a little harsh but it is not entirely inaccurate.  It has to be said that, having described the Bill as ill advised, badly thought out, incompetent, dangerous and almost irrelevant to the task in hand, Deputy Ferris indicated he would consider supporting the Bill, but then consistency is never something which is required in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>All forms of discrimination are odious.  Discrimination on the basis of sex not only denies the individual the full dignity of his or her equality but it denies the State which is stupid enough to practise such discrimination access to at least half the human talent with which the State is endowed.  This is not a new thought.  Plato, not a person you would regard as liberal, argued in his <i>Republic</i><Col N="1560" /> that the whole pointlessness of sex discrimination was it denied the use to the State of half its talent.  Discrimination on the basis of creed is equally obnoxious, nor can discrimination on the grounds of colour, age or class be tolerated in any civilised society.  Discrimination on the basis of class, colour, creed, social standing or national origin is not specifically dealt with in the Constitution.  Why, therefore, did the proposers of this amendment not consider it worth their while expanding the proposition to deal with other types of discrimination not specifically mentioned in the Constitution? Fine Gael are not proposing amendments to Bunreacht na hÉireann on any of these areas.  The Opposition are not silent on these issues, I hope, because they condone such discrimination &mdash; I know that not to be the case.  They are silent in these areas because they know that such discrimination could not be tolerated by the Constitution as it stands.  In the same way Fine Gael know that any legislation deliberately setting out to discriminate on grounds of sex would be struck down, if not in this place then in the courts.</P>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Ferris who so brilliantly highlighted the deficiencies and consequences of following blindly along the lines proposed by this Bill, because this Bill is irrelevant to the task at hand, badly thought-out and ill-prepared and because, in Deputy Ferris's words, it is incompetent and might potentially be dangerous, I am opposing its passage.  I find nothing in this Bill to commend.</P>
      <P>The only way of addressing the vestigial discrimination which undoubtedly exists is by positive legislation.  We cannot deal with the type of problems we have, the types of problems women and various minorities have in our State, by way of referendum.  One must use one's ingenuity as a legislator to think up positive law to address discrimination.  I do not suggest that this set of proposals is a mere shibboleth but it comes close to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great pity that a party who have had a great tradition of defending the Constitution and in positive law should be reduced to proposing, on average <Col N="1561" /> every two months, a Bill to amend the Constitution.  That is no alternative to positive thinking and to bringing forward proper legislation.  This Bill is fundamentally flawed.  It will achieve no positive purpose, as the people proposing it know.  It does little other than serve some public relations objective and that is a great pity.  The Constitution of this State is more important than the short term political considerations of any politician or political party.  It is not something to be tinkered with lightly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been an ardent admirer of women from the days of my youth and looking across at the Minister I still remain an ardent admirer of ladies in various forms.  I have often been accused in recent years by women's organisations of being anti-women.  I wish to refute that.  I have traditional views for which I make no apology, particularly in regard to married women's duties to their children.  Women who embark on marriage as a profession or career have a duty to look after their children and provide a settled home for them until they reach the age when they can stand on their feet. That might be an old fashioned view but it is one which many people, including women, share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty supporting this Bill. While great strides have been achieved by women in recent years, there is a <Col N="1562" /> long way to go in their fight before real equality is fully achieved.  There are many areas of Irish life where women are discriminated against, especially the area of family law.  Three years ago the High Court decreed that, in the case of marriage break-up, house ownership was settled on a 50-50 basis.  A recent decision in the High Court by Mr. Justice Bannon has thrown a spanner in the works.  He decreed that, while women have a percentage interest, they no longer have an equal right.  That must be addressed if equality is to be achieved in that sector.</P>
    <P>In the recent rape Bill the concept of marital rape was alluded to but not recognised. A decision in the House of Lords two weeks ago recognised that marital rape is a crime.  We have to do some homework to equal the score in relation to legislation across the water.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon:</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have equality. There is a definite imbalance in the Diplomatic Corps and the Judiciary where there is a bias against women which should be addressed.  In the private sector corporate echelons do not reflect the input many capable women have made in business in the years since the fifties.</P>
      <P>Another area which can be seen as a male bastion is the education sector where principals of all types of schools, including convent schools, are almost without exception male.  Women teachers fill the lower paid posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most glaring example of inequality is to be found in the public sector.  Figures given by Deputy Gay Mitchell point to an overwhelming bias against women. Among the 16 Department Secretaries there is not a woman, while there is only one woman among 99 Assistant Secretaries. I accept that part of the bias is historical, dating back to the early seventies when women had no option but to leave employment.  It was Fine Gael who addressed that problem and corrected it. Since 1973 there seems to have been a bias by various Governments, and I indict my own.  Surely there are many capable <Col N="1563" /> ladies in the public service who deserve a push up the ladder.  These unacceptable figures belie any claim by the Fianna Fáil Government that women are to be treated equally.  An immediate elimination of this hypocrisy is called for if Fianna Fáil are genuinely to be seen to be interested in the welfare of women. Women should be paid equally.  If they are sufficiently competent to undertake any given job then there is no cause for paying their male counterpart more for doing the same simply because he is a man.</P>
    <P>I might pay tribute to the women Members of my party, in particular Deputies Barnes and Fennell.  I would include also Deputy Taylor-Quinn, &mdash; but the first mentioned were in the vanguard of the fight for women's rights over the years.  The Minister of State present very often has been in agreement with their demands.  Those two women Members of my party have imprinted their names on the minds of the public as being chiefly responsible for the great improvement wrought in women's conditions in recent years.</P>
    <P>I do not always applaud my party. Indeed some years ago I was regarded as a malcontent, criticising them on various issues.  But Fine Gael can take a bow on having embraced the cause of women, on having involved so many women Members in politics, on having introduced so many women Members to this House.  I know the Minister of State has been to the fore also within her party in espousing the cause of women, but somehow, Fianna Fáil have failed to capture the public image of being genuinely interested in equality for women.</P>
    <P>I do not often differ from my women colleagues.  I am sure eyes were raised in alarm when I came into the House for fear of what I might say.  I believe that, when the fight for equality for women has been won, Fine Gael will be seen to have been the party to have been most genuine in advancing the cause of women's rights generally.</P>

      <P>I should first compliment my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, on having undertaken the necessary research, drafting and presentation of this Bill.  In so doing he has addressed a fundamental problem.  Much legislation has been processed through this House over the years to redress various inequalities in different sectors, whether that be in the labour, family home or other areas.  The fundamental problem lies within our Constitution.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed at Deputy Roche's contribution here this evening. It became very clear to me that he does not understand its superiority or the way our Constitution supersedes all legislation passed by these Houses or indeed any case law decided by our courts.  The Constitution is the final legal document protecting the interests of our people. Finally, everything rests on the Constitution, whether it be legislation going through these Houses or case law determined in our courts.</P>
      <P>In introducing this Bill, Deputy Gay Mitchell has addressed the central issue of the real problem that is within the Constitution.  Over the years we have reacted, in particular since 1973, to EC Directives.  Were it not for some of those directives much legislation would not have been processed in this House.  That, coupled with the work undertaken by the Council for the Status of Women and various women's organisations &mdash; who over the years exerted pressure on successive Governments &mdash; has resulted in much legislation being introduced in this House.</P>
      <P>We should be aware of the fact that the United Nations established a committee to examine the whole question of discrimination against and equality for women.  In Article 2 of their report they recommended that all member states should ensure, in their Constitutions &mdash; be they written or otherwise &mdash; that any such discrimination obtaining is redressed or eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> Deputy Gay Mitchell, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, has taken a major stride forward, as has been the record of Fine Gael in the past.  Over the years Fine Gael have been the one party in this House that adopted a very progressive approach to equality legislation, reform and the overall position of the role of women in Irish society.  They have been to the forefront on that issue.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that once again we are taking another forward step.  Unfortunately, Deputy Roche did not appreciate that fact.  He attempted to denigrate the Fine Gael attempt in introducing this Bill to the House as being a cheap publicity stunt.  On the part of somebody who appears to be so learned, who reads into the record of this House so many pieces of academic knowledge, it is amazing Deputy Roche is not aware of the basic fact, which is the superiority of the Constitution <i>vis-à-vis</i> all legislation passed in any form.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Roche is not present in order to give him that basic lesson in legal education, something of which most people are aware.  In attempting to denigrate the Bill Deputy Roche has demonstrated a regressive type of attitude.  Indeed, some of his colleagues on the far side of the House, in particular the Minister of State present &mdash; with whom I worked on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights for five years &mdash; must have been somewhat taken aback at some of the regressive ideas he presented to the House this evening.  I do not think some views he expounded would have had the full support of some of his colleagues, which is unfortunate. Indeed, he would appear to advocate less progress than, say, the founder of his party, Eamon de Valera, who at various stages attempted to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche argued this evening that referenda are clumsy instruments that cannot deal with fundamental issues that properly should be dealt with by way of statutory law.  That is an appalling statement on the part of any Member of this House.  All public representatives should recognise the value of referenda.  The <Col N="1566" /> difficulty here is that we have not had sufficient referenda; they have not been a feature of our political life.  One need only examine the position in other countries, in particular Switzerland, where referenda are held on various issues every few months, they being a common feature of political life there.</P>
    <P>It is important that we view referenda as being part of the political process, as fundamental to a good political democratic process rather than be fearful of them.  In discussing referenda this evening Deputy Roche lectured us on this side of the House on our experience <i>vis-à-vis</i> referenda in the past, advising us that we should be fearful of them.  That is most unfortunate.  I would appeal to the Government parties to adopt a different attitude.  Referenda are good and the people always should have their say.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if enacted, would present the people with an opportunity to register their views on Article 41 of the Constitution which clearly discriminates against women.  That Article states that women have a particular position within Irish society, that being very much within the home &mdash; referring specifically to the home, the family, the woman, the mother.  At no time is the man or the father referred to in the Constitution. Rather the Constitution talks about the duties of the woman, of the mother in the home.  One could say that the woman in the home who does not happen to be a mother is discriminated against also. There is serious discrimination in this Article.</P>
    <P>The political climate is now right for the House to examine this issue and recognise that the women of Ireland and, indeed, many of the men, are anxious that the discrimination should discontinue. We will have a very real political opportunity on local election day on 27 June to present the people with a referendum.  It would not cost the State any extra money because an election is being held on that date.  It would be an ideal time to put this issue to our people.</P>
    <P>I hope the other parties in the House will see the wisdom of the proposal by Deputy Gay Mitchell.  It is specific and <Col N="1567" /> positive, one that deserves support.  It is supported by the various women's organisations. When the womens group of the Irish Council of Civil Liberties sought to redress this aspect of the Constitution they made a recommendation that an equal rights clause be inserted into Article 40.  Their reason for making that submission was that they believed that such a clause would provide a legal definition of equality which at present is not in the Constitution.  Article 40 does not state clearly that discrimination on the basis of sex is prohibited.  It is important this matter be addressed.  Groups such as the Irish Council of Civil Liberties do not make recommendations without having them thoroughly examined and fully analysed and we should recognise that fact.  What is being proposed is not dramatic or radical; it is something that is now required in a society progressing into the nineties and moving on to the next century.</P>
    <P>As members of the European Community, we have an obligation to eliminate from our Constitution any discriminatory clauses.  Only last week the Second Commission on the Status of Women, established by the Taoiseach last November, produced an extensive list of recommendations. It is amazing that, despite all the talk we have had for the past 20 years in relation to equality for women in Irish society, so many inequalities exist. One of the recommendations of the Commission was that legislation should be introduced immediately giving each spouse equal rights of automatic beneficial ownership of the family home and household chattels.  That is a very important recommendation because, as the House is aware, the position in law is that the purchase price of the house and the amount contributed by either spouse is taken into consideration and allowance is not made for the work a woman does in the house or the contribution she has made over the years, even the financial contribution.  Our thoughts will have to move from financial contributions to real contributions in the type of work done and the effort made to rear a family, <Col N="1568" /> manage a household and an income. Under our family law no consideration is given to that contribution.  That recommendation was made no later than last week yet Government speakers strongly oppose the recommendations put forward by Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals put forward was that national lottery and other public funds should not be allocated to private clubs that operate discriminatory policies against women.  All Members are aware of the clubs throughout the country, private and not too private, that operate definite discriminatory policies against women, yet successive Government Departments allocate public funds to them.  It is time the Government, and each Department, laid down conditions that any club which actively discriminates against women or any group should not receive public moneys.  That should be a fundamental principle of all Government Departments and every Member should support it.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that taxpayers are paying money into the Exchequer to have allocated to clubs that operate discriminatory policies.  I hope the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who is present will actively pursue that matter with the Taoiseach and the Government because it is despicable.  I note that in the past she supported this thinking.  I listened to Deputy Roche and was appalled at some of the comments he made but I was consoled to see the Minister of State present knowing that she had different thoughts and was somewhat more progressive than Deputy Roche.</P>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women recommended that the Government should appoint a fifth member to the top level appointments committee.  I am sure the Minister will respond to that recommendation because it should be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell, in the course of his contribution, outlined much of the case law against women and where the Constitution had not protected the rights of women.  Those cases are now on record. Deputy Roche attempted to confuse the <Col N="1569" /> issue and I suggest he misquoted and misrepresented the record of the House in what Deputy Mitchell said last week.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious problems in relation to discrimination against women is the attitude that exists.  There is an attitude among the public in general that is so basic that it will have to be addressed.  The Department of Education can do much to redress that inequality.  Attempts have been made over the past five or six years to change the style of text books so that men and women are not put into particular role models.  There is still within our society an attitude &mdash; and, perhaps, Deputy McGahon reflected it partly in what he said in relation to women &mdash; that once women have children they should be there to rear them until they get on their feet.  Deputy McGahon forgot to refer to the fact that there is also a father.  He did not appear to believe the father had any obligation to be at home until the child got on his or her feet.  That view reflects the thinking of many males in Ireland. To get those males to come out of their cosy condition and state of mind will require a dose of shock treatment.  It is about time the legislators gave them the shock treatment.  Nothing would be better than to present them with a referendum which would challenge their beliefs.  People may say they espouse equality but when you scratch the surface you might find they are not very sincere in what they say and that fundamentally they believe equality is grand at a distance but they do not want to bring it too close to home.  It might be no harm to give people the opportunity to reflect on their attitudes and perhaps call a halt to hypocrisy on the role of women.</P>
    <P>It is commonly said that the woman's place is in the home and I am sure every lady Member of this House, all 13 of us, has been asked at different times if it would not be fitter for us to be at home. That attitude still prevails and there will have to be a great deal of work done to change that attitude.  Young children, despite what they are being taught at home, will have very definite attitudes on what A and B should be doing once the <Col N="1570" /> forces of society come into play.  This problem will have to be addressed through the educational system first and then through legislation in this House and a referendum.</P>
    <P>The 1986 census showed that we had a population of 3.54 million, of which over 50 per cent were women.  It is timely that women be given an opportunity of registering their voice on the issue of equality and registering their vote at the most fundamental level, which is the Constitution.  It is unfortunate that some Members do not recognise the superior position of our Constitution over all other legislation.  This is the real place to address the issue of equality and having addressed the issue in the Constitution, all other legislation would have to abide by the Constitution, as amended.  Deputy Mitchell's amendment is highly commendable. He must be commended for the progressive attitude he has taken on this issue and on the research and work he has done.  I ask the other Members to fully support this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to this debate last week and I have been listening to it tonight.  The main benefit of this Bill in Private Members' time is that it has led to this Dáil focusing on the question of equality of opportunity for women.  We needed that debate in the Dáil and for that reason I welcome the very good debate we have had and are having in this House.  I do not agree with Deputy Mitchell's specific proposal to amend <Col N="1571" /> Article 40 of the Constitution; in fact I cannot understand why he has used the Constitution to raise some very valid aspects relating to equal rights for women.  Article 40.1 as it stands recognises the rights of women.  I know this has been said before but I think it warrants repeating; Article 41.1 states:</P>
      <P>All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
      <P>You do not have to be a constitutional expert to understand that the term &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; includes men and women.  This is a basic fact and it has to be repeated.</P>
      <P>It is not prudent to tamper with our Constitution in an erratic manner.  As one spokesperson for the Labour Party said last week, to do so &ldquo;could do some damage to the cause of equality&rdquo;.  Nevertheless, very real and pressing issues of equality have been raised during the debate and I would like to deal with some of them.  Women's rights should be the concern of both men and women.  This is the case for most men in this country.  It is true in the case of the male Members, including myself, who are on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  This committee are currently dealing with issues referred to by Deputy Taylor-Quinn, and with discrimination against women in clubs, including golf clubs.  I certainly agree with her sentiments on that issue and I hope that matter will be resolved.</P>
      <P>The two most important aspects of this debate are society's attitude to women and equality of opportunity for women and men.  As I understand it, women want to see a levelling of the playing field: they want fair play.  They do not want favours or positive discrimination.  They deserve equal status, an opportunity to work, to get to the top of profession, a company, a trade union or a political party on merit.  That is the way it should be.</P>
      <P>The role of women in the home and the rearing of children have been referred to during the debate and many speakers have referred to Article 41.2.2º:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" /> The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, rearing children is a shared responsibility between mothers and fathers in most families.  This Article of our Constitution is, to say the least, a little dated and I am surprised Deputy Mitchell did not focus his attention on it. We have focused more on Article 41 than on Article 40 in this debate.  Whereas I recognise the legitimate motives of those who formulated Article 41 to protect the security of the child and the desirability of the mother being with a child in the home, Irish society is now so different from that which existed 54 years ago that this Article has little meaning today. For economic reasons in many cases, both father and mother must now go out to work.  Professional child-minders, nannies and crèche facilities are part and parcel of modern Ireland.  Both the father and mother have duties in the home.</P>
    <P>There are many single parents who deserve and get State support to rear their children and get suitable accommodation. I do not think they would pay much heed to somebody telling them not to neglect their duties in the home.  They simply want to get on with providing a warm, comfortable home for themselves and their children and deserve the State support they get to achieve this.  I have no doubt that many TDs in the course of constituency work have come across deserted fathers: I have come across quite a few.  A Constitution which refers only to the mother; as the one who stays at home to look after the children does not have much relevance for those fathers.  Responsibility for the care of children does not fall just on the shoulders of the mother.  In the vast majority of cases it is seen as a shared responsibility between the father and the mother, and the State and our Constitution should recognise this.</P>
    <P>The State currently recognises the right of the mother to take 14 weeks' maternity leave.  This is to be welcomed but I <Col N="1573" /> believed we should endeavour to extend the period of maternity leave.  There are very many financial pressures on young married couples and on first time parents to return to the workplace shortly after the birth of a child.  I appreciate there will be financial implications but I feel strongly that we should aim in the years ahead to ensure that there is financial compensation for women who want to take a lengthy break from the workplace in such circumstances.  We should also endeavour to introduce paternity leave after the birth of a child.  For example, if the mother had to return to work shortly after a child's birth, why should the father, if he so wishes, not take parental leave from work to care for the child.</P>
    <P>It would be an interesting exercise to look at this issue in other EC countries. In Germany, they allow eight weeks post-natal maternity leave, but 12 weeks are allowed in cases of multiple births and during this time the mother is in receipt of her full earnings and the employer is required to supplement State benefit. Either parent may take 18 months' parental leave, and there is a cash allowance for the unemployed.  In addition, each parent is entitled to take five days paid leave to care for a sick child under eight years of age.  In France, ten weeks post-natal maternity leave is allowed.  Parental leave is available until a child reaches three years of age and may be taken full or part-time.  The time can be shared between parents so that both mother and father may work part-time.  However, this leave is unpaid unless there are three or more children where a flat rate benefit is paid.</P>
    <P>In Italy, three months post-natal maternity leave is available and benefit equivalent to 80 per cent of earnings is paid.  A period of six months parental leave may be taken during a child's first year.  Leave is granted to the mother but she may cede this right to the father.  During the period parents receive State benefit equivalent to 30 per cent of earnings.  Some women in the public sector get higher payments due to collective agreements they make. Women workers, but not men, may take <Col N="1574" /> unpaid leave to care for a sick child under three years of age.</P>
    <P>In the Netherlands maternity leave has recently been extended to 16 weeks, but there is no parental leave.  A scheme has been approved by the Parliament but has not yet been introduced.  It would give each parent the right to six months reduced hours &mdash; 20 hours a week &mdash; which could be claimed at any time until the child is four years old.  This individual right to part-time leave could not be transferred from one parent to another, and the leave would be unpaid.  In Belgium maternity leave lasts for 14 weeks and there is no statutory parental leave.  However, workers can take six to 12 months leave from employment &mdash; called <i>interruption de la carrière professionelle</i>&mdash; for family or personal reasons.  A low flat rate benefit is paid. In Luxembourg eight weeks post-natal maternity leave is available and women receive benefit equivalent to 100 per cent of earnings.  Fathers are entitled to two days paid leave.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom 29 weeks post-natal maternity leave is available.  There is a length of service condition and to qualify women must have worked with the same employer for at least two years full-time or five years part-time.  This excludes a large number of women. There is no paternity leave and no leave to care for sick children.  In Denmark 14 weeks post-natal maternity leave and two weeks paternity leave is available.  In addition parents may take up to ten weeks parental leave.  During this period parents receive benefit equivalent to 90 per cent of earnings.  In Greece maternity leave lasts for 14 weeks.  There is statutory parental leave of three months for each parent and six months for a lone parent.  This leave is unpaid.  Parents are entitled to unpaid leave to care for a sick child under 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>In Portugal maternity leave lasts for 90 days, and benefit is equivalent to 100 per cent of earnings.  In addition, parents may take up to 24 months unpaid parental leave but the take-up is reported to be low. Paid leave to care for sick children is available to government employees and <Col N="1575" /> lone parents earning below a certain limit.  In Spain maternity leave lasts for 16 weeks.  There is a period of 12 months unpaid parental leave.  Parents are entitled to take unpaid leave for the first two days of a child's illness.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, in Ireland women receive 14 weeks maternity leave. Women in the public service receive full pay.  There is no maternity leave, parental leave or leave to care for sick children. Many employers, however, grant two days discretionary leave to fathers on the birth of a child.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> underpins the Government's commitment to bring about equality and equal opportunity.  I await with interest the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  I hope they will examine closely the questions of maternity leave, paternity leave and parental leave and come up with practical recommendations. There are some enlightened, progressive and imaginative measures in place in other EC countries, as I have just pointed out, and we should take the better elements from these proposals. Of course there is a cost factor, and the question must be asked as to who will pay for this and what proportion will be paid by the State, the parents and the employer.</P>
    <P>Let us look at this area in the interest of equality for women and good child care services.  Recent figures showing a substantial fall in the Irish fertility rate suggest that the cost may not be as high as might appear.  Even though we had the second highest fertility rate in Europe in 1985, second to Turkey, the figure dropped from 3.23 in 1980 to 2.49 in 1985.  This compares with 3.97 in 1985 for Turkey.  At the lower end of the table the figure for the Federal Republic of Germany in 1985 was 1.28.  That shows quite a discrepancy.  A further fall in the fertility rate will have major implications for our ability to pay for legislation in this area, but I expect harmonisation within the EC.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, will be <Col N="1576" /> very aware of what is happening at that level.  It will also have implications for our ability to provide crèche and child-minding services as referred to in the new programme.  The potential for support from the European Community is being examined by the Minister for Labour.  I hope that Community assistance will be available for the provision of crèche facilities, in particular in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to attitudes to equal rights.  Many of our attitudes are formed and developed during the early years in schools.  I welcome the advances made in our educational system in promoting equality for boys and girls, men and women.  The current Minister for Education has shown a specific interest in promoting this matter.  However there is still much to be done with the school curriculum to ensure that the boy and girl sitting in the classroom feel that they are equals.  That does mean that Mammy has to be shown going out the door to work being kissed goodbye by Daddy who is wearing his apron, and handing Mammy her sandwiches.</P>

      <P>In the old days Daddy went out to work and Mammy was at home wearing her apron and waving goodbye.  I do not suggest that we reverse the roles.  What is required is equal treatment. For example, I understand there is a departmental recommendation in relation to the teaching of singing in primary schools, that girls should be taught to sing soft, gentle songs and boys should be taught to sing lively, upbeat songs.  I do not believe that teachers take much notice of such advice.  In fact in a mixed classroom it would be virtually impossible to implement such a measure.  These <Col N="1577" /> aspects of our curriculum must be taken out once and for all.  I would have to put on record my strong belief that the vast majority of teachers, male and female, with mixed classes are promoting very actively the concept of equality in the classroom, but the system under which they operate must also recognise this concept.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made during the debate to the FÁS schemes and I would encourage those operating the schemes to ensure that women get their fair share of the opportunities.  I would have had much more respect for Deputy Mitchell if he came in here with a motion in relation to the kind of issues I have raised. As I said at the outset, they are very legitimate issues.  Politics is about getting things done, finding solutions and taking action.  Successive Governments in the last 25 years have taken action.  The Fianna Fáil Party have contributed substantially in introducing the Succession Act, legislation on equality in the workplace and in the tax system, free legal aid and so on.  Since 1987 we have had the introduction of the Judicial Separation Act which was initiated by Deputy Shatter, my constituency colleague, reform of the rape laws and legislation to protect part-time workers, the majority of whom are women.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fennell in her contribution last week gave the impression, in a very strong attack on Fianna Fáil, that all these measures were due to the efforts of the Fianna Gael Party.  I appreciate that there was quite a contribution from that party but I had thought that in the last few years we had all reached a new level of political maturity in this House that rejects old-style partisan attacks of that nature.  The reality is that legislation is not introduced unless the Government party decide at Cabinet level to do so and the necessary numbers are there to walk through the lobby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us collectively take the best proposals from the many positive issues that have been referred to during this debate. In co-operation with the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the Office of the Minister of State at the <Col N="1578" /> Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, who since her election to the Dáil has been constantly to the forefront in promoting equality for women and currently co-ordinates Government legislation in this area, we should get down to building on the progressive steps that have been undertaken by this Government and bring about real equality for women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us in this House would agree, perhaps some more begrudgingly than others, that over the past 25 years the changes in attitudes towards equality for women have indeed been encouraging.  The Council for the Status of Women in the seventies set out the agenda for the change which took place during that period.  Two milestones were reached during that time, the end of the ban on married women in the Civil Service and the payment of maternity leave, two issues which we now take for granted but which were innovative in the seventies.  Much legislation has been passed in this House to improve the lot of women over the last number of years and I am glad that the most up-to-date change was that in the budget with regard to part-time workers, because 80 per cent of those helped under legislation are women.  However, although the changes are laudatory, much work remains to be done and this House needs to bring about practical change that will help women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I talk about practical change, the one thing that immediately comes to mind is the question of child care facilities. I know this was mentioned many times during this debate but, with your indulgence, I will mention it again because not only career women who actively choose to work but also women who work out of economic necessity &mdash; who have to work to supplement their husbands' wages &mdash; find it very hard to get facilities for child care or indeed to pay for them.  Perhaps women who are in a position to earn a good wage could be given tax concessions to help them to pay for child facilities; for those not in a position to pay &mdash; and the option must be available to career women as well &mdash;<Col N="1579" /> the answer to the problem is to initiate State-run crèches.  The importance of this is that it gives an option to all women to have standardisation of facilities and care for their children.  They can go to work knowing that their children are well looked after and cared for in the way they would like.  This, of course, would facilitate many more women going to work or at least give them the option of doing so.  It is a proposal put forward by many organisations on behalf of women, not least by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and the Employment Equality Agency.  It is interesting to quote Sylvia Meehan on the submission from the Employment Equality Agency to the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  She said:</P>
    <P>The principal barrier to equality in paid employment is the failure by Government and employers to acknowledge workers as parents.  The absence of initiatives in the paid labour markets to facilitate the combination of family and paid worker responsibility means that parents are impeded in their careers and, because women have traditionally discharged the bulk of family responsibility, it is their paid working lives that are most affected.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency called in their submission to the Second Commission on the Status of Women to ensure that they would be supported in calling for crèche facilities.</P>
    <P>In referring to the Employment Equality Agency I should like to refer to some other aspects of their submission because they are extremely useful to women and have a very practical application. One is the mandatory requirement that employers should establish codes of practice on sexual harassment in every workplace; another one is the maximum age limits for employment entry to be abolished and, of course, the extension of equality legislation to outlaw sex discrimination in education.  I am glad to note that the summary of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, which has just <Col N="1580" /> been published, includes many of the proposals put forward by the Employment Equality Agency.  One is the whole question of crèches and the commission call for the Government, through the Minister for Education, to direct the National Council for Curriculum Assessment to review preliminary curriculum handbooks as a priority with a view to eliminating all sexism and sex stereotyping.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Tom Kitt said, we all know the importance of education, particularly in regard to younger members in our schools as it affects their outlook for their whole life.  Indeed, as a psychologist, I know the difficulty which arises from the whole question of sex stereotyping but I am sure the Government will do all they possibly can to try to eradicate that type of sex stereotyping from our midst.  I know the Minister for Education has already been working on this; her work has been effective and acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The age barrier to recruitment in the public service was also mentioned in the commission's submissions and recommendations. There is no need for such barriers and I support this commission in looking for that to be deleted.  One of the very interesting recommendations from the Council for the Status of Women was that legislation should be introduced immediately, giving each spouse equal rights of automatic beneficial ownership in the family home and household chattels. Lawyers in this House will understand that the situation at present is not cut and dried in favour of women as perhaps some people would like to think. The position should be closely looked at and monitored and we hope there will be progress in legislation in this respect to look after women.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation of the commission is that every memorandum for Government should set out the probable impact on women of proposed policy change.  This, of course, would be very useful because it would act as a watchdog for women.  Indeed, I honestly believe this work is done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights; they certainly act as a watchdog when they see certain legislation going through and act <Col N="1581" /> upon it in this House through their spokespersons for the different parties.</P>
    <P>I must admit I have some difficulty with the third recommendation of the commission which says that in the current lifetime of the board women should be appointed to all casual vacancies in State-sponsored bodies to be filled by direct Government appointment unless there are objective criteria for appointing a man.  I quite understand that positive discrimination is seen to redress the balance as it were, to try to give opportunity and that little bit of extra help to women who have not got it up to now.  However, we cannot on the one hand talk about equal treatment and, on the other, about preferential treatment.  I accept that the motive behind this is laudable in that they want to put women forward but I am not quite so sure of the methods they propose.</P>
    <P>I support other Deputies in saying that national lottery and public funds should not be allocated to clubs which operate discriminatory policies, that is something with which most, if not all, Members of this House would agree.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the comments made by Deputy Taylor-Quinn.  I found it difficult to follow her argument because, in many respects, it was contradictory. This debate is to review the recommendations which the Opposition put forward in regard to Article 40. That Article, repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> through this debate, says that all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.  I do not think any extra amendments or additions can be put to that; it clearly states what it means, that there is equality for all citizens, male and female.  That certainly is my reading of it.  I am not a constitutional lawyer but any advances made based on our Constitution have been made through the courts.  Certainly it seems that the courts have supported the Constitution time and time again in expressing the rights of women, indeed putting much pressure on the legislative bodies, through this House and the Upper House, to bring about changes in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> There has been much reference to Article 41.  That is irrelevant to this debate because what we are interested in relative to this proposal is Article 40.</P>
    <P>I am always a little disconcerted when people refer to Article 41.2.1º which deals with women's place in the home. There are, perhaps, different ways of looking at that.  Some might say that that actually states that the woman's place is in the home.  I take a broader interpretation of that &mdash; and this has been done by our courts &mdash; by saying that we are trying to give recognition to the very valuable work done by women in the home.  If a woman chooses to stay at home to be with her family she should not be seen as secondary to the woman who chooses a career outside the home. The Constitution seeks to protect the woman who freely chooses to stay at home to look after the children.</P>
    <P>I found Deputy Taylor-Quinn's statement that there was no protection in law for women who stay at home to be contradictory. The protection is, obviously, there in the most supreme law we have in this land, namely, the Constitution.  If any changes need to be made &mdash; and certainly many changes are needed to help the position of women, those who stay at home and those who work outside the home &mdash; they are the responsibility of this House, the Upper House, and the frame work for that is set down in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Rather than looking for changes in our Constitution and trying to pass the buck, it would be more useful for Members here and in the Seanad to take the initiative and put forward practical proposals for consideration.  I am sure such proposals would be given a very sympathetic hearing by the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tom Kitt referred to the importance of parental leave and paternal leave.  These issues are accepted within European law.  As a Member of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1984 I took part in many discussions at committee level and within the European Parliament on these issues.  That could be pursued by our Minister of State.  I would <Col N="1583" /> be interested to hear her comments on that issue.</P>
    <P>Supporting this proposal put forward by Fine Gael would not achieve anything positive for women.  I would prefer to see how we could have some practical influence.  Very often EC institutions and our courts have put pressure on the Legislature to bring about change.  It is time to initiate that change ourselves.  We should do that not by trying to rewrite the Constitution that lays out the framework but by putting our own house in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this very important Bill introduced by my colleague Deputy Gay Mitchell.  I compliment Deputy Mitchell on bringing forward this well thought out Bill to amend the Constitution to include equality clauses for men and women.</P>
      <P>The source of women's rights in Ireland is the Constitution and it should make it clear that men and women have equal rights.  By that we mean political, social and economic rights.  Our attitude to women was instilled in us as children when, coming home from school or play, we expected our mothers to be in the house.  It was not that we felt she should be there as a right but we were happy to see her there.  That was the attitude from the foundation of the State right up to the last decade when women felt they should be more outgoing and play what they felt was a more important part in the activities of the country.  However, I believe they played a very important part and, if nothing else, I would like in my contribution to pay tribute to the women of Ireland, to the mothers who reared families, who stayed at home and reared the people who made Ireland the great country it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not deny that in this country in the thirties, forties and into the late fifties women had a hard life.  In rural Ireland they were the hewers of wood, the drawers of water and the providers of meals. They lived through hard times rearing large families in houses with very basic facilities, little equipment to cook with or <Col N="1584" /> do the washing.  However, the families they turned out were a credit to them. Meals were provided at little cost.  In rural Ireland when a farmer and his neighbours helping him returned from the fields his wife would have a substantial meal on the table provided out of ingredients grown in the garden.  They were happy times although they were very hard times.</P>
    <P>Farmers would not have managed if the woman of the house had not helped them in rearing the calves, the chickens and the turkeys, what are now called alternative enterprises.  The woman of the house earned money by supplying turkeys at Christmas, chickens during the summer and eggs to be sold at the local market.  Vegetables were grown by the wife.  The farm scene has changed dramatically and there is still a role for the wife or, in many cases, a brother and sister who for one reason or another work on a farm.  However, there has been no recognition of the work of the woman on the farm from the foundation of the State to 1991, and I have not heard any contributor mention that fact.  She is not entitled to social welfare allowances; she is a non-entity as far as the State is concerned and that is something that should be looked at.  As farms get bigger the wife plays an even more important role learning to work modern machinery and, in many cases, driving a tractor and combine harvester.  Some city women might think this is terrible but modern equipment is as easy to drive as a modern car and women are quite happy to do so.  In many cases women own their own farms and are doing an excellent job.</P>
    <P>For that reason alone I welcome Deputy Mitchell's Bill but it has broader implications.  Young couples trying to provide themselves with a home feel that there must be two wage earners.  I can appreciate that but it is a whole different scene now.  There are implications for the role of the mother and her influence on the family.  If a wife is working outside the home certainly she cannot be as relaxed when she comes home as the mother who works in the house although she might be doing as much and often heavier work. <Col N="1585" /> However, the woman in the home is not under the same pressure as the mother driving a distance to work, organising her home before she leaves in the morning and trying to make arrangements to come home in the afternoon.  Recognition must be given to the role played by such women in maintaining homes with their husbands in these circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this very urgent and important matter on the Adjournment so that it can be clarified by the Minister.  This matter relates to farmers who ceased milk production in the late seventies and early eighties under the non-marketing of milk scheme and the dairy herds conversion scheme.  Those farmers ceased milk production with the intention of building up suckler herds, which they considered to be an easier way of life and they received suckler grants for doing this.</P>
      <P>When the Mulder case was considered by the European Court it was decided that farmers who had ceased milk production under the non-marketing of milk scheme and the dairy herds conversion scheme were entitled to a quota after the 1983 quota year and they were awarded such quotas.  In October 1989 the Department of Agriculture and Food issued a document to co-operatives informing them that a large number of Irish farmers were entitled to a quota under the Mulder quota scheme.  They were advised, and I quote:</P>
      <P>(a)  the quota may not be surrendered under a cessation or restructuring scheme nor may it be offered for lease under a scheme for the temporary leasing of quotas,</P>
      <P>(b)  (i) in the event of the sale or lease of the supplier's holding the quota allocation shall revert to the Community Reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1586" /> The next three clauses are not relevant. I want to refer to the last paragraph which is relevant to the case I am making here. It states:</P>
    <P>As indicated above the quotas are being allocated provisionally at this stage.  In order to have his/her quota allocated definitively each supplier must have recommended milk deliveries from his/her holding by 29 March 1990 at the latest and must, in a continuous twelve month period between 30 March 1988 and 29 March 1991, have delivered at least 80% of the quota provisionally allocated.  If these requirements are not met the quota shall be returned to the Community Reserve.</P>
    <P>This is where the problem arises.  The farmers to whom I have referred were notified by the Department of Agriculture and Food, that under an EC Directive, they would have to return the suckler cow grants they received in 1989 if they did not supply milk.  The amount of milk they had to supply was not specified &mdash; it could range from one gallon to 1,000 gallons.  In many cases farmers supplied ten, 15 or 20 gallons on the advice of their co-ops, who were acting on the instructions of the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>In order to meet the requirements set out in the EC directive and to keep their Mulder quota alive, they had to supply a certain amount of milk.  The amount of milk involved is minimal.  They supplied this milk in the national and local interests &mdash; they wanted to hold the quota in this country.  It is unfair that these farmers are now being penalised for having met that requirement.  There was no way a farmer could know in October 1989 what quota he would have been entitled to in January.  He had built up a suckler her and only supplied the milk so that this important quota would be retained in the country and he is now being penalised for doing this.  I ask the Minister to change this regulation which is unfair and unjust.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the EC Regulations governing the suckler cow premium schemes between 1980 and 1989 an applicant had to undertake not to engage in commercial milk production for 12 months after the date of lodgement of his or her application. Any 1989 suckler cow scheme applicant, therefore, who had applied after the opening date of 15 June 1989 for accepting applications would have given an undertaking not to engage in commercial milk production for 12 months from his or her date of application.</P>
      <P>Under Council Regulation 764/89 governing the allocation of Mulder milk quotas applicants for such quotas were enabled to receive provisional quotas within three months from 29 March 1989 if they fulfilled the criteria governing allocation of those quotas.  Under Commission Regulation 1033/89, however, any person who received such a provisional quota was obliged to show by 29 March 1991 that he or she had resumed commercial milk production for at least 12 months before that date.  This meant that he or she had to resume such production by 29 March 1990 at the very latest.</P>
      <P>The net effect of these two regulations was that a successful applicant for Mulder quota had to resume commercial milk production some time between 30 March 1989 and 29 March 1990 and had to have at least 12 months of such continuous production starting from some date between those two dates.  Unfortunately, however, regardless of when such commercial milk production began between those two dates, this meant that an applicant under the 1989 suckler scheme would have broken the undertaking given by him or her not to engage in commercial milk production from his or her date of application.  In such circumstances under the rules of the 1989 suckler cow scheme, the Department of Agriculture and Food would have had no choice but to recover any suckler cow premium paid to the applicant concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not seem to me that this is an anomaly at all.  Basically it is a matter of <Col N="1588" /> the 1989 suckler cow scheme applicant making a choice between the benefits of that scheme and the benefits of acquiring a Mulder milk quota.  Every other milk producer in the country was excluded from benefit of the 1989 suckler cow scheme where he or she was found to not to have complied with the undertaking not to produce milk commercially.  There seems no reason at all, therefore, for the exclusion of recipients of Mulder milk quotas from such a penalty.  It may be argued, of course, that such recipients may have large start-up costs for their new dairy enterprises and that some flexibility should be shown under the suckler cow scheme regulations.  Regretfully, however, we have no discretion under the EC Regulations governing that scheme to show such flexibility and as a result the Mulder quota recipients must be treated in exactly the same way as all other milk producers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening.  I should also like to thank the Minister for being present.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should like to thank the Minister for not allowing planting to take place in the beautiful Lake Isle of Inish-free in County Sligo.  The Minister made this decision after visiting the area and seeing it at first hand.  The Ox Mountains, one of our beauty spots, has a scenic route leading to a place known as the Lady's Brae in County Sligo.  Sligo County Council provided a viewing area there so that people could enjoy Lough Gill, Sligo Bay, Donegal Bay, Strandhill, Rosses Point and other beauty spots in County Sligo.  Unfortunately, some years ago the forestry department planted trees in that area which obstructed the view from that place.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that these trees which are not fully developed are cut to enable people to view this lovely part of County Sligo, known locally as the valley of the black pig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to planting too near houses, <Col N="1589" /> I recently received a letter from a constituent on this topic.  The man had purchased a house in October 1990 with the intention of making it his home for many years.  He had invested all his savings in the property and had taken out a mortgage.  He had chosen the house because of its scenic position with a view of the Ox Mountains at the rear and a view of the countryside to the front.  He was concerned to hear that the Department intended to plant trees around the house and that, if this happened, in a few years time they would obstruct the view of the Ox Mountains and the surrounding areas.  On foot of that letter I wrote to the chief executive of Coillte Teoranta. Unfortunately ploughing has been done there and trees will soon be planted. There are advantages in forestry in relation to employment and so on but I am concerned about indiscriminate planting too near houses.  Some people are living in fear of trees being planted too near their homes.  I hope the Minister will make sure that indiscriminate planting will not happen.</P>
    <P>Planning permission for all types of planting should be mandatory.  The Minister for the Environment should introduce legislation to ensure that there must be planning permission, particularly in scenic areas, to plant trees.  If I wanted to build a house in a scenic area I would find it very difficult to get planning permission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that I was here to respond to the matter of the inconvenience being caused to many people by forestry planting too near their homes.  The Deputy seems to be referring solely to planting which may block out a scenic view, which is a completely different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been concerned that anybody might be inconvenienced by forestry planting too near their homes and I have been watching this situation and had discussions about it with officials in my Department.  I welcome the opportunity being presented by Deputy Brennan to discuss the issue.  While I do not accept that widespread inconvenience is being caused about that issue, I recognise that <Col N="1590" /> some concern has been expressed.  Where such concern can arise, in practice it is taken into account locally by the forestry inspector in consultation with the developer and local interests, before a planting programme is recommended.  It is, of course, increasingly appreciated by all developers that afforestation must be undertaken with minimum adverse consequences for the widest definition of the environment and indeed that such projects should enhance the environment.</P>
    <P>This specific question of planting close to housing is one that has been examined in particular.  It has long been recognised that trees close to buildings require special attention.  Indeed, such trees are exempt from the restrictions on tree felling imposed as long ago as 1946.</P>
    <P>I have taken account of the fact that plantations which are too close to houses can reasonably be seen as visually obstrusive and under certain circumstances they can be a hazard while also increasing occupants' sense of isolation. In order to ensure that forest development does not impose unreasonable burdens on occupants of such dwellings. I have decided that grant assistance for private forestry developments will not be available for planting within a distance of 30 metres from dwelling houses and asociated buildings.  As with other environmental requirements, Coillte Teoranta will be expected to adhere to this policy in their planting programme.</P>
    <P>While this is a general condition, each case is considered on its merits and there may be a case for limiting the planting further in specific cases.  We already have instances where the planting line has been revised on the inspecting officer's advice to take account of community concerns.</P>
    <P>The decision to disallow grants for planting within a distance of 30 metres from dwelling houses and associated buildings is a significant development and one which will reassure those with concerns about being isolated by trees.  My concern here is with occupants of buildings and I would not expect that such restrictions would be required in the case of unoccupied buildings or roadways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> Before February 1990, planning permission under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts was not required for any forestry developments. The position has changed, however, and planning permission is now required for afforestation in excess of 200 hectares.  This arises as a result of the transposition into Irish law of the EC Directive, 85/337/EEC, on Environmental Impact Assessment.  This requirement will ensure that all major forestry developments will be subject to detailed scrutiny by the local planning authority who will, I am sure, take account of the proximity to housing.</P>
    <P>While there are environmental concerns about afforestation which must be and are taken into account in promoting increased planting in this country, there are also many compelling environmental reasons for encouraging such development. There is, for instance, growing alarm internationally about the effects of tropical deforestation and the consequences of the greenhouse effect.  The expansion of forests in Ireland can make its contribution to maintaining the total world area under forest and hence to counteracting the greenhouse effect.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware that there is a need to maintain a balance in all forestry programmes so that the judicious development of forestry can make a positive contribution to the environment and to the provision of recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>Approval of grant aid through which planting is encouraged in dependent, <i>inter alia,</i> on all reasonable steps being taken to avoid adverse effects on the environment. These steps include a prior assessment system for proposed forestry developments and monitoring of successful applications to ensure compliance with the approval given.  Thus, any application for grant aid may only be approved subject to their meeting Forest Service standards as to their environmental compatibility, impact on historical and cultural heritage and the type and standard of silviculture and general workmanship.</P>
    <P>Approval of grant aid may only be <Col N="1592" /> given within the limits imposed by EC and national legislation as well as the above considerations, prior to the commencement of work.  For instance, schemes likely to have negative impacts on such features as boglands listed for conservation by the Wildlife Service as internationally or nationally important, areas of outstanding natural beauty, sites of recognised historical, cultural or natural value, including sensitive fisheries areas, will be identified as such and account taken of these concerns.</P>
    <P>I would like, therefore, to assure the Deputy that I am aware of the matter which I understood he would raise here. I have taken action to avoid inconvenience to people by my decision to disallow grants for planting within 30 metres of dwellings and associated buildings. All cases are examined and dealt with on their merits and more stringent conditions and constraints may be imposed where necessary.  I am confident that from now on complaints will be few, if any.  I had hoped to hear some specific details of cases tonight.  If Deputy Brennan gives me the details of the one case he mentioned where he considers the planting proposed is too close to a dwelling. I will be happy to examine it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the conditions in which children at the Central Model School, Marlborough Street, Dublin 1, are being educated.  I should say at the outset that I am particularly disappointed that the Minister is not present in the House to reply because she has been personally involved in this case and has a direct and special responsibility to the school. However, I am sure she has other business to attend to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For almost nine years this school has been accommodated in prefabricated buildings, ironically in the grounds of the Department of Education a few yards from the Minister's own offices.  I am sure the Minister would accept that she has a <Col N="1593" /> direct and special responsibility to the school since, by tradition, she is the patron and, effectively, the manager of the school, thus the term &ldquo;model school.&rdquo; It follows therefore that the conditions the children and teachers have to endure must be a cause of considerable embarrassment to her and her Department.</P>
    <P>Most of the prefabricated buildings have been in place since the school building was badly damaged by fire almost nine years ago and they are deteriorating at an alarming rate.  They constantly let in the rain with the result that there is severe dampness.  This must surely be a concern about the children's health.  The roofs are patched constantly but by now they must be beyond their useful life span.  Their unattractive, shabby and decrepit appearance is an insult to the teachers, children and their parents who have during the years shown great allegiance to and support for the school despite these deplorable conditions.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 250 children accommodated in these prefabricated buildings.  Amazingly, pupil numbers this year are the best in almost a decade and all the indications are that these high numbers will be maintained despite the dramatic decline in other schools in the city.  In part, this is a tribute to the dedicated staff and proud parents who have persevered during the years.  Indeed, the Minister has met many of the parents and staff and is well aware of their concern and commitment.  There have been several meetings with the Minister, one of which I and other Deputies for the area attended.  Each meeting brings new hope but regrettably and, inevitably, this is followed rapidly by new disappointments. The culmination of several meetings with the Minister was a written commitment of sorts which was sent to the parents' committee and their Dáil representatives.  I have a copy of that letter in front of me which is dated 25 May 1990 and it was signed by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke.  It contains the following information:</P>
    <P>I am pleased to tell you that I have now decided that the planning for the <Col N="1594" /> building project for the Model School, Marlborough Street, will now proceed. I know you will be pleased with this news.</P>
    <P>I was pleased with the news but that was a year ago and precious little has happened since.  I now feel that I was misled by the Minister.  Since then the board of management have been shown what was for them a second set of plans in 18 months for the same school building but there still has been no news of tenders being invited or of a commencement date.  Surely, the parents and staff have a right to know how long more their children will have to endure shabby, unhealthy and unacceptable conditions in the grounds of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>This was and is one of the most popular schools in what has for long been regarded as an educationally disadvantaged area, the north inner city. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> stated that particular attention must be paid to children suffering educational and social disadvantage.  The programme gave a commitment that resources would be targeted to assist the disadvantaged in availing of the various educational and training services.  It specifically committed itself at primary level.</P>
    <P>The recent study commissioned by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul confirmed the north inner city to be the most disadvantaged community in the Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>When will this area be targeted to receive resources?  Adjacent to the Central Model School there is a very large derelict site where there was a sign stating &ldquo;Reserved for North Inner City Community College&rdquo;.  It was put up ten years ago and the site is still lying derelict.  Where does this leave the children of the north inner city?  Is it any wonder that the area has massive <Col N="1595" /> social problems?  May I, finally, ask the Minister of State to tell us when the Model School will be rebuilt: this year or next?  Will he be blunt and state if he wants to kill the school because official neglect and disinterest is slowing strangling it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline my intentions in relation to the reconstruction and refurbishment of the Model Schools premises at Deverill Place.  The Deputy has outlined the history of these schools but it would be useful to go back over some of the details.</P>
      <P>May I first respond to his criticism that the Minister is not present by apologising for her absence.  The Minister is in County Carlow tonight fulfilling a prior commitment.</P>
      <P>These schools, junior and senior English speaking, have an enrolment of 242 pupils and a staff of two principals plus ten assistants including a remedial teacher and a number of concessionary posts.  The schools have of necessity been accommodated in prefabricated classrooms for a number of years.  A fire severely damaged the Deverill Place building in 1982.  Last year the entire accommodation for the junior school was destroyed in a fire which necessitated the provision of new prefabricated classrooms.  I fully accept that it is unsatisfactory that a school should be accommodated in prefabricated buildings for a long time.  I am of course very familiar with the day to day problems of the school as I have had a number of meetings with the school authorities.  I should also say that the Minister has had several meetings, as the Deputy pointed out, with the school authorities and teachers and has had ongoing discussions with the parents' representatives.  Naturally, both the Minister and I have knowledge of the condition of the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, approval has been given for the reconstruction and refurbishment of the Deverill Place building as a permanent facility for both <Col N="1596" /> schools.  It is my intention that the building works be put in hands at the earliest possible date.  I fully accept that the architectural planning and associated technicalities have taken longer than we genuinely anticipated but this a complex job involving a building dating from the last century with special features and stonework.  It has been necessary to engage experts to ensure that the school is restored to the highest architectural traditions and standards.</P>
    <P>The latest position on the planning is that the detailed drawings, both structural and architectual, are well advanced and discussions are at present taking place with a quantity surveyor in private practice who is putting his bills of quantities into place.  I am fully aware of the concerns of all involved with the school that the building works be commenced as a matter of urgency.  I will ensure therefore that the remaining tender documents will be completed with the minimum delay.  The Deputy will appreciate the importance of ensuring that these documents are fully in order in every detail having regard to the historical, educational and cultural importance of the project and the capital cost involved.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns of Deputy Gregory who has been in touch with the Department about the matter and who has raised it in the Dáil on a number of occasions.  We are aware of his interest in getting the project off the ground. I should also say that the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, has constantly been in touch with both the Minister and I to try to secure progress in the school, as indeed has Deputy Stafford.</P>
    <P>When the tender documents have been completed the matter will be given the most urgent attention.  The Minister will communicate with the school authorities and all other interested parties at that point to indicate the final stages of the completion of planning and commencement of construction.</P>

I propose to call the Deputies I have selected in the following order: firstly, Deputy Deenihan in respect of two matters and, secondly, Deputy Finucane in respect of one matter.

      <P>The present refrigeration programme being undertaken by Kerry Co-operative will cost Kerry dairy farmers upwards of £10 million.  In County Kerry over 60 per cent of farms are less than 50 acres in size.  There are 5,300 suppliers to Kerry Co-operative, 70 per cent of whom have quotas of less than 20,000 gallons.  The milk price reduction to Kerry suppliers at the peak 1989 levels is now standing at 17p per gallon.  This drop in price has knocked £3,400 off the income of a 20,000 gallon Kerry dairy farmer.</P>
      <P>The refrigeration requirement for products in the 8,000 to 20,000 gallon category, as outlined in what I am saying here tonight, will cost dairy farmers almost 6p per gallon per annum for five years.  This combination of falling milk prices and the extra cost involved as a result of refrigeration places a huge financial burden on smaller producers which will undoubtedly force many of them out of business.  The number of milk suppliers in Kerry has fallen from 7,000 in 1980 to 5,300 at present.  Unless grant aid is made available many more farmers will be forced out of milk production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made several appeals to the Minister to have grant aid made available last year and this year.  The IFA exerted pressure through the Department of Agriculture and Food and also in Brussels to have <Col N="1598" /> money made available from the coresponsibility levy to grant aid the purchase of milk cooling equipment.  During the period 1978-86 EC grant aid for the purchase of on-farm milk cooling equipment was funded from the co-responsibility levy.  Ireland benefited to the tune of £7.3 million.  However, in 1986 the Commission took a decision to have the scheme discontinued as they felt they had allocated sufficient funds over the years for on-farm cooling equipment.  A submission was made by the Department for funding for refrigeration from the co-responsibility levy in the 1991-92 milk year.</P>
    <P>The only way I can see the Department making money available is through savings made from other areas.  I appeal to the Minister that if savings are made in the pollution control area he will apply them to the cost of refrigeration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter.  I have a personal interest in it and I will be as helpful as possible.</P>
      <P>As part of the 1992 Single Market programme, the EC Commission has submitted proposals to harmonise standards for health and hygiene both in relation to liquid milk for human consumption and to milk for the manufacture of dairy products. While these are only draft proposals which are being technically examined at present prior to their submission to the Council of Ministers, there is no doubt that in whatever final form the proposals are eventually agreed they will involve significent investment, particularly at farm level, to ensure compliance with the Common Agricultural Policy.  In that context, of the significant investment, farmers should be supported financially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, has already raised with the Commission the question of allocating Community funds to assist with the adaptations necessary to meet with the proposed regulations.  In addition, an <Col N="1599" /> industry working group composed of representatives of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the farmers' organisations has been established to examine the implications of the Commission's proposals and to formulate a detailed submission that would be used in pursuit of our request for Community aid.  The working group have already held two meetings and they have been requested to complete their work as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Our approach to the negotiations on these measures will be to ensure that whatever standards of milk quality are agreed are reasonable having regard to all the circumstances.  In the meantime, I can assure the House that the provision of Community funding in this area is a priority matter for us and we will be pursuing this issue as vigorously as possible with the Commission and hope for a positive outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the income supplement promised to farmers will be paid in cases where disease breakdown results in the removal of more than 10 per cent of animals in a herd but where depopulation is not deemed appropriate. Payment is in respect of each animal removed, as a reactor, from herds in which there are 100 animals or fewer on the date of restriction and will be at the rate of £25 per month for suckler cows and £15 per month for dairy cows and other animals.  Feeder cows and other animals in feed lots do not qualify for these grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment over 185 herds are locked up in Kerry and this is a source of considerable hardship to many farmers. I suggest that the income supplement scheme be introduced as soon as possible. It should apply to all herd owners, maybe with a modulated payment for those farmers with over 100 animals.  I am sure the Minister will agree that herds are locked up and restricted for too long. Herds should be derestricted as soon as possible so that farmers can pursue their <Col N="1600" /> normal farming activities.  A sum of £4 million has been allocated under the ERAD budget specifically to fund farmers who have suffered financial hardship because of extended restriction.</P>
    <P>When will this money be given to farmers? Can the Minister tell us tonight? Will payment be made retrospective to January 1991?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the practical difficulties which can arise when a TB outbreak is confirmed on a farm. First, the herdowner is required to remove the reactor to a designated meat plant.  ERAD provide a free reactor collection service and the herdowner's reactor animals are transported at no charge to the herdowner.  The meat plant pays the herdowner directly for the value of his animals as reactor carcases.  In addition, ERAD pay a reactor grant in respect of each reactor animal to an amount depending on the type of animal.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the ERAD grant is designed to bridge the difference between the slaughter price and the cost of an equivalent animal.  Grant levels are reviewed on a regular basis to take account of market trends and prices.</P>
      <P>An independent study carried out recently by Professor Seamus Sheehy of University College, Dublin, concluded that the present grant system was, in broad terms, fair in its application. Having removed the reactors, the herdowner is faced with a period of restriction during which animals can be moved into or out of the holding on a permit basis only.  To take account of the financial pressure which may arise as a result of restriction, income supplement is paid by ERAD to qualifying herdowners in respect of each full month of the period during which the herd is restricted because of bovine TB, including any period of extended restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the director of ERAD that the ERAD Board are currently reviewing the income supplement mechanism with a view to making certain modifications primarily designed to channel the supplement towards herdowners undergoing real financial hardship.  I am <Col N="1601" /> awaiting the outcome of this review and my expectation and hope is that a better system will be devised to meet the situation.</P>

      <P>It is over six months since the IDA got the mandate for industrial development for overseas industries for the mid-west region but over a period of time there were two projects which were very much in the news in Newcastle West.  I refer to the Bartizan project and the Gogi project.  In a previous ministerial response which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, gave at the time the impression I got was that the Bartizan project had disappeared into the sunset and was no longer destined for Newcastle West and that the Gogi project was under considerable doubt.  The people of Newcastle West have become a little cynical about industrial promises at this stage.  I can fully understand and appreciate their cynicism.  We have two advance factories in Newcastle West of about 18,000 square feet which have been refurbished at a cost of £350,000 to make them aesthetically pleasing to industrialists.</P>
      <P>There is a feeling of disappointment in the Newcastle West area and I want reassurance from the Minister that something positive is being done.  The declining number of industrialists coming into the area are concentrating their activities in urban areas, particularly Limerick city and the Plassey area.  I suppose this is understandable in view of the third-level educational establishments there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to see Newcastle West and other areas of the county deprived and denuded of industry.  The Minister might indicate that something positive is happening and that efforts are being made to attract some industrialists to the Newcastle West area.  Industry would be very desirable in the area.  I compliment <Col N="1602" /> Abbeyfeale on its success in relation to the Kostal project and the expansion which is taking place.  With a Minister of State in west Limerick, there is a feeling of disappointment that nothing is happening in Newcastle West.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 November last the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated to the Deputy that grant assistance had previously been approved for projects by both Bartizan Corporation and Gogi Brothers Knitwear by Shannon Development.</P>
      <P>In the case of Bartizan, Shannon Development have had further discussions with the company since then in relation to establishing an operation in the Shannon region.  I understand that at one stage the company were looking at the possibility of establishing a distribution type operation in the Shannon free zone.  However, due to pressure on distribution space in the zone, Shannon Development encouraged the company to consider Newcastle West as their first choice location.  The company have yet to finalise their decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>In the case of Gogi, the company were approved a grant aid package in December 1989 for a project which was to start up in 1990 in Newcastle West.  However due to delays in sourcing production equipment from East Germany and the need to firm up on market outlets in some European countries, the promoters decided to delay the project.</P>
      <P>I understand that the last formal notification received from them was to the effect that they were delaying start up of the project until February-March of this year.  Since then they have not responded to requests for a revised start-up date.  I understand from Shannon Development that the company's reservation on one of the units at Newcastle West has now been cancelled and that the building is, accordingly, now available for promotion to new overseas companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as site visits to the units on the industrial estate are concerned, this is, essentially, a day-to-day matter for the <Col N="1603" /> industrial development agencies involved, namely, SFADCo and the IDA.  I am satisfied that the arrangements agreed by the two agencies for encouraging possible industrialists to visit the region are satisfactory and are working well.  I have no doubt that they are doing <Col N="1604" /> everything possible at present to ensure the establishment of new industry and the development of existing industry in and around Newcastle West.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 1 May 1991.</P>

The previous scheme, which was introduced under the Turf Development Act, 1981, and terminated in 1987, served the purpose of stimulating the development of private peat resources very successfully, to the extent that private production now amounts to some 1.5 million tonnes annually.</P>
      <P>At a time when there is a continued need for discipline in the public finances, I do not think that it would be appropriate to dedicate further Exchequer funding to this purpose.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>Soft drinks are among the wide range of consumer goods and services which have benefited from the reduction of 2 percentage points in the standard VAT rate implemented in each of the last two budgets.  In addition, the rate of excise duty on table waters was cut by 20 per cent in the 1990 budget.  It now stands at 29p a gallon or 3.625p a pint as compared with excise duty of 37.6p on a pint of beer of average alcoholic strength.  When account is then taken of VAT, the tax-based differential amounts to 41p per pint.  I consider that this favourable tax treatment should facilitate the charging of substantially lower prices for table waters by publicans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to add that my colleagues, the Ministers for Health and Justice, are also concerned about the issue of alcoholism among young people.  The Deputy is probably aware that the Minister for Health set out details of the steps being taken to deal with the problem very recently in the House Official Report 26 February 1991, Cols. 1528&mdash;1531 refers. The Minister for Justice would have me point out that the Intoxicating Liquor <Col N="1416" /> Act, 1988, introduced a wide range of controls within which the problem of under-age drinking is being tackled.  In this regard I would refer the Deputy to that Minister's reply to recent questions in the House, Official Report 6 March 1991, cols. 83-87.</P>

      <P>I understand that this question refers to Members of the Oireachtas who had between five and eight years' service and who ceased to hold office before 1 September 1983.  Under the terms of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pension Scheme, such members may opt for (a) a refund of the contributions paid by them under the scheme, or (b) spouses' and children's pension entitlements, based on 8 year's service.</P>
      <P>In the case of Members with between five and eight years' service who leave office on or after 1 September 1983, the scheme provides for an additional benefit, <i>viz</i> preserved pension at the rate of 1/40th of salary per year of service, which is payable from age 60, or earlier in cases of permanent incapacity.</P>
      <P>I regret that it would not be possible for me to approve an amendment of the scheme so as to extend the preserved pension benefit to the former Members referred to by the Deputy.  Such an amendment would give rise to repercussive claims on behalf of public servants who left office before the introduction of preserved benefits throughout the public service generally, resulting in very substantial extra costs for the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that an application for a tax clearance certificate was received in the Collector-General's office from the taxpayers in question on 29 January 1990. The application was refused by the Collector-General on 6 February 1990 because of arrears of tax owed by one of the taxpayers involved.  A further application for a tax clearance certificate was received in the Collector-General's office from the same taxpayer on 15 February 1991.  This application was refused by the Collector-General on 19 February 1991. While the taxpayer in question paid £5,000 in respect of his income tax liabilities, arrears of VAT and PAYE remain outstanding in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have <Col N="1419" /> advised me that they will issue a tax clearance certificate in this case as soon as the tax affairs of the applicant are brought completely up to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of measures are in place, both nationally and internationally to conserve migratory birds.</P>
      <P>The Wildlife Act, 1976, protects all wild birds throughout the State.</P>
      <P>The EC Directive on the conservation of wild birds, No. 409 of 1979, establishes a system of general protection for all wild birds throughout the member states of the European Community.  This directive is implemented in Ireland under the provisions of the Wildlife Act.</P>
      <P>The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, known as the Bonn Convention, and established in response to a United Nations Resolution, was ratified by Ireland in 1983.  The aim of the convention is to protect endangered or threatened species of fauna which migrate between different states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of prime importance in the maintenance of populations of migratory wild birds is the preservation of their habitats. The overall objective is to create a network of national parks, nature reserves, refuges for fauna and wild fowl sanctuaries which is representative of all habitat types.  A number of these have already been established and progress continues. <Col N="1427" /> The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance as Waterfowl Habitat, known as the Ramsar Convention, was ratified by Ireland in 1984.</P>
    <P>Hunting of migratory game species is reviewed each year with regard to the conservation of that species by means of the open seasons order made under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  If scientific evidence suggests that a particular game species is under threat it will be removed from the open season list.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that comprehensive efforts are being made to conserve migratory species in Ireland.</P>

      <P>This application was received in my Department in July 1990 and was considered for inclusion in an <Col N="1430" /> operational programme which was then being prepared for submission to the EC Commission in the following September. However, because of the limited FEOGA funding available it was not possible to accommodate the application in that programme.</P>
      <P>Under EC Regulation 866/90 a project is ineligible for FEOGA aid if work on it commences more than six months before the date on which the Commission receives the operational programme containing the aid application.  In this particular case work on the project had already commenced when the application was submitted to my Department in July last.  Therefore, as officers of my Department have already explained to the applicant, this application is now ineligible for inclusion in any future operational programmes.</P>
      <P>However, the applicant was also informed that there were some elements in his application which might constitute a separate project and which, on that basis and subject to compliance with the start of work requirements outlined above, might still be eligible for aid.  He has recently submitted a fresh application in respect of those elements.  Subject to assessment of the relative merits of this and other applications with regard to the limited availability of FEOGA funding, the application will be considered for inclusion in the next operational programme to be submitted to the Commission in July.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to (1) the dramatic rise in the level of the Shannon at Athlone from February to March 1991, (2) the Clonbunny level of flooding in the Golden Island and areas south of Athlone and (3) the hardship to farmers who have no dry land on which to graze cattle where winter feed is gone and with no prospects for a silage crop this year; and if he will outline the measures he proposes to take to help the farming community in this area.</Quest>

      <P>The information available to me suggests very little loss of fodder or crops.  As regards the areas referred to by the Deputy, I understand that the levels reached this year were not exceptional and that these levels have since fallen back.  There is no evidence of severe or widespread financial loss due to flooding and, in the circumstances, I do not propose to introduce an aid scheme this year.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on an ERAD report that Cork veterinary surgeons have spotted only half the number of TB infected cattle as their Department of Agriculture and Food counterparts and that in the ERAD report, which was carried out between March 1990 and January 1991, private veterinary surgeons found only 3.41 reactors for every 1,000 animals tested while Department veterinary surgeons found 4.27 reactors per 1,000 animals; and if he will outline the action he proposes to take on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy):</NameTxt>
      <P>ERAD's quality control strategy as applied to the 1990 testing programme indicated a potentially greater number of TB reactors than that recorded for the total national testing programme.  Therefore, it is concluded that a number of reactor cattle are not being detected with the present testing regime.</P>
      <P>The quality control results also showed a regional or county variation.  The main factor giving rise to the variation appears to relate to the nature and regional distribution of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commitment to provide some £30 million for a three year TB eradication programme has recently been received from the European Community.  The Commission has attached a number of conditions to drawdown of the funding. These include changes in the arrangements for the allocation of testing, and <Col N="1432" /> negotiations are in progress with the Irish Veterinary Union on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The operation of the beef carcase classification scheme is determined by Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1208/81 and Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 563/82, which are implemented in Ireland under the European Communities (Beef Carcase Classification) Regulations 1982 (S.I. No. 382 of 1982).  Carcase classification in Ireland is undertaken by officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food who have been trained fully for this task.  Their work is closely monitored to ensure that the highest possible degree of accuracy in gradings is being applied in accordance with EC Regulations and also to ensure that an even standard is maintained throughout the country.</P>
      <P>As an additional measure to protect the interests of producers, an appeals system operates.</P>
      <P>In 1990 the total kill in Irish export plants was 1.359 million head.  Of these 21,194 &mdash; 1.6 per cent &mdash; were appealed. The number of successful appeals at 5,097 represents 0.4 per cent of the overall kill.  I consider that these data show a satisfactory degree of accuracy in classification.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Energy</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline (1) the procedure for notifying the public, especially the public affected by the licences, in advance of the issuance of mining licences and (2) the means available to the public for lodging objections to licence applications.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>State mining leases-licences are granted under section 5 of the Minerals Development Act, 1940, which applies to minerals which are State owned and section 18 of the 1979 Minerals Development Act which relates to minerals in which there is a private interest.  Where I am considering a lease or licence application under the 1979 Act, I am required to publish in at least one national daily newspaper and in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> for two consecutive weeks, notice of my intention to exercise my powers under the Act. I am also required, as far as is practicable, to notify by registered post my intention to each person who appears to have an estate or interest in the minerals for which the lease is being granted.  It is <Col N="1437" /> also the practice to place notices in the relevant local newspapers.</P>
      <P>The notice indicates the manner and time within which an answer, objection or other communication, if any, arising out of the notice is to be made and the address to which such communications are to be sent.  I may refer any representations received for consideration by the Mining Board and I am required to do so in the event of any person making such a request in the prescribed time and manner.  The Mining Board are obliged to hold an inquiry and report to me on their findings.  Copies of the board's report are also made available on request to each person who made representations.</P>
      <P>There are no similar publication requirements or objection procedures for leases issued under section 5 of the 1940 Act nor has it been the practice of previous Ministers for Energy to advertise their intention to grant such leases.  It is, however, my policy to ensure that adequate opportunity be given for the lodging of objections to such lease applications.</P>
      <P>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that even after a lease-licence has been granted by me under either Act, full local authority planning permission must be obtained and all of the associated notification and objection procedures complied with before mining can actually commence. The planning process is, in fact, the major forum in which the public make an input into decisions related to mining.</P>

      <P>A proposal to extend the gas grid westward from the Dublin/Dundalk pipeline is at present under consideration.  Neither myself nor the Minister for Finance has yet given formal approval to the project which would be built this year and completed early in 1992.</P>
      <P>The project, which is estimated to cost about £10 million, will be eligible for funding from the European Commission's Special Border Areas Programme. A formal response is expected shortly from the Commission to an application for funding under the programme.</P>
      <P>The proposal would involve building a pipeline from Skibbolmore in County Louth, to Mullagh in County Cavan, with spur lines to Bailieborough and Virginia. It is based on a limited number of specific industrial and commercial customers with whom Bord Gáis Éireann have held discussions, and who have agreed to take gas, when the pipeline is built.  The possibility of supplying domestic users will be considered if and when viable markets can be identified in the areas concerned.</P>

      <P>At present a total of 143 gardai are assigned to the Bridewell station.  The number assigned to foot patrol varies from time to time according to other demands, but three to four gardai are usually assigned to foot patrol duty in the area at any one time.</P>
      <P>The number of gardai assigned to individual stations is not fixed and the Garda authorities adjust station strength on an on-going basis having regard to available resources, local circumstances and other demands on Garda services.  The Garda authorities inform me that the current overall strength assigned to the Bridewell station is the maximum that can be provided there at present but that the situation is being kept under continuing review.</P>

This sum supports headquarters administrative staff and a testing corps of 79 testers, eight supervisory testers and one chief supervisor.  This team of testers, which is almost twice the number operating this time last year, includes 19 temporary testers recruited specially to eliminate the backlog of test applications.  I see no need to increase that number.</P>

      <P>In carrying out the assessment of long term road development needs which underpins the road development measures contained in the operational programme on peripherality, my Department used the following average <Col N="1453" /> construction costs (1988 prices) for projects on national roads where more detailed estimates were not available: Single Carriageway Roads &mdash; £1 million per km; Dual Carriageway Roads&mdash; £2 million per km; Motorways &mdash; £3.0 million per km.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the unit costs for these works depend on a number of factors i.e. topography, type of soil, the number of structures (bridges, underpasses) involved.

      <P>The following are current estimated costs of the other types of road works mentioned:</P>

      <P>I am informed by the registrar-general that where births are not registered within one year of the date of their occurrence they can be registered only on his authority after certain legal requirements are met.  The person in question, whose birth had not been registered within the required period of one year, contacted the general register office in 1989.  It transpired at that stage that the applicant had difficulty in procuring the necessary documentary evidence to enable registration to proceed in the manner which he desired.  The application was the subject of several phone and and written communications and when the applicant was last contacted in August 1989 he was fully advised as to his options and the manner in which he should proceed.  He has now been written to again and asked to indicate his intentions with regard to the application.</P>

      <P>I am aware of reports over the years, including recent reports, which suggest that oestrogen treatment over prolonged periods of time may bring about breast cancer.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1977, the National Drugs Advisory Board published an information booklet on oestrogen-containing products which drew attention to the possible side effects of such products, including the possible relationship with breast cancers.  The booklet also set out guidelines on the usage and prescribing of such products.  Furthermore, product authorisations granted in respect of such preparations, contain statements setting out the possible risks and side effects and make appropriate recommendations with regard to usage and prescribing regimes.</P>

      <P>The health boards maintain registers of &ldquo;Elderly at Risk&rdquo; and their professional staff are on the alert for possible abuse of the elderly.  I am satisfied that these health care personnel are competent to recognise any cases of abuse and deal with them as necessary.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="1463" /> My Department have not to date received a detailed formal proposal from the Western Health Board requesting sanction for a second consultant dermatologist appointment at University College Hospital, Galway.  Should such a proposal be received, it will be examined in the light of the board's priorities for service development and their overall financial position.</P>
      <P>The admission of an individual patient to hospital is a matter for the hospital authority and the consultant in charge of the case.  Waiting lists are kept under regular review and priority is given to urgent cases.  Should any patient feel that their condition has deteriorated, they should contact their general practitioner who will be in the best position to stress the urgency of the case to the consultant concerned.</P>

Furthermore when a manufacturer submits an application for a product authorisation, details of the labelling must accompany the application.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of, nor has my attention been drawn to, the allegation that an estimated 500 drug products failed to comply with the statutory labelling requirements as set out in these regulations and no prosecutions for such breaches have been made.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be referring to the range of medicinal products referred to in the second schedule to the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) (Amendment) Regulations, 1989.  These products are now subject to the controls stipulated in the principle regulations, including the labelling requirements.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to further curtail the number of drugs available either generally or on the GMS scheme.  I would point out that the availability of drugs and medicines in this country is subject to the controls set out in the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984-1989.  These regulations require that all medicine supplied in the country must be subject to a product authorisation granted by the Minister for Health, such authorisations only being granted following the assessment and advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>

      <P>The prescribing of tranquilisers is subject to the controls as set out for such drugs in the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1987.  Furthermore, in granting product authorisations for such preparations, attention is drawn to the possible side effects, including those that may arise from prolonged usage.  Medical practitioners prescribing tranquilisers would also be fully informed as to the possibility of such side effects. <Col N="1470" /> I am satisfied that the present regulations provide adequate controls in the matter.</P>

      <P>Gaelscoil Ui Riada, Baile an Easpaig, Corcaigh, is mainly accommodated in prefabricated buildings, which were provided since 1986.</P>
      <P>My Department has purchased a site with a view to providing a permanent building for the school.  In this connection the accommodation requirements are being examined at present with a view to determining the number of classrooms to be provided.  When this has been finalised, the question of the commencement of architectural planning will be considered, in the context of the large number of projects on hand and the available capital.</P>

In this regard Circular 24/82 was issued which provided guidelines for boards of management in relation to school standards. Subsection (i) of the section headed Hygiene states that: &ldquo;There should be a constantly available supply of hot water, soap, medically approved hand-drying facilities and toilet paper&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On the basis of recent discussions between my Department and Aeroflot, I have no reason to believe that Aeroflot have any plans to reduce their operations at Shannon Airport for the foreseeable future. On the contrary, I understand that Aeroflot plan to increase, rather than reduce, the number of services operated through Shannon.</P>
      <P>To further encourage these developments, I have recently granted rights to Aeroflot to operate services on a fifth freedom basis between Shannon and Gander, Miami and Washington and those services have already commenced between Shannon and Washington and Shannon and Miami.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is very close co-operation between Aer Rianta and Aeroflot in the promotion and development of business opportunities both at Shannon Airport and in the Soviet <Col N="1486" /> Union.  At present Aer Rianta and Shannon Development are working with Aeroflot to develop an integrated hub operation at Shannon, which would integrate Aeroflot's flights from Moscow and other points in the Soviet Union with flights from Shannon to North and South America.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that Aer Rianta and Aeroflot earlier this year extended for a further three years the technical transit agreement between both companies. This agreement deals with the terms and conditions under which Aeroflot uses Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>I believe all of these developments will be of mutual benefit to Aeroflot and Aer Rianta at Shannon Airport.</P>
