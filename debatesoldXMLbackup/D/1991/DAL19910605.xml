      <P>Will any legislative proposals emerge from the Taoiseach's meeting today with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in regard to jobs?  If so, <Col N="734" /> will the Taoiseach indicate whether any change in the programme between now and the summer recess will be required?</P>

      <P>In relation to proposed committees of the House, I wonder if the Taoiseach had an opportunity, over the long weekend, to reflect on a timetable and structure for the composition of committees of this House, particularly a crime committee and a foreign affairs committee?  Will he indicate whether these committees will be set up before the summer recess?</P>

      <P>I want to raise the colleges Bill which other Deputies and I have raised on a number of occasions.  I understand that the Bill is likely to be taken before the recess and that it will be rushed through in a day or so.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that if the Bill is taken it will be circulated and that there will be adequate time for the Deputies to make amendments to it?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know from where the Deputy gets these weird ideas. The Deputy should go back to whoever he is consulting and communicating with in regard to these matters because I can <Col N="735" /> assure him that there is no question of the Bill being rushed through.  It will be published this session but it may not be taken in this session.</P>

Will that hope &mdash; or aspiration &mdash; be adhered to or has the legislation been fundamentally changed to avoid any debate before the local elections?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Taoiseach indicated that he thought it would be neither useful nor essential for the House to have a debate on matters arising from the two European Community intergovernmental conferences.  May I ask him, following the informal meeting of the Council of Ministers in Dresden over the weekend and the ECOFIN Council meeting if he still holds that view and if he intends to provide time between now and the end of this session, I presume in <Col N="739" /> July, for a debate on the report on the Luxembourg Council?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach is aware, there is a statutory obligation on the Government to publish every six months a report on activities in the European Community and to have it debated here.  May I ask him, in view of the fact that Deputy Deasy has raised a very serious question about the agricultural price talks and in view of other pending developments in the European Community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The section amends section 4 of the Act of 1980 by inserting paragraph (aa) which reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Governing Body, by order assign to the University such additional functions in relation to the education and training of teachers in accordance with such terms and conditions as may be determined from time to time by the Minister. </P>
      <P>This is an important section in that it deals with the basis on which the teacher training college will be amalgamated with the new campus at Plassey Park.  I made the point during the course of my Second Stage contribution last week that there is a need to extend where possible the concurrency modules to ensure there is hands on involvement together with training; in other words, there should be on-the-spot training in the classroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> This should be the norm within the existing faculties in the University of Limerick. As we are aware, they get a tremendous grinding in the various disciplines where an innovative approach has been adopted by the principal of the college, Dr. Walsh.  I think the principle of concurrency, as recommended in an article by John Lowe in a recent OECD observer report should be extended where possible.</P>

      <P>That is so.  If I understand Deputy Higgins correctly, he is concerned to ensure that the current practices will be continued in the teacher training section of the new university when Thomond College is dissolved.  He has suggested that there is a need to simulate classroom modules but that is the current practice within teacher training colleges.  He is concerned that the prevailing thrust of innovative measures, modules and initiatives adopted by the University of Limerick will be carried into the teacher training modules when Thomond College will be assimilated into the University of Limerick.  That is what I understand the Deputy to have expressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  What I am asking is that within the spirit of the legislation, which gives additional powers and functions, we would exhort people to incorporate as many new approaches to the training of teachers as possible and that there should be as much experimentation as possible.  Just as the University of Limerick has been one of the pioneers of innovation in its field, I would hope this will become the hallmark of teacher training within the new merged institution. It should be as adventurous as possible in taking on every possible new module and mode of experimentation.</P>

      <P>In a university there are lecturers and professors from all over the world all products of different teacher training programmes, some of whom may have a background in teacher training, and it would be as well to avail of their skills and experience in the new set-up. We can learn from the experience gained in other countries.  We could benefit from a new approach, although I am not saying there is anything wrong with the existing teacher training courses.  We should benefit from the experience of the many eminent people who lecture on the campus, and outside the university.  It is worth exploring their theories on teacher training and we might all benefit from taking them on board.  Originaly, I did not quite understand the point the Deputy was making but I support his viewpoint now.</P>

      <P>I am fully in agreement with the section which provides for the assigning of additional functions relating to the education and training of teachers to the university.  The Minister may by order assign such additional functions and that is correct because of the changing nature of teaching and society generally.  Will the Minister explain the reason for the words &ldquo;in accordance with such terms and conditions as may be determined from time to time by the Minister&rdquo;.  I can understand what is meant by &ldquo;the Minister may, .... by order assign to the University such additional functions in relation to the education and training of teachers&rdquo; but I find it difficult to understand the meaning of &ldquo;such terms and conditions&rdquo; as the Minister may lay down.  Does this relate to the terms and conditions of the teachers and students or does it relate to the terms under which the functions will be assigned, or taught?  I would appreciate it if the Minister would clarify this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points have been raised.  There is common agreement on the point raised by Deputy Higgins, where he identified the need for experimentation and dynamism and change within the teacher training experience and that this should be helped along by <Col N="745" /> the innovative measures of the University of Limerick.  Deputy Mac Giolla's point flows on from that.  Deputy Kemmy agreed with this viewpoint and stressed that in a university there is a meeting of minds of various disciplines and that the experience of various disciplines and cultures could be absorbed into the teacher training process.  I should like to digress for a minute.  This is one of the ways teacher training is going to develop.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming OECD report, of which I have seen a draft, recommends that we change from the present practice of isolating teacher training establishments, whereby the teacher training college and just teacher training alone is on a campus of its own.  The OECD report, various educational experts and I are of the opinion that the era of the isolated teacher training college is over, that there is now a need for interaction between the various disciplines on a common university campus and that trainee teachers on such courses can only benefit from being exposed to all sorts of other influences, disciplines, ideas and cultures as goes on in a university.</P>
      <P>While the content of teacher training courses is excellent, there is a need for constant examination of them and this is needed nowhere more than in teacher training.  As Deputy Mac Giolla said, the world is changing so much and teachers are required to be so many things to so many people some of whom may have many difficulties.  The status of teachers, where a teacher was seen as a person with authority, to whom people have due regard, no matter what the circumstances, is sadly changing and there is a great need for teachers to have as well as their professionalism, a huge degree of flexibility and to have been exposed to all sorts of directions and winds of change. Over the past few years I have felt there is a need for an indepth look at the content of the curriculum in teacher training establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know teachers undergo constant reassessment and are constantly innovative. The location of the teacher training college within the University of Limerick will be a first step in that process which, <Col N="746" /> as I said, will be recommended by the OECD and to which the Government set their face in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I agree with the views expressed here today.  Deputy Mac Giolla asked what was meant by &ldquo;in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Minister, ... directs&rdquo;. This follows on from the points we have been debating.  If we find there is a need for a change of direction or for diversification in teacher training colleges or in the curriculum, as it is now within the university that will be possible.  That is a logical consequence in the light of the emerging debate on the need of the trainers of teachers within the educational system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for clarifying the matter.  We broadly agree with her.  Public education policy embraces the concept of an all graduate teaching profession and this should be reflected as far as possible in a similarity and consistency of training.  One of the great strengths of teacher training education, particularly at Thomond College of Education, and what it brings to the University of Limerick, is that it is concurrent teacher education, that it hands on, day by day involvement, as opposed to consecutive education, where one does the B.A., B.Sc, or B.Comm, or B.Ag and then follows with a Higher Diploma in Education.  In other words a student pursues a particular course for three or four years and then spends one on the H.Dip course.</P>
      <P>Thomond College has excelled in the preparation of graduates.  Report after report from management bodies and school principals endorsed the concept of concurrency in glowing terms.  It would be a most retrograde step, of almost asinine proportions &mdash; I hate to use that word &mdash; if we were to go from concurrent to consecutive education.  It would undermine the principles of the only institution in the country that prepares teachers in this way, with the possible exception of the colleges of home economics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no cheap way of training teachers well.  Poor training, as has been <Col N="747" /> discovered in other countries, ultimately costs the Exchequer dearly.  If we do not have good training modules in place we end up with endless in-service needs, trying to correct the deficiencies and gaps that are there.  It leads to a lack of leadership in programme and curricular design and planning.  The argument for continuing the concurrency element in the University of Limerick is supported by statistics and analyses.  I do not believe it is in danger but it should be fundamentally enshrined in the thinking of the new institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The concurrency point is fully recognised.  All education debates lead to a wonderful exchange of ideas.  There will be debates in the future as to a common type of pre-service education for teachers but that is for another day.  I am strongly of the opinion that proper pre-service training must be looked at.  I accept the points which have been made.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the governing body was dealt with at some length on Second Stage.  This is the nub of the problem in merging any institutions. In this case one third level institution is being brought under the umbrella of the other.  Maximum trust and confidence is of the essence in terms of the long term survival and prosperity of the new institution.  There has been considerable in-depth analysis of the background of the two institutions and what would be desirable in terms of merging their ethos and putting together a framework which would stand Limerick and the south-west in good stead.  In order to allay any residual distrust, consideration should be given to providing places on the governing body, at least for <Col N="748" /> a limited period, for some members of the former governing body of Thomond College of Education.  I suggested that the Minister might sympathetically consider including four staff members from Thomond on the governing body of the university as an interim measure to facilitate smooth transition and to ease whatever residual staff concerns might exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the central part of this short Bill.  Both institutions can benefit and there will be an improved ethos on the university campus as a result of the merger.  The Minister may also benefit when she comes to deal with the resistance which exists at all levels of education to mergers and amalgamations. This merger can be a model and a proto-type for the future.  The Minister will be able to indicate that these two third level institutions have come together in a civilised way for the benefit of students and third level education in general.  This can be achieved.</P>
      <P>It is a measure of the agreement among all parties in this House that so few amendments have been tabled.  The Bill has received widespread acclamation and support in the university and in Thomond College.  The Minister said last week that perhaps we should stop thinking in terms of these separate entities because when the Bill goes through Thomond College will cease to exist and the structures of the university will be available to people now in Thomond College.  I accepted the Minister's point, as did people from Thomond College who were in the public gallery to hear the Minister's replies to my questions that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While accepting that Thomond College will no longer be a separate entity after the passage of this Bill, the spirit of what we are suggesting should be incorporated by Dr. Walsh and the governing body in the running of the new institution. I referred last week to an informal committee which has been set up by Dr. Walsh.  It is a sub-committee of the governing body who act as an advisory group on the day-to-day running of the university.  There is nothing to stop a <Col N="749" /> person in Dr. Walsh's position from setting up such a body to assist him.  The board of governors have an overview and consider policy in general but the practical running of the university is carried out by this informal committee.  Since this committee are not mentioned in the Bill it has not been possible to put down an amendment in relation to them, but I would hope that Dr. Walsh would take account of our ideas and would include in such committees people who can make a valuable contribution.</P>
    <P>The election of a new board of governors will not take place until next year and it can be contested in the normal way.  In the meantime there is no reason why Dr. Walsh could not expand the informal committee to incorporate people from Thomond College.  This is a matter of some contention among people at the college and I have told them to have faith in the Minister and in this House.  We will insist that democratic structures be put in place and that the rule of democracy prevails in the university. There are some slight fears in this respect which could be removed by our stating that we want to see democracy operate in the new university structure so that people who have something to contribute will be welcomed by the Minister and by Dr. Walsh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former student of the NIHE which later became Thomond College, I have a special interest in what is happening.  My fear is that physical education will become marginalised in the new structure.  We must ensure that all possible safeguards are put in place so that this will not happen.  Already physical educational has been reduced within the existing Thomond College, which has produced only 20 PE graduates each year for the past two years.  Previously there were 50 or more.  The structure of the new board of management must include people who have an interest in physical education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not just talking about amalgamating Thomond College with the university but about amalgamating the <Col N="750" /> former National College of Physical Education and additional faculties within Thomond College, namely, the metalwork faculty, the woodwork faculty and the rural science faculty.  I am afraid that physical education could lose out.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take this on board because physical education is enormously important to children in secondary school and, indeed, in primary school.  Because of the pressure of the points system at secondary level, physical education is becoming marginalised in our secondary schools and it is almost non existent in our primary schools.  We must ensure that within the new framework of the University of Limerick physical education will not be the poor relation.  To ensure that it does not become the poor relation we must have strong people representing the physical education faculty on the board of management. I see a great future for physical education in the new university provided it is awarded its proper status and gets the necessary resources.  Physical education here could be enhanced.  However, it has to be handled carefully so that it does not become the poor relation and totally marginalised within a bigger framework.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the thrust of what has been said by the Deputies. There is a legal difficulty in that with the passing of this Bill the college ceases to exist.  Deputies, quite properly, have not put down amendments because one cannot have representatives of a college that no longer exists imposed upon the new merged institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three representatives on the governing body of the university but when their term of office ceases they will not be left on the board because there will no longer be a Thomond College. How can we then go along with the spirit of the debate?  The Minister can nominate nine members and I am prepared to give a commitment that there will be representation on the governing body of the university for the physical education faculty, and I would hope that future Ministers for Education would do likewise, thus carrying on the tradition of the <Col N="751" /> original Thomond College.  We cannot do this in a formal way because of the legal position but, in the light of the very good debate we had on this issue.  I feel it would be incumbent on whoever is in this position to see that physical education will be represented.</P>
    <P>I know the president of the college and the governing body have a great respect for the inheritance they are receiving and will seek, although they would have to do so in an informal way, to give expression to the traditions of Thomond College in the setting up period which will be difficult and have its own challenges to be faced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan said he did not want to see the discipline of physical education becoming marginalised within the new college.  He went on to say he had great hopes for physical education because it would now be enclosed within the new University of Limerick.  That is how we should look at it, not as an increasingly threatened discipline standing on its own and less able to stand on its own as the years go by.  Its absorbtion within the new university should give physical education a recognition as a distinct discipline within the new university and an even more enhanced standing and reputation, if that were possible because it is already high, than heretofore.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point made by Deputies that the wishes of the representatives of Thomond College be carried out in the interim 12 month period, we want that too.  The public representatives piloting this Bill through the House wish to put on the record that we do not wish to see anybody diminished in the process even though they cannot be formally recognised since they no longer exist.  We hope that in less than 12 months time when there is a new governing body the ministerial nominees to that body would reflect the tradition of Thomond College.</P>

      <P>This section gave rise to quite a good debate last week.  My amendment seeks to be a compromise between amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  I recognise what both Deputies are seeking.  I wished to be accommodatory and to put forward an amendment on Report Stage but the Bills Office advised me I should do it now.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage each speaker dwelt on and emphasised the need for maximum concentration on culture and the humanities.  We had an interesting debate on that and the Minister responded in kind.  Section 10 of the Bill provides that: &ldquo;The University in relation to the performance of its functions shall have due regard to the preservation and promotion of the Irish language and culture.&rdquo;. I suggested that by moving commas around or juxtapositioning the wording different interpretations could be arrived at.  Fundamentally we are all seeking the same thing, that is, to ensure we keep cognisance, recognition and a <Col N="753" /> consciousness of the humanities within the new university.</P>
      <P>One of the hallmarks of universities over the years, indeed since their inception, is that they have managed to withstand the test of time.  They have come back stronger than ever after rebellions, revolutions, civil war and civil strife. They have managed to fly their own banner and come out of all kinds of strife undaunted in pursuing and achieving their ideals and objectives.  One of the kernel features that distinguishes universities from other institutions has been the emphasis on the humanities and the cultural dimension.</P>
      <P>In no way, am I castigating the University of Limerick.  I appreciate that the university plays a very vital role in developing engineering, electronics and so on, and I welcome the influence Thomond College will quite rightly bring to bear on this.  By bringing Thomond College of Education and the university into a new education constituency, we will complement the hard core economic faculties that are there already.</P>
      <P>My concern is first, that any new merged institution will have cultural consideration as a paramount consideration and they never lose sight of the fact that having the title of university, which they sought and were given in this House, they would seek to fulfil that remit by a consciousness and a cognisance of culture and all things cultural and second that they would pay special and in this day and age, much needed attention to the Irish dimension.</P>
      <P>I feel the explanatory memorandum to the Bill is not quite accurate in saying that sections 10, 11 and 12 are self-explanatory. They are not self-explanatory. The fact that we are debating this in detail is an indication that there is need to explain exactly what we are trying to achieve here.  Therefore, I have put down an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the Minister is seeking to be accommodating and to introduce a compromise amendment, but my amendment goes somewhat further.  I wish the Bill to provide that &ldquo;The University in <Col N="754" /> relation to the performance of its functions shall have due regard to the preservation and promotion of the Irish language in its general administration&rdquo;&mdash; in other words in the day to day running of the college &mdash;&ldquo;as a teaching medium&rdquo;.  After all, it is the first official language and even though it may not be practicable to have it as a teaching medium in all classes, I think it is important to consider this at a time when the language is very much under siege and there is a dispute going on.  We do not know the situation.  The late Brendáin O hEithir, who had a deep personal and abiding interest in the language, published a report prior to his sad and early demise, saying the number of day to day active Gaelic speakers was now down to 10,000.  When you get to that level of day to day first language participation, the language is under threat as we have known for some time.  Therefore, when we seem to be at a crossroads &mdash; I know that is a cliché &mdash; in relation to the preservation and retention of the very life of the language, we should try, particularly in educational institutions, to incorporate its use as an administrative language within the college.  After all, apart from the very welcome interlinkage, interchange and intercourse with other countries which Professor Dr. Edward Walsh has managed to pioneer very successfully, and it is a large part of the success of the Limerick story that they have managed to interchange on an ongoing basis with third level institutions abroad, the vast majority of the students will naturally always remain to be natives of this country.  They will have come through second level, they will have had Irish up to intermediate and leaving certificates levels and they will have a fundamental working knowledge of it.  Just as somebody in this House is obligated if all goes to all to be <i>au fait</i> with the language or somebody had the right to go before the courts and demand that their case be heard through the medium of the first national language, we should set down as a desirable objective that the language should be the language of general administration within the college.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> Therefore, I formally move my amendment that the &ldquo;language in its general administration as a teaching medium and as an academic subject and culture in the broadest possible sense&rdquo; should be enshrined in the terms of incorporation of the new institution.</P>

Tá sé suimiúil nach bhfuil ach trí leasuithe ar an mBille iomlán, agus tá baint acu go léir leis an ábhar céanna, múineadh na Gaeilge nó ceist na Gaeilge.  Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil na múinteoirí ag cailliúint a gcuid Gaeilge le blianta fada anuas agus tá go leor múinteoirí ann anois nach bhfuil an cumas iontu aon rud a mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge, cé go mb'fhéidir go bhfuil tuiscint don Ghaeilge agus labhairt na teanga acu.  Is í an tslí ina bhfuilimid ag dul anois ná go bhfuil na gaelscoileanna ag fás ar fud na tíre agus beidh scoileanna dara leibhéal ag fás chomh maith.  Fágann sé sin go mbeidh na múinteoirí sna ghnáthscoileanna Béarla gan mórán suime acu sa Ghaeilge.  Beidh na múinteoirí eile oilte ó thaobh labhairt na Gaeilge de agus is iadsan a bheidh ag múineadh sna gaelscoileanna ag an mbunleibhéal agus sna scoileanna dara leibhéal freisin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh an dá chineál múinteoirí againn <Col N="756" /> feasta, múinteoirí gan Gaeilge agus múinteoirí le Gaeilge.  Mar sin, tá sé thar am ag an Aire agus ag an Rialtas rud éigin a dhéanamh i dtreo is go mbeidh an oiliúint chéanna ag na múinteoirí go léir agus go mbeidh ar a gcumas Gaeilge a mhúineadh i cibé scoil ina bhfuil siad, bíodh sí ina scoil Bhéarla nó ina gaelscoil. Is dócha go mbeidh múineadh teanga ar an gcúrsa, pé scéal é, Fraincis agus Gearmáinis agus mar sin, ach baineann na leasuithe atá thíos anseo go díreach le múineadh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna chun go mbeidh na múinteoirí in ann gach uile ábhar a mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge, más gá. Má éiríonn linn anseo &mdash; agus maidir leis an leasú atá thíos ag an Aire féin, is dócha go nglacfar leis, agus má ghlactar leis beimid ag cur mairc síos, ag rá gur seo an tslí ar chóir dúinn a thógáil, is é sin, oiliúint na múinteoirí go léir.</P>
    <P>I hope that what we are doing here will be a first step towards bringing about change in the training of teachers so that they will be capable of teaching all subjects through Irish.  Teachers should be able to move from school to school, regardless of whether subjects are taught through Irish or English.  That used to be the case but it was gradually abandoned by the teacher training colleges with the result that many teachers are not able to teach subjects through Irish.  They are able to understand and speak Irish but they do not have the confidence or ability to teach subjects through Irish.  We have to deal with this problem and ensure that teachers are able to teach all subjects through Irish.</P>
    <P>I am glad this point is being debated on Committee Stage.  The Minister has pointed out that teacher training in Irish will be an essential function of the new university.  That is basically what we are proposing in our amendments.  Deputy Higgins has included an extra dimension in his amendment and referred to &ldquo;language in its general administration&rdquo;.  I agree with him that Irish should be used as a teaching medium, which is what I propose also.  I presume the Minister intends the college to have due regard to Irish as a teaching medium.  I should like Deputy Higgins to explain why he has <Col N="757" /> included the words &ldquo;general administration&rdquo; in his amendment, which I think is the only difference between us at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an cheist seo.  The Minister's amendment made a very positive attempt to marry the proposals put forward in Deputy Higgins's and Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment.  I have no difficulty with the Minister's amendment. However, I am somewhat confused by Deputy Higgins's amendment.  I do not wish to be pernickety but perhaps there should be a comma after the word &ldquo;administration&rdquo; in his amendment.  His amendment is rather vague as it stands and perhaps could be better drafted. Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment is simple and to the point.  As I said, the Minister has attempted to incorporate the best of both amendments in her amendment.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few other points.  Last year Professor Breandán Ó Madagáin of University College Galway assessed the merits and worth of the teaching of Irish in Thomond College.  On 13 July last year, he wrote to Liam O'Doherty, Irish Language Department, Thomond College, informing him that he had sent a report to the NCEA on the teaching of Irish in Thomond College.  He said, and I quote:</P>
      <P>I should like to repeat last year's comment, namely that the teaching of Irish to B.A. level in Thomond College is very impressive and well up to university standard both as regards language teaching and literature courses. The teaching of the language itself, both oral and written, deserves special commendation.  One is impressed also by the spirit and enthusiasm among both staff and students, and the excellent rapport between them. </P>
      <P>One could not receive a higher commendation from any visiting examiner than that by Breandán Ó Madagáin on the worth of the Irish department in Thomond College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present Irish is an entry requirement <Col N="758" /> to Thomond College.  I hope this requirement will be continued.  It is mandatory for all trainee teachers taking four existing degree courses &mdash; physical education, wood and building technology, metal and engineering technology and rural and general science &mdash; to have Irish.  Students undertaking the four year degree course in Irish in this college achieve standards comparable to university graduates in Irish.  This course is at present only available to students of physical education as an elective or second subject in Thomond College.  A mandatory three year &ldquo;professional&rdquo; Irish course is taught to all students in Thomond College.  This includes a mandatory three week Gaeltacht course for all students at the end of the first year funded primarily by the college.  Subject to the availability of funding, students can also attend additional Gaeltacht courses.  I hope this option will continue to be available to students so that they will be able to brush up on their Irish.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the training of teachers of Irish in Thomond College.  Graduates of the PE course with Irish as their elective subject are trained as teachers of Irish for the post-primary sector.  A very high standard has been achieved by these students over the years and they have been well received in schools.  The college has developed a pre-service course to train a number of students each year for the Irish-medium post-primary sector.  I hope that the links this college has with the Department of Education and other colleges will be continued so that they can feed off each other and help each other in this respect.  Post-graduate studies are also being undertaken in the college and one thesis is being completed at present.  The staffing in the Irish department of Thomond College includes one senior lecturer, one lecturer and one assistant lecturer, very competent people who give good value for money.</P>
    <P>I hope that after the integration of Thomond College with the University of Limerick Irish will continue to be an entry requirement for courses in that university. The University of Limerick <Col N="759" /> should receive parity with other universities in teaching the Irish language and should work actively with other agencies, the Department, Bord na Gaeilge and the Higher Education Authority.  If this is achieved the Minister will receive the full co-operation and support of the university.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment should not be regarded by fanatics of the Irish language as a charter on the teaching of Irish.  In the past the teaching of Irish was bedevilled by fanaticism which gave Irish a very bad name.  Sometimes it led to the adoption of a very narrow approach in the teaching of Irish.  If the Minister adopts some of our proposals in regard to the teaching of Irish in the university, it will be regarded as a progressive step forward, a step which will benefit the language, the University of Limerick and other universities also.</P>

      <P>Tá sé nach bhfuil ach cúpla leasú ar an mBille seo, Bille a gcuirimid fáilte roimhe go ginearálta, is iad sin na leasuithe a bhaineann le mír a deich den Bhille, agus go speisialta, cás na teanga Gaeilge.  Bhíomar go léir, a bhfuil suim againn sa Ghaeilge, i ndul chun cinn na Gaeilge agus i muintir na Gaeltachta, thar a bheith sásta leis an obair a bhí á déanamh le blianta anuas ag Coláiste Thua-Mhumhan maidir le teagasc agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge, agus leis an aitheantas a bhí á thabhairt don teanga agus don chúltúr Ghaelach. Tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh an t-aitheantas, an tacaíocht agus an stádas céanna ag an teanga sa chónascadh úr in Ollscoil Luimnigh agus a bhí ag an Ghaeilge go dtí seo i gColáiste Thua-Mhumhan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá buntáistí móra ag baint le hOllscoil Luimnigh maidir leis an chónascadh; tá dámh nó faculty iomlán Gaeilge ag teacht isteach in Ollscoil Luimnigh, nach raibh acu go dtí seo.  D'aontaigh mé ar fad leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Teachta Kemmy, go bhfuil stádas agus caighdeán an-ard ann agus aitheantas le fáil ó na extern examiners a luaigh sé maidir leis an chaighdeán Gaeilge atá sa choláiste.  Is é an <Col N="760" /> príomhdhualgas a bhí ar Choláiste Thua-Mhumhan ná múinteoirí a oiliúint, agus iad ag dul amach ar fud na tíre ag teagasc na ndaltaí.  Tá sé riachtanach go mbeadh cumas Gaeilge ag múinteoirí &mdash; agus b'amhlaidh an scéal i gColáiste Thua-Mhumhan &mdash; agus freisin go mbeadh an rud céanna le fáil nuair a chuirtear an cónascadh seo i gcrích.  Mar shampla, tá sé de pholasaí ag Coláiste Thua-Mhumhan, ní amháin ábhar múinteoirí as na Gaeltachtaí a ghlacadh isteach, ach duine ar bith gur mian leis agus a bhfuil an cumas ann teagasc trí Ghaeilge nó trí Bhéarla.  Tá polasaí dátheangach acu agus sin rud go gcaithfimid béim a chur air san am atá romhainn.  Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sé sásúil dá mbeadh múinteoirí ag teacht amach agus gan ar a gcumas na hábhair a theagasc trí Ghaeilge.  Tá dhá chúrsa Gaeilge i gColáiste Thua-Mhumhan.</P>
    <P>One course gives the opportunity of getting a degree in the Irish language that is on a par and up to the standard available at any of our other universities. Deputy Kemmy has given the views of one of the extern examiners, Professor Madigan, University College, Galway, who has praised the standard attained by the students who pursue a degree course in Irish at Thomond College.  As well as that there is a professional course in the Irish language where all students attending Thomond College &mdash; and it has been a tradition for many years &mdash; are obliged to attend courses in the Gaeltacht areas. They attend Gaeltacht areas in Donegal, Galway, Mayo &mdash; Deputy Higgins would be familiar with that &mdash; Cork and Kerry in the month of June with teachers or trainee teachers from the other trainee teacher colleges. this gives them the opportunity of hearing the Irish language spoken in a natural way.  I hope that tradition will be allowed to continue when the amalgamation has taken place.</P>
    <P>We know that preparations are being made for the ceard teastas Gaeilge, a qualification that is necessary for all post-primary teachers, particularly in the vocational sector.  An effort was made in the Groener case, which was taken to the European Court, to show that the teastas <Col N="761" /> was no longer necessary.  However the court had the good sense to say that it was a legitimate aspiration of the Department, the authorities and the Government as a support for the Irish language, and it is as necessary today as it has been in the past.  It must continue in the future if we are serious about the preservation and the protection of the language.</P>
    <P>When the amalgamation is operating and if it ever comes to the stage where the new University of Limerick will require a second language, I hope Irish will qualify as a second language.  At the national university it is necessary to have Irish in order to matriculate.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify whether Irish is a required subject for entry into the new University of Limerick?  If in future a second language is demanded, as universities are inclined to do at present with the emphasis on European languages, for example, French, German or Italian, I do not think Irish should be ignored but should qualify as a second language requirement.</P>
    <P>I am a member of Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge &mdash; the Joint Committee on the Irish Language &mdash; where this matter arose at one of our meetings recently. Some concern was expressed about the future status of Irish because of the amalgamation. We have been very pleased with the manner in which the Irish faculty has been developed at Thomond.  We believe they are going into the new amalgamation with a readymade faculty with a national recognition from academics from other universities.  In the new marriage I hope this tradition will be maintained, nurtured and supported for the benefit of the teachers who will qualify from this university in the future and for the ultimate benefit of the young people who will be taught by the teachers in the coming years.  If they want to have the opportunity of studying whatever subject, whether corpoideachas, mar a dúirt mo chara, an Teachta Deenihan, nó aon ábhar eile, ba cheart go mbeadh deis acu é sin a dhéanamh i nGaeilge, má bhíonn an fonn sin orthu.  Más féidir leis an Aire an guarantee sin a thabhairt dúinne anseo inniu, beimid sásta.  Murar féidir léi é a <Col N="762" /> thabhairt dúinn, sílim gur chéim mhór ar gcúl é, ag cur san áireamh an méid atá déanta ag Coláiste Thua-Mhumhan go dtí seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without appearing to be nostalgic I remember the early days of the former national college of physical education quite vividly.  In the first year we had our education in Tralee.  In the second year we were an amalgamation of those who went to Strawberry Hill in England, Sion Hill and Ling College.  On arriving back at Limerick we did not know what to expect.  One of the first things that struck me was the great Irish ethos that had developed within the college, especially the whole attitude towards the Irish language.  For the first time ever an attempt was made to take the emphasis off the grammer of the Irish language and to put more emphasis on the spoken language, the folklore and the literature of Ireland. Irrespective of what course one pursued all students who went through the college had to go on a number of field trips to Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>There were field trips to Dingle, Connemara and other parts of Gaelic Ireland. Irrespective of whether one pursued Irish studies one went on those field trips.  An effort was made to encourage the use of the Irish language in the teaching of physical education and second subjects. The Irish ethos was developed by the great personnel in the National College of Physical Education at that time, but, The Irish those was developed by the great personnel in the National College of Physical Education at that time, but, unfortunately, because many of these great innovators were frustrated by the narrow exam system at the time they left the college.  There was no place in the system for what they were trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Thomond College or the National College of Education were opening now they would be better suited to the new junior curriculum.  A number of graduates who tried to encourage Irish studies and, in my case, environmental studies, could not pursue the integrated line of study they were trained to pursue because they had to adhere rigidly to an examination syllabus.  However, now, nearly <Col N="763" /> 20 years later, there is a different philosophy in secondary schools.  The principle of integrated studies that existed then should be continued in the new structure.  Irish studies should be emphasised now more than ever because there is scope for this type of education.  That early period was a great time of curriculum innovation, re-orientation and change within the college.  There were great people there like Dr. Mulcahy, who later went back to Cork university, and many more who were light years before their time and left the college for many reasons.  I know from contact with some of these people that they left out of frustration because what they were doing then had little relevance to the education system as it existed.  As a result of the changes that have taken place since, including the introduction of the junior curriculum, their philosophy would be more acceptable in present day education.</P>
    <P>I hope this section, and the amendment proposed by the Minister, is not merely a sop to a Gaeilgeoir lobby but will provide much needed support for the humanities and culture generally within the University of Limerick.  We know the University of Limerick has been successful in promoting a technological culture, but it now needs to educate for a broader understanding of the Irish context of technology in particular.  The new University of Limerick has a powerful technological influence.  Even abroad that university is recognised as the technological centre of Ireland in university terms.  It surpasses all other universities in that respect.  It is developing in conjunction with the development of the Plassey technological park.</P>
    <P>We are now amalgamating Thomond College, which is a very small college, with a rapidly progressing technological college.  This provides a great challenge and great hopes if the matter is dealt with properly but there is also a danger involved.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure in so far as she can that the Thomond element, which will be a very small element in the new structure, will not be <Col N="764" /> marginalised in terms of physical education. I envisage that happening because there are powerful forces within the new University of Limerick for change and technological development.  Having read what some people said in the past I fear that their philosophy will be submerged in the overall philosophy of the college. There is hope for physical education within the scientific aspect of the new university, but the whole Gaelic culture must be seen as part and parcel of the overall philosophy.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the copyright provisions of the University of Limerick Act.  That legislation designated the university library as a depository of Irish material.  If the university is to meet its obligation under the copyright provisions it will need adequate library resources, which have not been provided up to now. I ask the Minister to comment on that matter in her reply.  I know the Minister has a commitment to a smooth transition. As a person who has had experience on campus and has a deep interest in what happened in the National College of Physical Education, I hope the Minister will not lose sight of the great concept and spirit held by the people in the college at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reservations about legislation that brings in an element of compulsion in terms of the Irish language in the education area.  It is a little like legislating for private morality; there may be compliance but to have to follow a certain line because one has to does not make one virtuous.  As my colleague, Deputy Kemmy said, the wording of the amendment is acceptable.  Obviously at the end of the day what is important is the teaching and use of Irish in the University of Limerick and how it affects the pupils and fosters the use of the Irish language in the community generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy referred earlier to elements of fanaticism that have bedevilled the Irish language movement in the past.  The initiative being taken by the Minister in publishing a Green Paper will benefit those who are interested in the Irish language and indeed education <Col N="765" /> generally.  It will provide an opportunity for a wide-ranging and fundamental debate on the Irish language, its value in the cultural sense and its use.  There are too many people who have not thought out their position on the Irish language and do not realise its total relevance and importance in terms of identifying us as we are.  It is part of our development. Place names all over the country are based on the Irish language and a great deal of history is to be found even at this level.</P>
    <P>I agree with the line the amendment is following.  Such an amendment is not a knee-jerk response to any of the more fanatical lines of though on the Irish language movement.  It leaves the door open for the continuation of the existing ethos in Thomond College, as was outlined by my colleague, Deputy Kemmy.</P>
    <P>The country needs to decide whether it wants the Irish language, why it wants the Irish language, and what is the value of the Irish language.  I am deeply committed to the Irish language, but it would be dishonest for me to say that there was in general overwhelming support for the revival of Irish and its greater use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé sásta go bhfuil na trí leasuithe mar an gcéanna.  I am satisfied that the three amendments follow the same text, as has been recognised. I wish to go through various points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins spoke on his original tenet of the humanities and the cultural consideration that should be given to them and he set Irish in that wider context. An excellent debate was held on that matter last week.  He pointed out that historically universities have had to withstand conflicts from without.  Of course, conflicts from within are much more politicised and acute.  The old idea of university towns keeping alive the spirit and ethos of education is always evoked.  Limerick has a long way to go to inherit much of that tradition.  However, the city itself is ancient and historic and has withstood many conflicts and invansion. <Col N="766" /> Indeed, this year they are holding their tricentennial celebrations.  The beginning of the University of Limerick and the setting up of its traditions should tie in well at this time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins made a point I would agree with.  Today he repeated a point that he had made last week when he said that sections 10, 11 and 12 were self-explanatory. I thought they were too scant, and today we have talked on the matter and have had an opportunity to open that out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the late Breandán Ó hEithir and his fears for the Irish language.  As he finished I wrote down &ldquo;Gael scoil&rdquo;.  Deputy Mac Giolla spoke on many matters, but he dwelt on the issue of Gael scoil.  The late Breandán Ó hEithir's report marked Gael scoil as being beacons of light in the landscape of the Irish language, in its teaching and in its promotion.  That is true.  The Department and I were very pleased to note that because we have a very positive policy towards them.  Parents are brought into the pedagogic environment of the Gael scoil and partake in both out-of-class and in-class activities.  Deputy Mac Giolla said that teachers who teach in the Gael scoil should not be seen to be distinctly different in their competence in Irish and their teaching of Irish from the teachers who teach in the mainstream primary schools.  That is a source of constant concern.</P>
    <P>Last year when the panel system was in operation difficulties were faced with regard to teachers deemed to be &ldquo;adept enough&rdquo; in the teaching of Irish to teach in the Gael scoil.  That position should not exist.  I take the Deputy's point that there should be freedom of movement between all of the schools and that primary teachers should be seen to be &mdash; as I believe they are &mdash; competent enough to teach in any primary school under the State's aegis.  I am concerned that there might be thought to be a difference of quality in the teaching of Irish.  That would be more a perception than a reality, but it does need to be examined. Also referred to was the need to preserve <Col N="767" /> the ethos of the Irish language and culture. I thank the Deputy for agreeing with the composite amendment.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Jim Kemmy for his contribution.  It was most interesting to hear of Professor Madigan's 13 July 1990 external evaluation of the teaching of Irish in Thomond.  He referred to the impressive level of Irish teaching in the college.  Again, that is the dowry that Thomond brings into the merger.  It is one of the strengths that more and more will be seen to be part and parcel of the multi-disciplinary University of Limerick. The Deputy accepted the amendment with that spirit in mind.  He rightly pointed out the possible danger of people on the extreme fringes of any movement &mdash; not just the Irish movement &mdash; thinking that they, and only they, and their method of doing something, were right. The general thrust of the Deputy's comments, as with the ideas expressed in all contributions today, was of great interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley reinforced what has been said, and spoke of the need to continue in the University of Limerick, in Munster in general and in the whole country with the tradition held very strongly in Thomond.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan could not help but look back, what is the expression, <i>&ldquo;a la recherche de temps perdu</i>&rdquo;.  I hope the House will excuse the use of another language.  We all start to look back as we get older, I suppose, but Deputy Deenihan appears to have had a very happy time in London and when he came back to Limerick.  He spoke nostalgically of field trips, but we shall not go into the extra curricular activities, which I am sure were part and parcel of the Deputy's education, both in a general sense and as a teacher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is colouring his memory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that might be right &mdash;<i>la vie en rose.</i>  The Deputy's contribution was very interesting.  He can tell the House how it was, how it is and <Col N="768" /> how it should be.  His opinions are valued because of his on the job experience. He also spoke of the perhaps stultifying atmosphere that physical education teachers of the time faced and of the need for curriculum development there.  The concept of a healthy mind in a healthy body, <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>, holds today as strong as ever it did in the ancient tradition of education.  That is what all education seeks to emulate and to provide for the young person.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also spoke about the Copyright Bill.  That legislation requires that every publication be made available for public perusal, that has been done. The Deputy widened the issue a little to talk about library facilities.  That goes slightly beyond the realms of the Copyright Bill but, at the same time, the Deputy was entitled to talk about the need for more libraries.</P>
      <P>The discussion on the amendment has been very useful in its general widening of the debate on the universality of universities, of the place of the humanities and the context of Irish.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea talked about the Green Paper and referred to his distrust of compulsory legislation on such matters. He said that while agreement could be reached in the letter, it was a different matter for the spirit.  That is sometimes a nebulous thing.  We can talk of it here, and there have been useful debates on it, but the way it is later expressed and worked out is another matter.  The Deputy said he hoped the Green Paper would examine many of those issues.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGinley spoke on the need to have a qualification in Irish to enter the University of Limerick.  That is not now compulsory for that university.  Perhaps there is a need to look at the requirements for students entering into teacher training in the university, where it would be necessary.  Deputy Mac Giolla in relation to another section wanted to know what strictures or conditions the Minister could lay down.  Perhaps that could be covered there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an ongoing debate about the teaching of languages in primary schools. We hear about requests for the teaching <Col N="769" /> of German, French, Spanish or Italian and it is often said that we are behind the rest of Europe in teaching languages in our schools.  I recall Deputy Garret FitzGerald saying here that we were behind the countries of Europe in the range of languages we provided to primary schools.  Subsequently I did some delving and found that we are not behind.  Most countries in Europe teach two languages, just as we do, and only two teach three. We teach two languages at primary level from the very beginning.  As Deputy Mac Giolla said there is a need to examine the content of the curriculum for teacher training in relation to Irish.  The fact that we teach two languages from an early stage leaves people ready to absorb a third or a fourth language later on.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their comments and I suggest that we agree to the composite motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for elucidating this section.  Níor mhaith liom scoilt a bheith againn faoi cheist na Gaeilge.  Ceann de na deacrachtaí agus na fadhbanna ba mhó ná an méid scoilteanna a bhí againn ó thaobh na Gaeilge de le linn stair na tíre seo.  We should not divide on this.  It is not my wish to push my amendment to a vote but to simply use it as a vehicle for debate. I am reassured by what the Minister said.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kemmy asked me to elaborate in relation to administration.  When I talk about administration I mean having the language spoken and heard within the college as much as possible and about the availability of the language to someone who goes to an administration desk seeking clarification on some point through the medium of Irish.  I am talking about a basic competence in the language.  For example, if someone goes to a public health dentist that person has the right to have his tooth pulled through Irish, as it were.  The Ceard Teastas is a requirement for somebody taking up employment with the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister refers to the promotion and use of the Irish language I <Col N="770" /> presume she is talking about the administrative use of the language.  The Minister might clarify that.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Shea I dislike an element of compulsion, particularly when it is aggressive compulsion.  Compulsion had done much to damage the respect for the language over the years. It has led to a distaste among children for the language when they should have a natural love for it.  What Deputy Mac Giolla said in relation to the decline in the standard is true.  One of the most retrograde steps in relation to the welfare of the language was the abolition of the preparatory colleges where Irish was the spoken medium within the college.  Even though we train our primary teachers to a level higher than in many other countries, unfortunately that is not true when it comes to our language.</P>
    <P>There is the option fortunately now in Mary Immaculate in Limerick, in St. Patrick's in Drumcondra, in Froebel and in Rathmines to do the language <i>per se</i> or to do a theoretical treatment of the language.  Unfortunately it is not the vehicle of communication within any of the colleges.  There is a less than adequate standard.  I very much welcome the development of the Gaelscoileanna. They are a great innovation and are doing a lot in a practical way to nurture a love and respect for the use of the language.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mac Giolla says, we have two levels of Irish.  There are people who are extremely competent and others who have a nominal knowledge of the language rather than a day to day competence in its use.  I agree with Deputy McGinley that it should be possible to have a greater co-existence of the two languages.  I take the Minister's point that we teach two languages.  It should be possible to achieve the use of the two languages and we should try to work towards this with as little compulsion as possible and more exhortation.</P>
    <P>The debate on this section has thrown up the need for a further debate in the House in relation to the Irish language. Ceapaim go bhfuil gá le díospóireacht níos forleithne a bheith againn sar i bhfad ar staid na Gaeilge féin.</P>

      <P>Administration was clarified as relating to the every day activities of the college.  Deputy Higgins pointed to the Ceard Teastais and referred to the fact that that certificate extended to health bords.  How pervasive Irish becomes in the conduct of public business will be a matter for scrutiny and follow through in the colleges.  Deputy Higgins suggested a full scale Dáil debate or a nationwide debate on the state of the language.  That and in-service training have emerged as the two themes being debated here this morning.

It is well we have public accountability in respect of this legislation because we vote a lot of money through every year, as Deputy Higgins said, for third level education.  It should be fully discussed in this House and all opinions are equal.</P>
      <P>I hope that the ethos and spirit of this debate will be translated to the campus in Limerick and that the tolerance and consensus among Members will mean agreement in the college.  The debate on Irish culture and language has been very good.  Kate O'Brien is the only writer commemorated in a tower in the University of Limerick and many other writers, poets and scholars deserve to be commemorated also that the ethos lives on in a physical and tangible way.  Gerald Griffin, our novelist and poet, deserves to be commemorated in the new university and the same applies to John Francis O'Donnell and other poets and writers. Michael Hogan, the Bard of Thomond and the De Veres should also be commemorated. Eugene O'Currie came from neighbouring County Clare and even though his colleague, John Donovan, did not come from the area, they both made a tremendous contribution to Irish culture and deserve to be commemorated in the university.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to him. <Col N="773" /> Brian Merriman died in Limerick in the 19th century.  He was a school teacher and grew flax and is associated with <i>Midnight Court</i>, infamously or notoriously. However, Brian Merriman was a great scholar and deserves to be commemorated. Seán Ó Tuama and Andrias McGrath who composed Limericks also deserve to be commemorated.  I would not turn up my nose at a Limerick, bawdy or otherwise; as far as I am concerned anything should go in a university to foster the free spirit about which we spoke earlier.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, has been here for the debate.  I am sure he would be interested in commemorating Bob Tisdall who won an Olympic gold medal for Ireland in 1932.  Ronnie Delaney, Eamon Coughlan and Marcus O'Sullivan should also be commemorated.  I know that the Minister of State did not get a chance to say much today, nevertheless, he is responsible for ensuring that our writers, poets and athletes are commemorated.  We represent the public, this is public money and we must influence the Government.  I do not want to do this in an arrogant way or through the use of &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; because the spirit of freedom must exist in every academic institution, but we have knowledge of the university of life.  One track should certainly be called after Bob Tisdall.</P>
      <P>This has been a healthy debate and I hope the Minister will take on board our suggestions.  There has been a marvellous consensus among all parties in the House in relation to this issue, long may that continue.  Education generally has been a battleground in the past because of vested interests but I hope that day has gone.  I believe in saying things in the open, not lobbying the Minister behind closed doors and trying to manoeuvre in an undemocratic way.  Education is a public domain and we are entitled to make decisions in this House.  If other people want to influence us they should write to us and we will put their point of view in this House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) An order under subsection (1) may as respects the repeal effected by <Col N="776" /> section 22 of the provisions of the Act of 1972 fix different days for the repeal of different provisions of that Act or for the repeal for different purposes of any provision of that Act.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This amendment, and the other Government amendment, No. 85, taken together are designed to make certain that the repeals provided for in section 22 can take place on a phased basis.  In particular they will enable the Minister to keep a particular restrictive practices order and enforcement provisions for as long as is felt necessary.  The issue which underlies the sections is whether the groceries order should be repealed.  I want to make it clear that there is no question of that order, which has given rise to some representations, being repealed immediately. There will be a transitional period. As I made clear already, the precise extent of the transitional period will depend on what the Fair Trade Commission say in their report on the review of the order and on how well the Bill operates in practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission in their report on competition policy suggested that two restrictive practices orders needed to be retained, namely, the groceries order and the motor spirits order.  However, in their report on the supply and distribution of motor spirits which was published on 6 May last the Fair Trade Commission stated that they were satisfied that the operation of competition legislation would obviate the need for a new motor spirits order and recommended that the existing order be revoked.  The Fair Trade Commission's report on their review of the groceries order is awaited. It is expected that this report will be submitted to me during the summer.  It is proposed that the decision on the timing of the revocation of that order, if that were decided on, be postponed until consideration is given to the Fair Trade Commission's recommendations and account is taken of what they have to say.  Sections 2 and 22 of the Bill which are now being amended will empower the Minister to phase in the repeal of the parent Act and the orders made thereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say any more about this matter except to emphasise that these amendments make it abundantly clear that each individual order made under the 1972 Act can be treated separately.  There was a possibility under the Bill as originally drafted that all of them would have had to be taken together.  These two amendments make it abundantly clear that each individual order made under the 1972 Act can be revoked separately or if it is so decided as a matter of policy not to revoke a particular order that order need <Col N="778" /> not or will not be revoked.  The amendments make it clear that that can be done. This relates in particular to the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, about which there is some controversy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has made that last point about individual orders because I think it needed clarification and his amendment No. 85 does that.  The Minister's amendment No. 1 will not have the same effects as my amendment No. 86 because he appears to be qualifying the provision whereas my amendment states specifically:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987... is not repealed by virtue of this section or any other section of this Act. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what the Minister has said here this morning he intends that his will be a temporary measure whereas mine is a permanent measure and proposes that the Groceries Order should be a permanent part of the legislation of this House.  It is fair to say that there was concern in some quarters when it was introduced originally but in the past three years it has served both the business community and the consumers extremely well.  It is a fact that the cost of food in particular has not risen as fast as the consumer price index.  As well as that the order has had the effect of revitalising many of the smaller towns and the suburbs of larger towns because smaller traders have had the confidence to invest knowing they would not be put out of business by unfair practices and below cost selling by bigger supermarket chains who could afford in limited instances to carry loss leaders in order to gain a more dominant position in the market, and when the smaller shopkeeper was forced out of business they could adjust their prices accordingly.  Cases were quoted where such incidents happened.  One can give numerous examples, the most recent being the issuing of a £5 voucher when one spent a certain amount in the supermarkets in Tallaght before Christmas last.  I know also of cases where drink prices were cut to such an extent by the <Col N="779" /> large supermarket chains in the period before Christmas that the specialist businesses such as off-licences were forced to close down after Christmas.  The loss incurred by cutting the price of drink could be offset by the increased profits in other areas of the supermarket and this has helped to eliminate competition in sectors of the trade.  These were the kinds of considerations that prompted the Minister of the day to introduce the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order in 1987 and I believe it should not be repealed even on a temporary basis.  It appears that the Minister intends to look at this again when the Fair Trade Commission report on the grocery trade in July.  Let me say however that the Fair Trade Commission reported on competition last December 12 months and it was quite extraordinary that we saw no sign of that report until, coincidentally, this Bill was published in April of this year.  At the same time, the Fair Trade Commission are conducting an investigation into the sector that has the highest profile in regard to competition, the grocery trade, but they will not be reporting on it until mid summer.  Yet, without that report, we are being asked to debate this Competition Bill into an element of competition that affects a wide part of business and every consumer in the country.  It is like cycling with only one pedal on the bicycle.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept my amendment No. 86 instead of basing his decision on the report of the Fair Trade Commission in July.  As I have said, the 1987 Order has served the interests of the consumer and of small businesses very well.  It would be an unhappy day if any action in this House were to drive out small businesses and concentrate trade in the grocery sector, in particular, in the hands of a few more powerful operators. For that reason I suggest that the Minister accepts my amendment in place of his own which would allow him to repeal the order at a later date should he so decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise one point with the Minister.  I am generally in <Col N="780" /> sympathy with his commitment not to repeal the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 at this stage but could he be more specific?  Can he tell us also if he will be influenced to so repeat it on the basis of the Fair Trade Commission study?  I mention this point as the Minister has said he would want to see the operation of the Act in practice.  I wonder how realistic it is to have that as the yardstick of measurement because if the groceries order remains in vogue the operation of the Act will not be much of a guideline when the Order is still there as it will determine various matters that would otherwise have to be determined by the operation of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be disposed to accepting Deputy Barry's amendment No. 86 for the simple reason that it is in black and white terms and does not take any account of what might happen in the future, both so far as any possible recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission are concerned or any possible changes in business practices within that particular trade.  The reason I believe that the way I am proposing to deal with the matter in my amendment is better than what Deputy Barry proposes is that it may well be that the Fair Trade Commission, for example, would recommend the retention of the existing order with amendments and it would not be possible to make those amendments if we had the type of provision Deputy Barry is suggesting, which is that the 1987 order as drafted and passed in 1987 be retained permanently and be frozen in the terms of 1987.  The way I am suggesting the matter be dealt with under amendments Nos. 1 and 85 allows a certain flexibility. If, for example, the Fair Trade Commission were to recommend the repeal of the order after a particular time, what I am proposing would allow that to be done if it was decided to do so, or if the Commission recommended amendments, it would allow the amendments to be made and that might well be appropriate. It would be wrong to think that the commission's views on these matters are as set out in their report of early 1990 <Col N="781" /> on competition policy generally because Members will recall the publication a couple of months ago of a report on the motor spirit trade where they recommended the repeal of the order in question; and I have accepted that recommendation subject to this Bill being passed and the repeal not coming into effect until the Bill is up and running. That is what the Commission feel is appropriate.</P>
      <P>There is a danger, which I am sure Deputy Barry will recognise, that the 1987 order will go out of date.  It would be wrong to have it frozen in the terms as drafted in 1987.  It would be better to have flexibility to make amendments, if necessary.  It would also be wrong for this House to make up its mind finally and definitively in regard to the regulation of the grocery trade when we are awaiting with some interest a report by the commission on the grocery trade.  They recently completed the taking of evidence from quite a number of interested parties whose points of view they will have to evaluate before reaching a conclusion. I hope to hear from them during the summer.  It would be wrong not to allow ourselves the flexiblity to consider the Fair Trade Commission's report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point the Minister is making but there is not an exact comparison with the petroleum order.  The grocery issue is quite separate.  The point about the 1987 Act is that if there were no Competition Bill before this House and the Fair Trade Commission recommended changes, presumably the Minister would amend that Act on the basis of their recommendation.  The position there does not change.  The Competition Bill takes power away from this House and gives it to the Minister.  If the Minister proposes to amend the 1987 Act he should bring his proposals before this House.  The Minister's amendment No. 1 allows him to make changes without coming back to the House.  I suggest that the 1987 Act should be left as it is and if the Fair Trade Commission make recommendations which the Minister accepts he will have to come back to this House <Col N="782" /> and argue for those changes.  Under the terms of his amendment he can do so by ministerial order without coming back to the House.</P>

      <P>With respect, Deputy Barry is under a misapprehension under two headings.  It is not strictly correct to refer to the 1987 Act since it is an order which was subsequently confirmed by an Act.  We are talking about an order made by the Minister and subsequently confirmed. If it were proposed to amend the 1987 order the Minister would have to come to the House anyway because he would make an order amending it but it would not have effect until confirmed by the Oireachtas under the 1972 legislation, which would remain in force for this purpose under sections 2 and 22 as amended on the lines I am suggesting.  It will have to come back anyway.  The House is not deprived of the opportunity to express views on it.</P>

      <P>We have spent a fair amount of time on Deputy Barry's amendment No. 86 and I wonder if it achieves very much.  It seems to contain a declaratory statement rather than achieve anything specific.  It simply states that the order is not repealed by virtue of this section.  Even without the amendment, the order is not repealed.  The insertion of the Deputy's amendment would not achieve or alter anything very much.  Perhaps I am misreading it but I do not think it will affect any future action of the Minister.  The amendment does not purport to provide that the order shall not be repealed at some future date except by adopting a particular procedure.  It is a declaratory statement which is obviously correct anyway.  It does not add to or detract from the position one iota.</P>

This is a declaratory statement that says the order is not repealed by virtue of this section but it does not say that the Minister may not revoke the order at any stage in the future if he is so minded.  Is all this debate getting us somewhere?  We can anticipate that perhaps the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission will cause an amendment to be made and in that event it will have to come before the House anyway, but in the event that it does not, I do not see the enactment of this particular subsection preventing the Minister revoking the order at some future stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> In page 3, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Part II of the Act shall not be brought into operation until the Competition Authority has been established and operating for a period of at least six months during which time the Authority will issue guidelines on this Act and on its own procedures and also has issued the areas to which block exemptions for categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices will apply.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment dealt with the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.  Because of the lack of consultation by the Department with the various interests concerned leading up to the publication of this Bill, because the Fair Trade Commission report on Competition Policy and the Bill were both published at about the same time, and because of the huge amount of work required to comply with the terms of this Bill when it is passed, I suggest that it would not be unreasonable that the Act should not be brought into operation until the competition authority has been established for a period of at least six months during which time the authority would issue guidelines on this legislation, on its own procedures, on the various areas to which block exemptions would apply and on categories of agreements, decisions and practices to which it will apply.  The part I wish to see postponed is Part II relating to the rules of competition, anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices.  There are four or five sections of decisions that need to be gone through.  Up to a month ago, nobody had sight of this Bill and there is a huge amount of work to be done by lawyers, small businesses, accountants, etc., before they can decide whether they do comply with the Bill. What I am suggesting is that after the competition authority is established &mdash; and I presume that will be in a short period of time&mdash;there should be a period of six months during which people who are affected by this Bill will have a chance to study its implications.  Indeed, the <Col N="787" /> authority itself, which presumably will be neutral, will have to draw up certain guidelines and rules for firms who may have to comply or apply for exemptions under the Bill.  They should have time to study the Bill and its implications before they are actually affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of my amendment No. 2.  I hope I have explained how it is different from amendment No. 1.  I am looking for a commitment from the Minister that would allow people to study the Bill.  Every undertaking in the country is affected by this Bill and all of them have to decide whether they are affected by the Bill and they will all have to take advice according to the guidelines laid down by the authority.  There should, therefore, be a breathing space between the enactment of the Bill and the coming into effect after the authority is established of the measures contained in the Bill.  I do not think it is unreasonable to suggest that a period of at least six months should elapse between those two occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of Deputy Barry's amendment would be to ensure that Part II of the Bill did not come into force for at least six months and that during that time the authority would issue guidelines.  If Part II were not in force when the Bill was passed there could be no notifications to it and accordingly there could be no decisions by the authority. In particular, there could be no block exemptions, which is one of the things Deputy Barry suggests should apply.  It would not be possible to do that if Part II were not in.  The best guidelines that the authority can provide are decisons on real as opposed to theoretical cases.  The competition authority therefore needs to operate with notifications and Part II generally must come into force as soon as is practicable after the passing of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill allows the phased introduction of provisions and consideration will be given as to how this can best be done.  The rigid approach inherent in the proposed amendment <Col N="788" /> strikes me as not being appropriate.  In particular, the Deputy should bear in mind that section 7 (2) of the Bill gives one year for existing agreements to be notified, which is twice as long as the period he mentions here.  I think that will meet the point he makes in relation to companies that are potentially covered by the Bill and will need some period to adjust.  Under section 7 they have up to a year to make the notification.  It is during that period too that the competition authority will draw rules which will exclude certain small categories of agreements that would not have much effect on competition. For example, they will have to apply a <i>de minimus</i> rule but I am not trying to set out here in legislation what would be an appropriate definition of <i>de minimus</i> because it would not be appropriate to do it.  It is better to let the authority have the jurisdiction to make their own rules in that regard.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to operate as closely as we can to the European system by analogy with Articles 85 and 86 and how that is applied and, of course, the Deputy and the House will be aware that those Articles in the Treaty do not give detailed rules; the rules are made by the Commission. It is best that that sort of lead be followed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party's general position on this Bill is that there are many defects in it.  I am not too sure it is going to achieve what it sets out to achieve but, generally speaking, if we do not go down the American road of the anti-trust legislation we must go for the European system the Minister suggested. Therefore, we agree with the thrust of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in all the circumstances of how this Bill appeared it is not fair to consider Deputy Barry's amendment as unreasonable.  I have the impression that business and industry have been taken somewhat by surprise and have only recently been alerted to the implications and significance of the Bill.  I do not know about other Deputies, but I received the <Col N="789" /> views of the CII on the matter only yesterday. It seems there are many implications and areas that are vague in terms of the advice one could give to industry when preparing for this Bill and require further study and time for analysis.  For example, the Minister announced only in his Second Stage speech that the Fair Trade Commission report on competition policy had been published.  As I remarked on Second Stage, I had sought that report a month earlier and it was not available. Therefore, for legislation that will have ramifications as wide as the Minister suggests there is an argument to be made to allow business time to prepare a more considered view.</P>
    <P>I am not saying the Minister should necessarily take on board everything the CII, RGDATA or any other body suggest, but, from reading press comment on it recently and comments from the CII, it appears that business is only now alerted to the possible implications.  That has been a feature of legislation during this term.  We have got very little time to get the gen on important legislation coming before the House.  Having regard to the extent of other burdens one must carry as a Deputy, it is very difficult to have prepared in the manner one would like.  There are precedents in the House for key regulations made under a particular Act not being implemented for months or longer after the Act has been enacted.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the six months' respite Deputy Barry is seeking can be seen as unreasonable.  I wonder whether it is fair to say a great deal of the work could not go on anyway even if Part II was postponed.  The Minister mentioned in passing that he reckoned the competition authority would have to look at the introduction of a <i>de minimis</i> rule.  That issue was raised by the CII.  I am not always in favour of such a recommendation.  In the area of disclosure of information that kind of regulation, by setting a threshold of employees, turnover or whatever the criterion is, has been used by many companies to avoid obligations of disclosure of information to employees and so on. Nonetheless, it seems practical in this <Col N="790" /> situation that some <i>de minimis</i> regulation will have to be considered.  Surely that is the kind of thing a new authority could proceed with, and, for the sake of six months to enable interested parties to respond to this legislation, no damage would be done if they were given that kind of respite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to a point I sympathise with what Deputy Barry is trying to achieve, but I do not think it would be realistic or necessary to set up the competition authority and have them doing I do not know exactly what for six months before the meat and bones of the Bill, namely Part II, is brought into operation. Section 4 (1) deals with concerted practices that are prohibited and so on.  I do not see that any six months' respite is necessary.  That kind of activity is reprehensible. It is being made unlawful and should not be taking place now whether the Bill is passed or not.  I do not see a further six months' respite on that line as necessary or appropriate.  They should be toeing the line on those issues right away without waiting for the Bill to become law.</P>
      <P>On the issues of categories, agreements and such matters perhaps there is something to be said for it but, again, I sympathise with the Minister's position. It is difficult to know whether it will be possible in the abstract, as it were, for the authority to give guidelines on what sort of concerted agreements they might license or not accept.  Once we make the decision that the Bill is appropriate it might be better to get on with it as speedily as possible.  As the Minister indicated, he has the power to introduce certain parts of the Bill on a phased basis.  No doubt he, and his officials, will look at how that can best be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The message of the Bill is going to have to be brought home forcibly and quickly enough to those companies and institutions who are practising abuse on these issues.  They will have to get the message and apply themselves to what is required of them under the Bill.  Let us not fall over too much to sympathise with those <Col N="791" /> companies.  They are rich, powerful institutions. They have at their command resources, professional advice, experts, lawyers, accountants and so on.  I would not be at all surprised if many of their experts and professionals are burning the midnight oil to see if there is any way they can get around the Bill and continue with some of their more undesirable practices that have made this Bill so necessary. I do not think we need sympathise with them all that much.  We are dealing with powerful institutions who are well able to apply themselves to this kind of problem.  It will be a problem for some of them and rightly so.</P>
    <P>While I understand what Deputy Barry is about, I do not think his amendments are necessary.  It would be better that the provisions of the Bill be put into operation as quickly as possible.  The Minister should be cautious about using the powers he has to delay the coming into operation of various provisions of it. They should all be up and running as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor said he understands what I am trying to do.  From his contribution I do not think he does. In a fine emotional speech he talked about big industries with endless resources at their disposal doing all this work and having accountants and lawyers looking into the implications of the Bill for them.  However, they are not the people I am talking about.  I am talking about the small concerns who have none of these facilities and are still caught by this Bill.  Any corner shop is in theory responsible under this Bill because there is no <i>de minimis</i> clause in it.  The Minister has said, and this is the first time I have heard it said, that his intention was that the authority should introduce a <i>de minimis</i> rule, but that is one very good reason for waiting for the bringing into effect of this Bill until firms who may feel they have to make inquiries, hire lawyers and accountants to see whether they are affected by the Bill, find, because of the very small size of their operations, they <Col N="792" /> are not affected by the Bill.  That is quite reasonable.</P>
      <P>Responding to my opening proposal the Minister said that as far as practical it should be brought in after the authority are set up.  I agree with that.  That is precisely the spirit behind my amendment. I am saying that as far as practical a six month period is reasonable to allow the authority see what is the practical <i>de minimis</i> rule.  It should be brought in in this instance so that the firms will be in a position to know whether they are affected by the Competition Bill.  If they are not affected, they will not have to bear the further cost of making an application seeking an exemption.  Of course, the major firms to which Deputy Taylor referred will have to immediately start working on their applications if they have to apply for an exemption.  They will have to get the best advice possible, and they have the resources to do that.</P>
      <P>We all agree with the thrust of the Bill but we are concerned to ensure that it will be workable.  As Deputy Rabbitte rightly said, the Fair Trade Commission's report on competition was evidently in the Department of Industry and Commerce and with the Minister for 18 months.  However, the report was not made available to the people who would be affected by a competition Bill.  Even if the draft Bill at the back of the report had been made available to the industry during those 18 months so that they could make representations to the Minister, it would have been some help.  However, the first time we saw the Fair Trade Commission's report or the Bill was less than a month ago.  All commercial undertakings had to gear themselves to find out whether they will be affected by the Bill before the authority who will lay down the rules is set up.  The Minister said the Bill should be bought into force as soon as practicable.  I do not think it is unreasonable to suggest that the phrase &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; should be interpreted as a certain period of, say, six months, before this section, which is the effective section so far as industry is concerned, comes into play.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal first with the points made by Deputy Rabbitte.  He suggested that all this was entirely new so far as industry, the CII and those whom they represent are concerned. Of course, that is not so.  The traded sector in Irish industry have had to deal with Articles 85 and 86 since 1 January 1973, whether or not they liked it.  It did not have much effect on many of them and those it did effect adapted pretty quickly to it; it is really common sense and operates fairly smoothly.  Therefore, a great many of them are familiar with what is required and, perhaps more importantly, are familiar with what is not allowed.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned that the Fair Trade Commission report on competition was published on 16 April, the Bill was presented to the House on 12 April and the Bill and the report were published together on 16 April.  I gave a press conference that day drawing attention to both the Bill and the report and there was plenty of opportunity for those who had an interest in the matter to study it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the <i>de minimis</i> question, the authority would need to see the notifications in order to make proper judgments on these rules.  The rules are not like the rules on, for example takeovers where there are thresholds in terms of employees, assets or turnsover.  This would not be appropriate in this case and this is why it is not wise to try to lay down the rules which will have to be laid down in this House.  The authority will be seeking to exclude activities which do not have any real influence on competition. One cannot define that in terms of, for example, turn-over, assets or employees. A different form of definition will have to be worked out in practice over a period of time.  In addition, the rules will vary from sector to sector.  One cannot assume that because a particular level is appropriate in one sector a similar level is appropriate somewhere else.  It might be very much bigger or smaller as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry said that small businesses might be caught by this Bill.  No businesses will be caught by the Bill; what <Col N="794" /> will be caught are agreements which businesses, big or small, enter into which are anti-competitive or restrictive in nature or concerted practices.  It is those agreements and practices and not the ordinary day-to-day running of a business which will be caught.  If you do not enter into restrictive agreements of that kind, then the Bill will not affect you.  The Bill relates only to these matters.  Therefore, the Bill will not of itself be a matter of day-to-day concern for businesses, big or small, except in so far as they enter into various forms of prohibitive practices and agreements or seek to abuse a dominant position in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that people are only now beginning to realise the significance of the Bill.  This was one of the most signalled Bills over the 21 months before it was published.  I made about 12 speeches on the principles of the Bill and the Bill is in accord with what I said in those speeches.  I signalled the Bill very clearly.  Since the Bill was published both I and officials of my Department have had a large number of consultations with various interests who expressed their views on the Bill.  A number of seminars have been held on the Bill during which all aspects have been gone into in some detail.</P>
    <P>I want to come back again to the point that if I were to exclude Part II of the Bill I might as well not bring in the Bill at all. Part II is the kernel of the Bill and the competition authority could not operate in a vacuum without Part II.  For example, they could not draw up rules and so on.  The notifications, etc will have to be made to enable them to operate.</P>
    <P>So far as existing agreements and concerted practices are concerned, under section 7 (2) businesses will have 12 months and not six months, as Deputy Barry seeks, to notify to the authority. This is a very generous transition period for them.  Given the abuses we know exist, it would be wrong not to bring the provisions in sections 4 and 5 which prohibit these practices into effect now. I do not think these provisions will create undue difficulties simply because something is somewhat different or new.  This <Col N="795" /> can frighten people sometimes but it is not all that new and a great many Irish firms in the traded sector have already operated without any major problems under the system since 1973.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion made by Deputy Barry that the small corner shop could be caught and affected in a material way by the Bill, I cannot see how this would happen.  Sections 4 and 5 refer to distortion of competition in trade in any goods and services.  I cannot see how any corner shop could be involved in causing distortion in trade or directly or indirectly fixing a purchaser's selling price or any other trading conditions. What small corner shop would get involved in activities such as limiting or controlling production or markets, sharing markets or sources of supply?  Deputy Barry's suggestion is not realistic.  We are talking in the main here about major firms which are capable of coping with this Bill.  As I said, they should have been complying with the guidelines set out therein anyway and if they have not been, the sooner they are brought to book the better.  I would not support the idea of giving them an imprimator to carry on with their activities for a further six months from the time the Bill is belatedly brought in.</P>

      <P>In recent debates in the Seanad on the Local Government Bill, the Minister for the Environment indicated that he would take up with the National Archives the question of the application of the National Archives Act to local authority records.  The director of the National Archives is now considering, in conjunction with officers of my Department and the Department of the Environment, the measures which might be taken to ensure the better preservation of local authority records.</P>
      <P>One of the statutory functions of the director of the National Archives is the giving of advice to local authorities and other public service organisations on the management, preservation and reproduction of records under their control. Accordingly, the director has prepared a circular entitled &ldquo;The National Archives Act and the Records of Local and Regional Public Bodies&rdquo; and this has been circulated to local authorities.  The director of the National Archives is also organising a seminar later this year for county secretaries on the subject of local authority archives.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, under the statute, the application would have to be to the Taoiseach.  What would happen is <Col N="798" /> that if the Taoiseach declared, under the statute, that they were departmental records then, in all probability, he would also declare that some local place must be the archival record place.  In other words, it would be likely that they would be preserved at local level.  On the question of staff, I would imagine that with the assistance of the director of National Archives most librarians would be in a position to do the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion referred to by the Deputy, I stated as I have on a number of previous occasions, that the common membership of both parts of Ireland and of Britain in the European Community places the Northern Ireland problem in an entirely new and more hopeful context.  I went on to say that the progress towards political union and economic and monetary union will mean that before the end of the century, all Irishmen and women, North and South, will be fellow citizens of a united Europe. I also emphasised that our guiding principle must be the concept of mutual benefit so as to ensure that Ireland, North and South, gains the maximum possible advantage from the benefits of European integration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he would agree that there are no proposals at Community level to change the borders of any of the member states of the European Community and that there would be resistance from virtually every state within the European Community if any such proposal was made? Can he indicate, therefore, that while there will certainly be a unity of the Irish people as there will be of all the people of the European Community in terms of economy and monetary matters, the political borders of the European Community will remain the same for the foreseeable future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is <Col N="800" /> any doubt about that.  We are all committed to preservation of existing boundaries except in so far as they are changeable by consent.  The CSCE Treaty, for instance, makes specific provision for the changing of boundaries by consent.  What I have been talking about in the various statements I referred to is the question of the economic realities. The economic border between the North and South of Ireland will become quite meaningless under economic and monetary union.  All the citizens of Europe, including Irish people North and South, will share a common currency, the same sort of economic policies, they will elect Members to the European Parliament and they will increasingly become citizens of an integrated Europe.  In fact, as the Deputy is aware, there is a concept now on the table in Community discussions for European citizenship which is beginning to take shape.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Taoiseach has said in regard to the future development of European citizenship but in the course of his speech he indicated that he considered the current political division in Ireland to be an artificial division. Does that imply that he does not regard the political differences that exist within the island of Ireland as real, that they do not arise from different sets of allegiances?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is reading all sorts of unnecessary implications into what is a very simple, practical, common sense statement.  I do not think I ever spoke in any of those statements about the political boundaries, I was careful not to.  I was talking about the economic boundaries, the economic divisions.  I said that increasingly the movement towards economic and monetary union in Europe would make those out of date, that we would all be existing under the same type of monetary and economic policies.</P>

In view of that, would the Taoiseach agree that it would be useful if the Council of Europe was encouraged to engage in more research into the resolution of majority-minority situations where two groups occupy a similar territory, which applies right across central Europe as well as in Ireland?

      <P>There was no detailed discussion on this topic at the meeting to which the Deputy refers.  In continued discussions of this matter by the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union Ireland's position will largely be influenced by the contents of the agreed statement on Community &ldquo;Industrial policy in an open and competitive environment&rdquo; which was agreed by the Industry Council meeting on 26 November 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach support the concept of incorporating a reference to industrial policy in any proposed new treaty or in amendments to the existing treaty?  I am sure <Col N="803" /> the Taoiseach will agree that the current unemployment crisis in Ireland cannot be solved on its own and, that there has to be a European dimension to whatever steps we take to resolve that crisis.  Surely a specific reference to an industrial policy in the treaty would ensure that there is a commitment at European level to deal with such problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

May I ask the Taoiseach if, in his view, it would be important for the European Community to develop an interventionist approach with regard to industrial policy? To simply allow the market to operate freely without some intervention would mean that jobs would be created at the centre and not at the economic periphery where we are situated.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to elaborate on this matter, but may I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that the Commission paper which the Council agreed on 26 November is clearly a non-interventionist approach to industrial policy and that regional and structural funding <Col N="804" /> on its own, while it may create the conditions for job creation or job location in Ireland, will not result in job creation here unless there is a specific policy by the European Community to directly become involved in directing investment towards Ireland?

      <P>The Community is firmly committed to the concept of a free market.

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree it is ridiculous that rich countries in Europe pay substantial grants to industry to attract them away from the peripheral regions, as witness the Belgians, the Dutch and the Germans?

While we might get a commitment in theory to social and economic cohesion, if industrial policy does not direct industrial development and job creation towards Ireland and other peripheral regions, social cohesion will not take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>A report entitled <i>Urban Poverty, the Economy and Public Policy</i> was published by the Combat Poverty Agency on 20 May 1991.  The statistical information concerning poverty rates included in the report relates in the case of Ireland to 1973, 1980 and 1985.  The significant improvements we have made during the past four years in the rates of social welfare payments are not reflected in the statistical analysis in the report.</P>
      <P>For example, in the period July 1987 to July 1991 the personal rate of long term unemployment assistance increased by over 45 per cent.  This is an increase of 27.5 per cent in real terms.  In the same period, the rate payable to a married couple on the short term rate of unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance increased by 41 per cent, almost 24 per cent in real terms.</P>
      <P>This year we have again provided special increases to those on the lower rates of payments.  The personal rates of short term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance are being increased by over 11 per cent.  Families on these payments will receive increases of over 9 per cent.  Families of those on unemployment benefit and disability benefit will also receive increases ranging up to 7 per cent.  These increases take effect from next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> The key issue arising from the report referred to is the need for an integrated approach in tackling the problems of disadvantaged communities and particularly the problem of long term unemployment. The value of an integrated approach of this nature was also stressed in the NESC report entitled, <i>A Strategy for the Nineties.</i></P>
    <P>The need for such an integrated approach is in keeping with the Government's area based response to long term unemployment as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> This innovative approach in combating long term unemployment complements initiatives which I have already taken in introducing greater flexibility in the unemployment payment system and in the area of community development.  We now have 705 long term unemployed people doing full-time second chance education programmes.</P>
    <P>The Government's new strategy is area based.  Local communities are the prime movers.  They will integrate with initiatives already in place, including the educational initiatives which I have introduced over the past few years.  The strategy will involve a progression, in particular to ensuring second-chance education, leading to qualifications and therefore a greater possibility of a job.</P>
    <P>Under this programme, which is already under way, a series of pilot projects will be carried out this year in 12 areas.  These areas were selected on the basis of recommendations made by the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  A national level team representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the employer organisations, FÁS and the Departments of Education, Social Welfare and the Taoiseach has been established to organise the project and to monitor and co-ordinate the activities of individual local companies.  These companies, which are being set up to co-ordinate the response in each of the 12 areas, will be representative of the local <Col N="810" /> community interests, public agencies and the social partners.</P>
    <P>The pilot projects will be reviewed at the end of the year.  On the basis of this review, satisfactory models will progressively be extended nationwide by 1994.  The suggestions contained in the report can contribute to the implementation of the new area based response strategy.</P>
    <P>A number of the pilot areas selected under the area based strategy to combat long term unemployment also contain community development projects which are being funded by my Department under the nationwide programme of community development, which I introduced last year.</P>
    <P>Under the programme, grants are being made to local projects to establish local resource centres which are designed to act as a focal point for community development initiatives.  A key feature of the programme is that the participating projects have security of funding for a three-year period.  This year the Government provided an additional £225,000 for the programme, bringing the overall allocation in 1991 to £750,000.  These additional resources are being used to provide increased funds to the existing 15 participating projects and to extend the programme to other areas.  A new project in the Bray area was launched recently and work on establishing projects in Darndale in north Dublin and in Waterford city is at an advanced stage.  In addition, plans to establish other projects in Kilkenny and west Cork are being finalised</P>
    <P>In general, the projects being funded under the programme receive grants of £40,000 per year and a special allocation of £100,000 per year is being made to a project in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the best approach to tackling the problems of disadvantaged communities is through developing and enhancing integrated approaches such as those which I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Given that 200,000 people have emigrated since the period covered by <Col N="811" /> the report and that Ireland now has the highest number of long term unemployed ever recorded, will the Minister not accept the findings of the report and that the trend shown between 1973 and 1985 is continuing up to 1991?  Will he not admit that Ireland now has the worst poverty rate in Europe and that that position is getting worse, given the rate of emigration and the numbers of long term unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that the figures relate to 1973, 1980 and 1985, before the period of the present Government. In fact, the Deputy is now a member of a party who were in Government at that time.  The Deputy should note the exact level at which payments stood in 1986, when the Labour Party left Government, and what has happened since then.  There has been a substantial increase in unemployment payments, and I mentioned that in relation to the figures provided.  Even though the numbers increased &mdash; particularly because of difficulties in Great Britain, the United States and Australia; there is no question that more people are returning to Ireland and fewer people are emigrating &mdash; the rates per head have increased.  That has meant substantial additional allocations to those who depend on unemployment payments.  A very useful fact sheet gives detailed information on what has been done since the publication of the figures in the report.  I wish to emphasise that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to point out that the main finding of the report was that economic growth on its own will not automatically eliminate urban poverty, and that is something that I know very well.  The first proposal made for tackling the problem was for training targeted at the abilities of local workers and the kind of jobs likely to be available in local areas. Through the Jobsearch programme in 1987 and other initiatives since then the Government have directed additional training opportunities and additional second-chance educational opportunities <Col N="812" /> to people in those circumstances.  I agree with that finding and with several other findings in relation to the best way to tackle the problem.  The one point made generally is that an integrated approach is required, which is exactly what the Government are doing with the social partners, through the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  People should give that programme an opportunity to operate, because it has only been accepted.  It has already come into operation in a number of areas.  It is coming into operation now and it will bear the fruits people expect from it.</P>

I can reassure the Deputy, however, that where an over-payment arises through no fault of a social welfare recipient, a very sympathetic attitude is taken towards recovery of the amounts over-paid and all the circumstances of the case are taken into account.  Such recoveries are made with the agreement of the recipient and every effort is made to ensure that hardship is not caused.</P>

      <P>Sympathy is one <Col N="815" /> thing, but when the Department make a mistake they should accept responsibility for it.  I know of a person who was in receipt of a blind pension before she became entitled to the old age non-contributory pension.  The person did not know that she could not draw both pensions and recently she got a bill from the Department for £2,477.  I know the officials will deal quite sympathetically with her, but nonetheless this bill went out to an old blind person.  She did not make the mistake.  She genuinely did not know that one cannot draw both pensions. The Department have the computers and all the back-up services so surely the Department should accept a mistake if they make it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested to hear the Deputy querying the Accounting Officer at the Committee of Public Accounts about money paid out in error and asking him if the Department should not make every reasonable effort to recover the money.  I presume that if the Deputy received money in excess of what he was due he would be anxious to have the matter cleared up as quickly as possible. In percentage terms, over-payments represent 0.4 per cent of the total.  The money would be of the order of £2.8 million which is classified as non-fraudulent over-payment.  That relates to 1989. The Department have a difficulty in this respect.  At other times Deputies will exhort the Department not to wait too long, to pay money out and sort out problems afterwards.  One the other hand, the Department could insist that they would hold back money until they were absolutely certain that everything was in order.  We are dealing with £3,000 million in payments.  Mistakes are few.  In practical terms and in terms of money there is generally not a problem and the officers deal sympathetically with people when mistakes occur.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 8, 19 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>I am happy to be able to inform the House that the report of the Review Group on the Treatment of Households in the social welfare system was laid before the Oireachtas on 23 May.  In keeping with the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the report will be discussed with appropriate interests.  The Government have approved the publication of the report in full and copies of the report have been made available to all groups which made submissions.  It will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>Possible options for the future development of the payments system are identified in the report but the group were unable to decide on the most suitable approach to further changes in the present arrangements.</P>
      <P>A number of specific instances in the social welfare code which treated married couples less favourably than unmarried cohabiting couples were amended in the Social Welfare Act, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These concerned the payment of child dependent increases, entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance and assessment of means for family income supplement.  When the review group were set up I said that the question of the treatment of different household situations within the social welfare code was a very complex area which needed full and careful consideration.  This report shows now true my evaluation was at that time.  The group examined the existing rules in the social welfare code and how these affect households of different kinds &mdash; married couples, cohabiting couples and relatives or non-relatives sharing a household.  The report is a very expert and forthright presentation of highly <Col N="818" /> complex legal and administrative arrangements and I have no doubt that there will be widespread interest in the issues raised.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issues with appropriate interests.  I am confident that the end result will be proposals for a consistent and equitable approach to the future development of the social welfare services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 11, 16 and 36, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>A total of 5,386 applications for the carer's allowance have been received up to week ending 24 May 1991.  The number of persons in receipt of the allowance is 3,184.  Of these, 1,400 have been awarded a payment at the maximum rate and 1,784 at a reduced rate.  A further 632 applications are under investigation and new claims are being received at the rate of 65 per week.  Fewer than 20 people who have means in the range £44 to £46 a week are receiving the minimum payment of £3 a week.</P>
      <P>Current claim trends indicate that about 30 per cent of applicants who have not been awarded a carer's allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment at a higher rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> The scheme will be extended as provided for in section 8 of this year's Social Welfare Act to include carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance and carers of people with pensions from countries with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement. It is expected that a considerable number of carers will be included in the extension. The vast majority of those expected to qualify are carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>The question of further extending the categories covered will be considered in the light of available resources.</P>
    <P>An appropriate breakdown of the number of carers on a health board basis will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>Given that only 1,400 people have qualified for full payment under the scheme, will the Minister agree that it is a sham, as was pointed out in this House on a number of occasions? Will he also agree that it is bad economics to force old people into institutions where it costs £300 as opposed to the payment of £50 to a carer?  Will the Minister further agree that it is bad health care to force people out of their own homes and that home care is best?  What the Minister is doing is a charter for the private, exploitative, so called private nursing homes.

The Minister is loquacious &mdash; although he has many good points &mdash; but he has only managed to answer three priority questions so far.  Everybody thought this scheme had great potential as it was hyped up to the last.  They thought that there would be justice for women &mdash; mná na hÉireann as they are referred to &mdash; for all their good work, but there has only been an increase of 22 <Col N="822" /> people applying for it.  It is almost impossible to accept that the Minister is not bluffing on the carer's allowance because he said at a previous Question Time that there had been an increased take-up.  It is not justice to those who are keeping old people out of hospital; it is time the Minister dealt properly with the problem and stopped showing complete disregard for the women who are doing such great work.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are 65,000 people providing care on a voluntary basis for elderly and sick peole who ought to be cared for in hospitals at great expense to the State and is he happy that only 1,400 are in receipt of the maximum allowance of a miserable £45 per week?  The Minister keeps telling us that £8 million has been made available but may I ask him where would the money have been found if the 8,000 people who had been expected to avail of the scheme had in fact qualified?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies should be clear on the figures.  First, the number of people providing full-time care and attention is not 65,000; it is estimated to be 25,000.  Whether that estimate is accurate is another question but we should stick to that figure.  This is where I think the question of &ldquo;electionitis&rdquo; comes in.

Will the Minister allow those without any income, irrespective of how much their spouses or others in the home earn, avail of the carer's allowance?  It must be remembered that this allowance is means-tested and for each pound earned over £2 per week there is a pound for pound cut.  I put it to the Minister that that is not a carer's allowance at all &mdash; I pointed out the pitfalls when the Bill went through the Dáil &mdash; and would ask him to allow the persons providing care in the home to avail of the allowance if they have no income.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for evaluation of the programme is a matter for the European Commission.  In February 1991 the Commission published its final report on the programme.  The purpose of this report was to evaluate the measures implemented and set out the lessons to be learned.</P>

At least one quarter of the people in this country are living in poverty and only the people in Greece and Portugal are worse off.

      <P>We stressed the value of the projects from our point of view and succeeded in having two major projects in Limerick and Connemara and one smaller project involving the travelling community in Dublin included in the third programme.  We have made the argument for that.  We would have our own ideas on how the money for these projects should be spent but the Community would not necessarily agree with us on that.  We can only put our views forward.  We learn things from them, and, as the Deputy will know, I introduced a community development programme throughout the country last year.  That programme is going well.  The Government agreed to provide the funding for three years.  We have picked out what we believed was particularly valuable in the previous projects and built a development programme on it.  When the partners in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> went about developing an area based strategy quite a large number of the projects fitted into that strategy and provided a basis on which to build.

      <Quest>the reason the income level allowable under the social welfare equality legislation, which allows a husband on social welfare to claim payment in respect of his wife; was not increased this year, his views on whether this figure should be increased in line with inflation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the introduction of the principle of equal treatment in matters of social security under EC Directive 79/7, the definition of dependency in the social welfare code had to be revised.  Under the revised arrangements, a spouse is not regarded as an adult dependant where he or she is either in receipt of a social welfare payment in his or her own right or has weekly earnings from employment or self-employment in excess of a specified limit.  The earnings limit was set at £50 in November 1986.  It was increased to £55 with effect from the beginning of June 1990.</P>
      <P>Any further increase in the limit would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.  The question of the limit also arises for consideration in the context of the payment arrangements generally for households of different types.  This issue will be considered in the light of the report of the working group on the treatment of households under the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite disturbing that the earning limit was set at £50 in 1986 and increased to £55 in 1990 but that <Col N="831" /> there as no increase in the budget this year.  This has effectively deprived dependants, thousands of women in the main, who are earning slightly in excess of £55 per week and were not given the comparable increase in line with the cost of living.  The particular case that has been brought to the attention of the Minister concerns a woman who is earning £56.2p a week, a miserable £1.2p over the £55 limit, and who, therefore, loses out substantially.  Would the Minister promise to carry out a total review of the income limit and upgrade it at least in accordance with the rate of inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The household review group, who are an expert group, as the Deputy will realise, considered that the £55 limit is inconsistent with the need to treat households with similar needs in a consistent and equitable fashion.  The group considered &mdash; and this is in the report that is now available &mdash; that the income limit should be reduced from £55 to the adult dependant allowance rate, which is £31 but that payment should be made on a tapered rate above that limit, in other words that the figure should be set at £31 but that there should be a tapering payment above that.  In the group's view the term &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; should be replaced by an alternative term, such as qualified partner, and the allowance payable in respect of a cohabiting partner.  This has been reviewed as part of an extensive review by the household review group and it is now a matter for discussion.  When the Deputy gets the opportunity to read their report he will realise that is the conclusion they came to</P>

However they get the 4 per cent increase but the phasing out of the alleviation payment affects the amount involved.  Perhaps the proposal of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government to eliminate these payments would have been considered better, but that would have reduced people's payments by about £20 per week and then there would have been the question of rent allowances and so on.</P>

      <P>In reply to a similar question on 31 January 1991, I gave details of my Department's building programme to provide new offices and to improve existing offices in terms of facilities and privacy. I am glad to say that progress continues to be made on this programme.</P>
      <P>Recently the final phase of the Letterkenny decentralisation project was completed with the transfer of the staff dealing with the treatment benefit scheme.  Two other major projects completed in the past two years were the pensions services office in Sligo and the social welfare appeals office in Dublin &mdash; all offices of a very high standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already this year, a new office has been opened in Limerick, bringing to 16 <Col N="834" /> the number completed in recent years. Work on a new office at Ennis is nearing completion and is expected to be ready for fitting-out about the end of July.  In addition, I expect that work on a new office at Finglas, Dublin will commence within the next few weeks.  Planning for offices at Tallaght and Navan Road, Dublin and in Kilkenny is proceeding and I expect building work to start before the end of the year.  New offices will also be provided in conjunction with the Government's proposed decentralisation projects at Wexford and Longford.  In any other area where my Department have an office and where new decentralised premises are being constructed, I will where necessary, be seeking to have a new social welfare services office included in the plans.  I am also considering proposals for other new offices to replace existing accommodation and extend services to new ones.</P>
    <P>The building programme also includes refurbishment of existing offices, where appropriate, and to date ten projects have been completed.  Work on the refurbishment of the office in Cavan is already underway and I expect that work on projects at Athlone, Carlow and Mullingar will start later this year.</P>
    <P>I am determined that the progress already made in improving the standard of my Department's accommodation will be maintained and in this regard, the programme will be advanced as quickly as financial and technical resources will allow.</P>

      <P>The 7,500 people who sign on at an eight-year-old prefab will be delighted that the Minister made reference to the Navan Road but, unfortunately, the work is not to start for some time.  Queueing and the dole have become synonymous.  Will the Minister make a determined effort to structure payments in such a way that people are not forced to queue, often in inclement weather during the winter months?  Is the Minister aware of the need for privacy and that the offices should be provided with booths rather than hatches?  This would give dignity and privacy to those <Col N="835" /> unfortunate enough to be drawing payments. I am delighted that the social partners recognise the degree of dissatisfaction among those drawing dole payments.  Will the Minister also extend his consideration to community welfare officers working for the health boards and dispensing social welfare money in the most Dickensian, dirty, backward, filthy and unhygienic conditions?</P>

      <P>Of course I want the best possible facilities everywhere.  The health boards are the responsibilty of the Minister for Health and the social welfare offices are my responsibility.  We have completed 16 new offices in recent years and work is continuing.  Work at the Navan Road is to start before the end of this year.  It is at an advanced stage of planning, as is the Tallaght office.  All these offices have the most modern facilities to provide privacy for people using them.  I hope that when we have modern offices we will get from Deputies opposite the support which the Department deserve for the work that has been done. There will be changes in the systems.  We are providing a more personalised and faster service and we are advancing very <Col N="836" /> rapidly with computerisation.  This will give us options of various kinds.  I hope when the day comes that we are opening one of these offices the Deputy will come and support us.  Recently Deputy Byrne's party chose to put a picket outside when we were opening a new office with all the facilities for which the Deputy has been calling.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Part II of the Act shall not be brought into operation until the Competition Authority has been established and operating for a period of at least six months during which time the Authority will issue guidelines on this Act and on its own procedures and also has issued the areas to which block exemptions for categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices will apply.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I had pretty much concluded my point which was dealing with Deputy Barry's amendment to postpone the operation of the critical part of the Bill for six months.  I was making the point that the firms, companies and undertakings that would be most strongly affected by it would be well able to meet the requirements of the Bill without the necessity of having the benefit of a six months' extension and that for that reason the Labour Party would not be supporting Deputy Barry's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you can see why I made the point this morning that the amendment in the Minister's name and my amendment were different and needed separate discussion. Deputy Taylor repeated the point he made before the break.  in relation to the firms that Deputy Taylor and the Minister are concerned with, of course it is correct, and if they are <Col N="926" /> engaged in &ldquo;abuse of a dominant position&rdquo; then the quicker that situation is controlled the better.  What I am talking about is the whole lot of other businesses and industries that will be affected by this legislation.  The Minister says that it is only in certain instances, where they are abusing a dominant position for example, that they will be affected.  That is correct, but the point is that nobody knows until the guidelines, or at least the parameters within which the authority intend to work, have been set down whether they are in that position or not.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister says there is a 12 month gap in another part of the order. That is correct, but that is to deal with the firms Deputy Taylor is talking about, and they will know they must lodge such agreements, that they are subject to control by this law, and that they must go to the expense of preparing an accountant's submission to the authority when they are established.  I am talking about the other 98 per cent of firms that will be affected by this legislation.  To give an absolutely ridiculous example, say there were two barbers in the one town who decided they would up the price of a haircut by £1, is that an abuse of a dominant position in that town?  It is so ridiculous it is hardly worth talking about but under the law much less serious things could be involved.  Because of the speed with which this legislation was brought in, because of the lack of consultation beforehand, I think firms are entitled to a six months respite so they can see the guidelines being drawn up by the authority when they are established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that the Fair Trade Commission's report was published on 16 April and the Bill was published on 20 April and that this was adequate time. That is just ridiculous.  The Minister and the Department had the report for 18 months.  If they had at least published it when they got it in early 1990 there might be some basis for the Minister's argument. In Britain when they were introducing legislation dealing with Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, which is what this Competition Bill is based on, there was a Green Paper and a White <Col N="927" /> Paper, and I understand there were over 200 submissions between the two before any legislation was introduced.  No consultations took place here, even though there have been representations, as the Minister says, post-publication of the Second Reading debate.</P>
    <P>However, there are smaller traders who may feel they might be involved and who will feel they must, because of their uncertainty in this regard, go to enormous expense.  The main criticism I have of this Bill is the uncertainty it has created within the business community.  People just do not know where they stand.  They have already had to take on board a lot of expense because of other legislation and now they may have to take on board the expense of preparing a submission to the authority to get an exemption or, as the Minister says, a licence.  A point I will come to later on another amendment is that the Minister uses the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; and &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; interchangeably. Even though the explanatory memorandum uses &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; the Bill uses &ldquo;licence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that it is perfectly fair that these people in that grey area who do not know whether or not they will have to go to the expense of engaging accountants and lawyers to make a submission through the authority to see whether an agreement they have with a supplier will be part of an exemption or not should have some time.  It is just to allow the authority to draw up guidelines which will indicate to people that they need not apply for such an exemption. That is the purpose of my amendment, to have a six month gap between the setting up of the authority and the coming into effect of Part II of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the claim being made by Deputy Barry that businesses are being hit for the very first time without any background knowledge or understanding that changes of this kind were coming. Since the early seventies the trading sector have been dealing with this matter. <Col N="928" /> In the Programme for Government, 1989, it was indicated that the legislation in this area would be introduced.  People are familiar with what is happening in Europe generally in recent times in this area.</P>
      <P>Section 2 does not mean that all provisions need come in simultaneously.  I understand the Minister indicated this morning that he would be looking at how best the provisions could be introduced to take account of the fears individual businesses have.  Clearly, for a great number of businesses the transitional period will suffice.  Deputy Barry will, I think, accept that not to bring into force the provisions enshrined in this legislation to deal with known abuses would be unjustified by the points Deputy Barry is putting forward.  The transitional period and the opportunity for notification generally, a period of up to 12 months for businesses would suffice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `The Director' means the Director of consumer Affairs;&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this, and the connected amendments, is to give a role in the operation of this Bill to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I regard the position of the consumer as being paramount in this legislation.  It should be about protecting the consumer who goes into his <Col N="929" /> or her local supermarket, or whatever. The office with primary responsibility in our system for protecting the consumer is the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, to use the full and correct title.  Consequently, it is rather strange that the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade is excluded from the operations of this Bill.  He is not even mentioned in the Bill as submitted to the House.</P>
    <P>The director is given no role in securing the rights of and protecting the interests of consumers generally.  Why should that be?  The Minister has gone to great lengths to set up a competition authority to monitor the provisions of the Bill at the macro end, big inter-company contracts, arrangements, deals and so on, but there is nobody to look after the interests of those at the bottom end of the scale, the interests of a person who goes into a shop to buy meat, a chicken, an item of grocery, petrol in a garage or whatever. That should not be allowed by the House.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 3, and my other amendments, is to give a specific role, as would seem logical and appropriate, to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade in addition to the other enforcement rights granted to other persons and agencies.  If it is brought to the notice of the director that a consumer's position has been abused and members of the public make a complaint which is upheld by the director, the director, the competition authority and the individual should be entitled to bring the matter before the court so that the rights of the consumer are protected.  After all, that is supposed to be the ultimate aim of this Bill.  Consequently, it is entirely logical and appropriate that the interests of the consumer be represented by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.</P>
    <P>To leave it to a private individual to enforce the important rights being granted to members of the public under the Bill would be putting an impossible burden on that person.  It would be wrong to expect an ordinary member of the public to raise the funds, make the inquiries, secure the evidence and go into court, <Col N="930" /> what is more, the High Court as the Minister has provided for in the Bill.  Account should be taken of the enormous legal costs involved and the economic expert witnesses required to prove and prove to a court, for example, that one company had established a dominant position in a particular trade in the State.  That would require tremendous resources, effort and hard cash.  Let us face it, no individual or even small company would be prepared to do that.  It requires a State resource. One such resource for that purpose should be the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade who is charged specifically with ensuring fair trading and a fair deal for the consumer.  That is the purpose of this group of amendments and I ask the House to support them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has said, this amendment introduces the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade into the Bill with a view to his enforcement role which is suggested in amendments Nos. 44, 81 and 82.  This raises the whole enforcement issue which is central to the Bill.</P>
      <P>One of the core features of this Bill is its enforcement mechanism.  Previous competition legislation, in so far as we had it and that would be the Restrictive Practices Acts, laid the emphasis on the State as the primary enforcement agency. Provision was also made for the private enforcement of the legislation but that private enforcement was very rarely used.  To ascertain where the balance of enforcement should lie in the legislation before us we have to ask one very fundamental question.  In the first instance, who stands to gain from the enforcement of this legislation?  The answer is a business which has been put at a disadvantage by practices that breach competition rules.  Such a business will be the gainer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> The next question we must ask is, if business is the primary beneficiary of this new legislation then should they not also have the primary role in the enforcement of the rules?  Why should the taxpayer fund redress for civil wrongs in the commercial sector?  For example, in the case of trade mark infringement the remedy is the same as that proposed in section 6, namely, civil action by the party affected. Section 6 (4) gives the Minister the power to take an action.  This is a reserved power where the Minister can take an action in the public interest and it can be used in a conspicuous way should the need arise.</P>
    <P>That the area of law is new does not mean it will be any different to enforce. The Bill gives people the power to exercise their economic rights.  Nobody should have the power by virtue of his size or by virtue of the anti-competitive practices in which he engages to deprive anyone else of the economic right to enter or to compete on an equal basis in any market.  It is a basic economic right that anyone adversely affected by the anti-competitive activities of others should have the power to seek redress in the courts.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, who is better to judge and testify that a wrong has been done than the person who has been wronged? Amendment No. 44 would give the director the specific role to act &ldquo;when he is of the opinion that such agreement... adversely affects the interests of the consumer&rdquo;. Ultimately, all anti-competitive agreements affect the consumer adversely.  They usually affect business first.  Giving an enforcement role to the director would rapidly become a crutch on which business, in particular big business, would hang their cases.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 81 and 82 would enable the director to have authorised officers and to provide them with powers, but I suggest that if there is no role for the director it is unnecessary to give him officials of that kind.  It has not been proven that it is necessary to have another State enforcement agency or that we should greatly expand our existing one in a matter like this.  The best analogy that <Col N="932" /> can be brought in is not the one Deputy Taylor used; it is rather the analogy with the protection of trade marks.</P>
    <P>It would be unthinkable that some State agency would intervene to protect the private property of some person or company in a trade mark.  It would be taken for granted that they should protect themselves through civil action.  That is the way this should be approached.  If they are wronged by concerted practice, an anti-competitive practice or the abuse of a dominant position, they should assert that right.  I can envisage circumstances in which it might be more appropriate for a Minister to do it.  As I have said, section 6 (4) enables that to be done but I see that in only a minority of cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <P>I must say I find the Minister's reaction to Deputy Taylor's case, with which I do not fully agree, depressing. It augurs very badly for amendments to be made to this Bill at a later stage if the authority are to be allowed to initiate an action in regard to an unfair practice or an abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is almost naive to suggest that a small supplier who feels an unfair action has been taken against him by a major store would take that store to court to have this wrong redressed.  It is an extraordinary suggestion.  The criticisms made outside this House about this Bill being a lawyers' paradise are correct.  Lawyers will be able to charge huge fees in this regard.  To suggest that a supplier would take a major company to court because they were abusing their dominant position is ludicrous. Small suppliers would not have the resources at their disposal to do this.  As Deputy Taylor rightly said, the cost of going to the High Court would be enormous. Even if a supplier won his case he would be without this customer in the future.  Suppliers have to make a choice between being damaged or put out of business, a Hobson's choice so far as a small supplier to a big firm is concerned. It is not realistic to suggest that a small supplier could initiate a court case to protect his position.  The authority should be given the right under the Bill to initiate <Col N="933" /> a case if a complaint is made to them about a major purchaser.</P>
    <P>As the Minister correctly said, all legislation of this nature should ultimately protect the interests of the consumer.  It is ridiculous to suggest that an individual supplier who would not have the resources behind him could take a big firm to court.  He would want to have major resources behind him if he wanted to take a case to the High Court.  The Bill deals with businesses and it is much more appropriate that the competition authority should initiate such proceedings.  I have a later amendment to this effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response to Deputy Taylor's amendment does not give me any great cause for hope in this area. This legislation is very important to the business community who already have to bear huge costs as a result of Government legislation which imposed costs on them. I find it deeply depressing that they are now being asked to put themselves out of business by taking one of their major customers to court if he abuses a dominant position.  It is depressing to think that the State will not protect the small man in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry puts the major emphasis on the business community and how they will be affected under the terms of the Bill.  This is very important and I do not decry it. However, I put my major emphasis on the rights and position of individual consumers who are as involved in this issue as much as big or small businesses.  These people are not being provided for here at all.  This is a very grave hiatus.  Quite frankly the Minister's approach to what he would regard as a breach of this Bill has left us in a very confused position. In the course of the Minister's reply on Second Stage it came across, from reading between the lines, that he had thought long and hard about whether the remedy should be civil or criminal or a cross between the two.  Sometimes if one dwells too long on such matters one ends up with a kind of mish-mash which is very unsatisfactory.  This is what has happened here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> Section 4 (1) lists the practices which are prohibited under the Bill.  When an Act of the Oireachtas prohibits something, we are not talking about a civil wrong, a breach of contract, etc.  A breach of contract may be unlawful but it is not prohibited.  When something is prohibited in a Bill it means that there is a criminal element involved in it and not a civil element.  The word &ldquo;prohibit&rdquo; is more referable to a criminal element than to a civil element.  Otherwise what we are saying is that this Bill prohibits a certain thing being done but if that prohibition imposed by law is breached it will be left willy-nilly to some private individual to take the case to court to do something about it.  In other words, we in this House do not mind if something we prohibit is breached and the only distance we are prepared to go in this regard is to say that a person may, if he has courage enough to do it, go to court and initiate proceedings to remedy the problem and if he does not do this it is all right by us and we, as the State, do not mind.  That is unacceptable to me and could not possibly be right.</P>
    <P>The Minister's analogy to a trade mark position is not a good one as a trade mark is a different position altogether &mdash; it constitutes a clear, specific, definite and vested right of property in a particular thing.  When a person's right of property is abused, it is acceptable, normal and perfectly reasonable that that person should take civil proceedings in whatever way is appropriate.  We are not talking here about any clear definitive vested property rights such as those granted by a patent or trade mark.  It is a different kind of situation altogether.</P>
    <P>If the State takes the view that the kind of anti-competitive practices, abuse of positions, etc., we speak of in this Bill are wrong and unacceptable and should be prohibited, it is no good saying we will leave that to a private individual to enforce.  The State must have a role in it. We are dealing here with more than just big business.  The Bill addresses three categories, big business, small business and individual consumers and seeks to <Col N="935" /> improve their position.  So far as big business is concerned, I hold no brief for them as they have no problem and can go to the High Court or Supreme Court because they have the resources to do this.  So far as small business is concerned, they would not be geared to undertake this kind of complex High Court action, the only remedy given to them under the Bill.  Even a medium-sized company would have to think very carefully and strongly about this.</P>
    <P>Virtually every line in the Bill is open to abstruse legal argument.  To set about establishing whether a particular firm are exercising a dominant position in a trade comes easily off the tongue in a few words but it would take a fairly skilled team of economists to satisfy a court beyond reasonable doubt that a firm trading in a particular way, first, were in a dominant position and, secondly, were abusing it. One would need to carry out a very detailed examination of their trading levels over a period and their proportion of the market.  One would also need expert advice from economists on what percentage of a trade in a country in a particular item of goods would constitute a dominant position.  Even if they were in a dominant position you would have to satisfy the court that that dominant position was being abused.  The cost to economists who would have to undertake tremendous research to furnish such a report and give the evidence would be enormous.  It would be met by countermanding evidence from other economists from the person or company against whom the claim was being brought, the case could run for a fortnight in the High Court, and possibly longer by the time the legal boys had made their arguments and so on, and could end up on appeal to the Supreme Court.  What small or medium sized business will undertake that?  It is not realistic.</P>
    <P>To put the position even stronger, what individual consumer, even in his wildest dreams, would undertake a High Court action because he was charged too much, because he was the victim of an abused position or because a certain concerted <Col N="936" /> practice operated pricewise against him? That is not on, that is not for real.  Either we are setting out to help the consumer and small businesses or we are not.  If we want to help the consumer, the man in the street who buys petrol, meat, food and so on, then let us do it realistically. Let us examine here on Committee Stage how he can be helped.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the main benefit would go to the small business.  That may be, but getting a benefit at the end of a High Court action and possibly going on appeal is very far down the road.  When a person or a small company is at a disadvantage, the State has a role to help him.  There is no merit in bringing in a Bill which purports to give a benefit to the consumer when, at the same time that consumer is not given the means to enforce his right.  You might as well not give it to him unless you give him also the means to do something about it.</P>
    <P>If we had a legal aid scheme &mdash; or something of that nature &mdash; which measured up to the needs of the situation, that would be a help.  If the Minister introduced his Bill and said he would upgrade the legal aid service available for people who cannot afford it, that would have been of assistance but we see nothing on those lines.  It is not a matter of providing a crutch for business; if we are going to do something new, it is very important that we do it properly.</P>
    <P>There is already an agency under the aegis of the Department whose role is the protection of the interests of consumers &mdash; the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  This is not an office I wish to involve in this issue, this is on the very subject we are talking about &mdash; consumerism and fair trading.  I would have thought it almost axiomatic when that office exists &mdash; which was set up for the purpose of looking after and protecting the interests of the consumer and of fair trading &mdash; that they would have been involved in what is taking place here.  All I seek to do is give the director a role.  I do not say that an obligation should be put on the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to bring a prosecution in every case referred to him.  The Minister <Col N="937" /> made the point that that would be a crutch.  However, I do not say that but where the director and his officials collate the information and evidence they need to bring a prosecution it should at least be open to the director to do that.  That is a very reasonable request.</P>
    <P>It is equally reasonable that appropriate inquiring and investigating officials should be made available to enable the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to fulfil his function.  If that is not done the office of the director will be automatically downgraded because what should come within his field of operations would be specifically excluded under the provisions of this Bill.  The title of Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade will be a misnomer.  He will no longer be in control of the brief given to him because he will not have a role protecting the consumer or overseeing fair trading so far as any of the matters coming within the ambit of this Bill are concerned.  I am at a loss to understand the Minister's response &mdash; as is Deputy Barry.  The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has his officials but he would need more to enable him to deal with the new positions being set up under this Bill.</P>
    <P>If we are realistic in purporting to advance the interests of consumers and consumerism in Ireland, then we should agree to this amendment.  The Minister should give the director the necessary staff to oversee the interests of at least the consumer.  We will deal with small and medium sized companies in different ways in later amendments.  As I said, the large businesses are well able to look after themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Enforcement is one of the main issues in this Bill.  The Minister seems to be equating the interests of small business and the interests of the consumer; they need not be the same at all times.  The Minister asks who is impacted on adversely first, and he says it is small business.  For the reasons Deputy Barry has explained, it may well be that small business will be impacted on adversely first, but they may not have the capacity to do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> If I am supplying one of the multiples with vegetables from north Dublin and my margins are being squeezed beyond commercial viability, there is probably not a great deal I can do about it.  If I do manage somehow to do something about it &mdash; as Deputy Barry said &mdash; and I am successful, then I no longer have a market for my vegetables.  One of the reasons we have such extensive imports of potatoes and other vegetables is the clout of the multiples.  How is the interest of the consumer protected?  The consumer may be sick that he is paying 9p per pint for liquid milk which in his view ought to constitute a grievance.</P>
    <P>Section 6 refers to any person who is aggrieved in consequence of any of a combination of practices which are prohibited. I understood from that that any person who is aggrieved has a right of action.  That point was taken up in the CII submission where they came out against the words &ldquo;any person who is aggrieved&rdquo; and argued for the words &ldquo;any injured party&rdquo;.  I thought the point of the Minister standing by &ldquo;aggrieved&rdquo; was that it envisaged a situation where a consumer, or any group of consumers, may be aggrieved persons but they may not be &ldquo;injured parties&rdquo; in the sense of being a party to this affair whose business is adversely affected and who have been injured in the legal sense of the term as a result of whatever the anti-competitive practice or collusion taking place.</P>
    <P>The Minister was seeking to protect not only the right to litigate of an injured party but also the right of any person who feels he has a grievance.  I do not agree with the CII argument on this.  It is important that the wording, &ldquo;any aggrieved person&rdquo; remain in the Bill.  One could envisage a position whereby, for example, consumers could combine to exercise their right to litigate to vindicate a particular right they have, but the question is whether they have the financial capacity to do so under this Bill.  It appears clear from the cheering one hears about in the Bar library that the individual consumer, or indeed any combination of consumers, is not likely to have that financial capacity.  I tried in a <Col N="939" /> different fashion in amendment No. 42 to provide for the same idea.  I sought to give the authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Chair has noticed that recently there is a tendency on Committee Stage to assume that particular amendments represent the only opportunity of dealing with other matters.  I know the amendments we are discussing here affect sections other than section 3, but we should deal with the subject matter of the amendment particularly as it relates to what is before us rather than ranging over other sections. All these sections will be put and people can discuss them when we reach them. The Chair would like Deputies to confine themselves more specifically to the amendments before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first and only time I propose to address this amendment and I promise to be brief.  This matter is very important.  What the Minister is setting out to do is to create a competitive environment as a result of which the consumer will gain.  The Minister's argument is that the consumer benefits from the least impediments in the way of a competitive economy.  The questions at issue in this amendment are: how precisely does the consumer benefit, how are his rights protected and how may he enforce a perceived grievance.  It is important that the argument is made that, for the reasons we have set out, it is completely unrealistic to expect that a consumer or a combination of consumers may be able to avail of the right to litigate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to my amendment No. 42 in which I propose to give the Authority the right to take action where the Authority are satisfied that any person has reasonable grounds for action in consequence of any agreement, decision, concerted practice or abuse under sections 4 or 5 but lacks the financial capacity to initiate such action. Deputy Taylor has taken the approach of the existing Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The director may take <Col N="940" /> upon himself, on behalf of aggrieved consumers, to initiate such an action, and that is important.  Otherwise it is not transparent how the consumer will have a better deal in the post-Competition Bill environment.  It is not right for the Minister to suggest that it is somehow unthinkable that the taxpayer should carry the can for a civil wrong.  Since we have all agreed on the necessity and desirability of optimum competition in the economy why, where a consumer has not the financial capacity to do so, should the taxpayer not intervene to ensure that that right is vindicated and consequently that competition operates more effectively?</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Taylor in that I cannot see that the analogy with the trade mark is a fair one.  It seems the Minister has set out in this Bill to create the optimum competitiveness as between existing companies but it is not clear whether we are legislating for a generally more competitive environment that will facilitate, for example, the entrance of new competitors into the marketplace. However, I will deal with that matter later.  I support Deputy Taylor's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a great deal to add to what I have said already. I will very briefly deal with the points that have been made.  Deputy Barry suggested that the State would have no role in this matter and would not take action in any case, but that is not so.  It is true that the emphasis is on private action. That is the way the Bill is set out and for good reason.  There is of course provision, as I have pointed out already, for the Minister to take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is more directly representative of the State than anyone else.  It is not appropriate for the Authority to be involved.  The Authority act at times in a quasi-judicial fashion in regard to these matters and it is not appropriate that they be the enforcing <Col N="941" /> authority also.  If there has to be non-private enforcement it should be carried out by the Minister, and that is what the Bill provides.  I have to repeat that if the State puts itself up front in enforcement there would be little chance of anyone except the State doing the enforcing. That would be a great pity and would run counter to the way the system operates elsewhere.</P>
      <P>We have heard descriptions of small individual traders being pitted against the might of certain large retailers or other people, but that will not always be the case in practice.  There is nothing to prevent an association of firms taking action on behalf of a firm, a group of firms or consumers generally.  As we all know, there are such organisations, including those who make representations about these matters, who are perfectly in a position to do that without great risk to their individual members.</P>
      <P>The manner in which an action might be taken has been described as being almost universally an action between a supplier and one of his customers, but that is only one type of action that is likely to be common.  There are four actions in all: the others being actions between suppliers as competitors of each other, between the customers of suppliers and the final consumers and between the competing customers of suppliers, all of whom are likely to want to battle against one another in respect of certain practices they do not approve of.  None of those people is in a particularly weak position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the examples that are drawn in this issue as in others seem to relate to the grocery trade which consumers the greatest amount of interest.  I would point out to the House that the Director of Consumer Affairs regularly, year after year, complains about his lack of staff and his inability to police a large number of areas in respect of which he is given responsibility under the different Acts. He will of course retain his powers under the groceries order for as long as that is there, and it may well be there for some time.  I cannot foretell that, because it depends on the way matters develop and, in particular, on the report of the <Col N="942" /> Fair Trade Commission.  While that is there, the director retains his powers in respect of that particular legislation.  I am sure he will be happy not to be burdened with additional powers, since he makes it abundantly clear year after year that he does not have the resources to carry out the functions that have already been given him under statute.</P>
    <P>There is nothing abnormal or unusual in what is suggested in the Bill.  Because it is somewhat new in this country people are perhaps frightened into believing that it will be extremely difficult.  Deputy Taylor quoted some extracts as if they were new concepts in law and in commercial practice.  For example, in section 4 he referred to &ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; and &ldquo;void&rdquo;.  He put great stress on the word &ldquo;prohibited&rdquo;.  However, those two words are taken from Article 85.  They have been the law of the Community for the past 34 years and all larger Irish firms have had to live with them.  Deputy Taylor also laid great emphasis on the phrase &ldquo;dominant position&rdquo;, but that is included in Article 86 and has been there for 34 years.  Again, that is not new.  With respect, I do not think that large bevies of economists are needed to prove what that phrase means; it is well known and long established.  Simply because it has not been used in Irish law before&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the Minister's own experience in a famous case. It can be quite difficult to prove at times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have been less difficult to prove had this law existed at the time of that case, because this law is very clear and the law we had then, and still have is much less clear.  In this proposal, which closely follows Community law, judicial notice is taken of many judicial decisions that have been made through the years on the meaning of such phrases and the way they apply to different trades and different businesses. Under this Bill it will be much easier to prove such cases than under present legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand how <Col N="943" /> it could be easier to prove such matters under this Bill.  Certainly the Bill sets up the position, but I cannot see that it in any way eases the burden of proof that would be on any person or company bringing an action under any of the rights purported to be granted under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister misunderstood what I was saying.  I have no difficulty with the word &ldquo;prohibited&rdquo;.  It is the right word to use.  What I am saying is that what that word implies is not being followed through by what the Minister is doing in his Bill.  When something is prohibited it should not then be left willynilly to a private individual or a company to enforce it.  The word &ldquo;prohibited&rdquo; implies a criminal element in which the State must have the responsibility, which the Minister specifically excluded in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to go over the same ground again, but I want to hone in on one category of case I had in mind in introducing this amendment.  I know there are various categories involved &mdash; actions between retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers and so on, and the Minister listed some of them &mdash; but I want to home in on one particular category of case where no injury is done to the manufacturer, the wholesaler or the retailer but where the consumers in general are adversely affected as a result of activities carried on somewhere along the line, for say, in the distribution of petrol.  For argument's sake, let us say there is an unwarranted, unlawful and prohibited increase of 5p per gallon in petrol as a result of a breach of the provisions of the Act, and the only people adversely affected are consumers.  If the Bill were left in its present form, that would be a classic case in which the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, if given the enforcement role I seek for him, could do something on behalf of consumers generally, who are the only people affected.  No individual consumer would do anything about that.  No individual consumer would enter the arena of the High Court for the sake of a 5p a gallon increase on petrol.  Whether any <Col N="944" /> group of consumers would do that, whether they would have the right to do it under the Bill, I shall speak about later. I am not sure whether a group of consumers have the right to bring an action under the Bill as it stands at the moment. Even if they did, there might be great reluctance on their part to undertake it.</P>
    <P>That should not be the position.  There does not need to be a case in the High Court, with injunctions, declarations and all the rest of it.  All that should be required to protect consumers in such a case is a short, sharp, snappy prosecution in the District Court with appropriate powers being granted the District Court to impose an appropriate fine or to make other appropriate orders to prohibit or deal with the matter.  That would be the simple, cheap way to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry's amendment refers to large fines and other provisions.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that provision is already made in Articles 85 and 86, it is, the Minister is quite right, but he should consider what happens in other countries.  What fines may be imposed in other countries?  There not only is one considering injunctions but there is also provision for fines of millions of pounds.  Even Deputy Barry's amendment for a fine of £1 million is small in comparison to what is appropriate for breaches of Articles 85 and 86 in other countries.  Why run the consumer into complex High Court actions when anything needs to be done?</P>
    <P>I should be interested to hear the Minister say otherwise, but I do not believe for a moment that the Minister and his staff will undertake High Court proceedings to deal with such a case.  I should say &mdash; and I suspect that the Minister in his heart of hearts would agree &mdash; that it would be very rare for the Minister to avail of the back-up reserve position he takes for himself in the Bill to bring about a High Court action to undertake injunction proceedings.  I believe it highly unlikely that that would ever happen.</P>
    <P>The end result of the scenario I describe is that nothing would happen. Abuse would continue, because the only person adversely affected would be the <Col N="945" /> consumer and the consumer would not undertake a High Court case.  As far as the consumer is concerned, that aspect of the Bill would become a laughing stock.  Rights would have been granted that are not realistic nor, in practice, capable of being enforced.  The right will be there but the remedy will not, and nothing will happen.  The abuse will continue and it will reflect no credit on this Legislature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go over this matter in detail again because it will be dealt with in later amendments and sections.  The Minister spoke of European law and Articles 85 and 86.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> What happens there in relation to who can complain is that when a complaint is submitted by a party with a legitimate interest in the matter, the Commission will examine whether the violation of the competition rule has taken place and if the complaint turns out to be well founded, the Commission can then take the necessary measures to put an end to the infringement.  It is not the persons who are affected but the Commission who does it.  That is what we are asking here &mdash; that the Authority do it, that they take the matter up, not the individuals affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), after line 37, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `service' includes all manner and type of service including such services as professional services, rights of access to land and buildings and public services save where the latter practices and activities have been given statutory recognition in existing legislation;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to include &ldquo;service&rdquo; in the definition section.  I am amending the definition of &ldquo;service&rdquo; in section 10 of the Restrictive Practices(Amendment) Act, 1987, which defines &ldquo;services&rdquo; as all professional services but it does not include any service provided by the local authority within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act, 1941.  My definition includes the local authority and makes them subject to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to include all manner and type of service, including professional services, which is the purpose of Deputy Rabbitte's amendment as well, because there could be agreements between professional people and professions which <Col N="950" /> would be &ldquo;an abuse of the dominant position&rdquo;, to go back to the words used originally by the Minister.  The reason I included &ldquo;rights of access to land and buildings&rdquo; is that on at least one occasion &mdash; and there may have been others &mdash; in the development of shopping centres there was a condition attached to one tenant that no other trader of a similar nature would be allowed into the shopping centre.  That could be termed as uncompetitive or anti-competition and perhaps the Minister should look at it.</P>
    <P>I can understand the desire of developers to have a mix of trades in a shopping centre, it is made more attractive as a result, but the Bill should prohibit a trader from making it a condition that no other trader should be allowed to open and compete with him.  I also believe that all Government agencies, including the local authorities, should be subject to the terms of the Bill.  For example, should a Government decide to privatise the refuse collection service, the same conditions should apply to both private operators and the local authorities when the contract is put to tender.</P>
    <P>One of the public services to which I am referring in the latter part of the amendment, which reads &ldquo;public services save where the latter practices and activities have been given statutory recognition in existing legislation&rdquo; is the ESB who have been given a statutory right to generate electricity.  They are, however, engaged in other trading activities and they should be covered by this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is evident that what I am trying to do is widen the definition put forward by the Minister in the Competition Bill to include professional services, the local authorities and rights of access to land and buildings having regard to what I said in relation to the development of shopping centres.  This amendment should be of benefit to the consumer and should ensure fair trading throughout the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Barry's amendment.  There are services operating in a way which is anti-consumer and anti-competition.  I want to draw the <Col N="951" /> attention of the House to the undertaking profession in the city of Dublin where it seems clear there is no competition.  One would not bat an eyelid if one was asked for £2,000 to cover the cost of a funeral in Dublin city whereas the cost of a funeral in Swords on the outskirts of the city would be somewhere between £600 and £800.  At a time of bereavement &mdash; we will all go through this &mdash; people want to do their best for their loved ones. When they are at their most vulnerable someone comes along with a suitable funeral face and beside manner and sells them a service at enormous cost.  If the Competition Bill was extended to include services it would be possible to bring to heel those who take people when they are at their most vulnerable for a very expensive ride.  There would be an outcry if a person hired a taxi and charged the rates being leived at present to carry mourners from Crumlin to Mount Jerome.  Yet daily, mourners are presented with very large bills.  This also happens where children under the age of 12 die &mdash; they cannot be covered by normal insurance, with the result that communities have to raise funds to help the families.  All this happens because there is no competition in the undertaking profession.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that I find the undertaking profession very arrogant.  They do not want to disclose their income or discuss any matters with the public or their representatives.  They want to arrogate to themselves the right to decide what they should charge, and they have failed to answer any question put to them. Their arrogance prompts me to say that if one was to be buried at sea one could hardly be surrounded by more sharks than those operating in the undertaking profession in Dublin city.  It is time the Minister and this House tackled that profession.  I fail to understand why they are not.  I argue very strongly that Deputy Barry's amendment should be accepted to allow him to deal with this profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister prides himself on the fact that he is prepared to take on vested interests.  I would ask him to address this <Col N="952" /> question.  When I raised this matter on the Adjournment recently, the Minister of State read a reply which seemed to have been prepared by the funeral undertakers, some of whom were present in the public gallery and sneering at the Members of this House.  It is time we took them on and extended the Competition Bill to include services to make sure the public are not dealt with in this way when they are at their most vulnerabe.</P>
    <P>The Minister may feel he has to defend himself, his Department or the undertakers, but these people are making substantial profits.  If I recall correctly there are 7,000 funerals each year in Dublin. These generate a fairly substantial turn-over for a small number of people for relatively short journeys, unlike the position outside Dublin city.  It seems there is no competition and people are suffering as a result.  The House should address this matter and one way of doing that would be to insert Deputy Barry's amendment in the Bill, which I strongly support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am seeking to do with my amendment, which is not as wide as Deputy Barry's, is to include professional services in the definition of &ldquo;service&rdquo;. I may be wrong, but I think some of the public activities referred to in Deputy Barry's amendment are covered by the Bill.  It is the view of the man or woman in the street that an organisation or profession can defend the introduction of scaled fees before the law as it currently stands.  On the other hand, a person who is aggrieved or adversely affected by the scaled fee system is not permitted to have his grievance decided on.  It is the view of the man in the street that it is not only in the last journey to which Deputy Mitchell referred that a person finds his estate fleeced, but while he is still alive he can still be fleeced by the professionals and their charge sometimes bears scant regard to the amount of work done.  It is important where there is a suspicion in the public mind of collusion and price fixing in the professions that the matter should come within the scope <Col N="953" /> of the Bill.  That effectively is what the amendment seeks to do.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry's amendment is wider than mine but it does include professional services.  It also refers to rights of access to land.  I would like to hear the Minister's response on that interesting point. However, I am not entirely sure that, in the latter part of his amendment, we are comparing like with like.  If what we are trying to achieve is a levelling of the playing pitch, we have to have regard to the social obligations that are imposed on certain State companies.  If my memory serves me right the Post and Telegraphs Act, 1984, imposes a statutory obligation to provide the service at the same price across the land.  In many cases the only way such a State company can discharge that social obligation is by being permitted cross-subsidisation.  Anyone can provide a courier service in the heart of Dublin but I do not see anybody rushing to provide a courier service from Ardnari to Belmullet and some regard will have to be had to that aspect.  However, I will come back to that point later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Barry's amendment.  An area of concern to me is the monopoly that the ESB are gaining in relation to the sale of white and brown goods.  For some time I have been of the impression that the ESB are using the profit generated from the sale of electricity to subvent the prices at which they can sell these goods.  There is great concern in the trade, and people selling washing machines, cookers, fridges, catering equipment and all other white and brown goods are adamant they cannot compete with the prices at which the ESB are selling these goods.  They have reason to believe that the ESB are transferring the profit from the sale of electricity to ensure they can take advantage of their competitors in this area.  This problem could be tackled by accepting the amendment as put down by Deputy Barry.  Many people in the private sector are finding it difficult at present to ensure that their businesses continue to be viable because of the competition they face from the ESB.  Thousands of traders <Col N="954" /> throughout the country are finding it difficult to make their businesses commercially viable and as a result employment has been hindered.  Very few people engaged in this trade are in a position to say at this time that they will continue to be in business this time next year because of the monopoly the ESB have in this area.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The implications of amendment No. 4 appear to be that public services would be totally excluded from the terms of the Bill, certainly in so far as there is a reference to them in existing legislation.  This is not the intention of the Bill and for that reason I could not accept it.  One of the principles which underlines the approach to this Bill is that the same rules would apply to all sectors of the economy, whether they be in the public or private sector and whether they relate to the provision of services or to manufacturing.  There is no objective reason for excluding services provided by commercial semi-State organisations from the same discipline which the Bill will impose on the private sector.  It would create an imbalance as between the public and private sectors and it would be to the detriment of the semi-State sector because they would be deprived of the stimulus of competition which the Bill will impose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as amendment No. 5 is concerned, professional services are included in the definition.  The danger of mentioning a whole range of specifics, as envisaged in these two amendments, is that a court would then conclude that matters which were not mentioned were not intended to be included.  The intention of the definition of &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; is to be as all embracing of the services as possible.  All services are therefore included, including professional, public, private and whatever else.  The only ones excluded, as the House will see, are those which are provided otherwise than for gain because presumably that would have to be the case &mdash; charities and some other things of that kind where the competitive <Col N="955" /> situation would not arise.  I think it is better that all services be included.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry made the point in regard to access of tenants to premises or land. I was not altogether clear as to what he had in mind but he referred here to rights of access to lands and buildings which is, of course, a matter for landlord and tenant law and land law and is not a matter for this Bill.  I would have thought that if somebody had been excluded and refused access to a premises that was a matter for him to vindicate under the appropriate landlord and tenant law.</P>
    <P>In so far as undertakers are concerned, I am glad to inform Deputy Mitchell that undertakers are covered by the definition of &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo;.  They would of course be excluded if I were to accept these amendments because services which were not specifically referred to here would, by implication, be excluded.  As it is, it is clear that undertaking is a service provided for gain and therefore it comes under the definition of an &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo;. If the situation in regard to the trade of undertaking in Dublin is as described by Deputy Mitchell and there is a cartel between those who engage in the trade of undertaking, it can be challenged under this Bill when it will be enacted and it would be quite appropriate for somebody to do so if that is the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry referred to the sale of white and brown goods by the ESB.  This was investigated by the Director of Consumer Affairs, at my request, about 18 months ago, and he, to my surprise, came to the conclusion that there was no restrictive practice on the part of the ESB.  However the Bill will give people the right to take action in court if they feel otherwise.  The ESB are, of course, included under the provisions of the Bill &mdash; all aspects of their services are included.  For that reason it is much better to have the widest possible definition, excluding nothing rather than listing things that are included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct then to say that everything is included because it has not been listed as being excluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wished to get in a definition of services because I was not sure that professional services or the local authority services were included, but as the Minister has said they are included, I accept his undertaking in that regard.</P>
      <P>The point I was trying to raise in regard to access to land was that it came to my notice when a shopping centre was being developed that one tenant insisted on a clause being inserted that no other trader involved in the same trade would be leased a premises in that shopping centre. I am trying to ensure that such a practice, which is a restrictive practice, would not be continued.  I can understand that a developer of a shopping centre would want to get a mix of trades and that is perfectly right because it makes the place attractive and will draw more customers but I do not think any one trader should be allowed to have a clause in his lease that precludes somebody in the same trade from coming in and having a shop in the centre as well.</P>

      <P>If local authorities provide services otherwise than for gain, obviously they are not included.  Charities would be the other example.  If local authorities are providing a service for payment, then they are covered.  In Dublin city and county the local authorities are not paid for performing certain services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in that they are all part of the same thing and it is not easy to deal with one.  That is why the Chair originally suggested that all four amendments be taken together. They are related.  In the instance that Deputy Barry gives of a restrictive covenant in a lease, I would not like to answer that question here.  I cannot get advice on the matter.  It probably is covered by this Bill and I would like to check it out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My feeling on that latter point is that it probably is not covered.  I agree with the Minister that it would not be appropriate to this Bill since it is purely a landlord and tenant matter.  There are provisions dealing with restrictive clauses in leases as to the user of particular shops and so on.  The courts have generally taken the view that it is a reasonable thing to do in certain circumstances to make shopping centres viable and to keep them broadly based.  It is more appropriate to landlord and tenant law than to a competition Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point about the undertaking being for gain brings a couple of queries to mind.  The building societies would maintain that they are not in business for gain, that they are mutual societies and that profits are ploughed back into the business. They do not declare dividends and do not seek to make profits.  If building societies got together to operate a cartel, could they argue for exclusion from the operation of the Bill on the basis that they do not operate for gain?  They charge for their services and they charge interest, but that is at a different level. Gain, they would argue, is not the object of the exercise, whereas a company is in <Col N="958" /> the business of making profits and distributing them to shareholders.</P>
    <P>Local authorities occupy a dominant position in regard to some of the services they give.  Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council are in the business of issuing letters to solicitors to certify that a particular road is in charge of the local authority and they charge the princely sum of £30 for each such letter, which is paid for by the consumer. Anyone involved in buying a house has to have the search done.  Nobody else can give such a letter.  The local authorities have 100 per cent of the market in issuing those letters.  Could it be argued that too much is being charged and that the dominant position is being abused?</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), after line 37, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `service' includes such services as professional service;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The current position is that professional bodies can arrange to fix fees to exclude price competition on the basis that, in their view, such price fixing arrangements are in the public interest or could be required by a professional code or practice. The Minister says professional services are included in the general definition.

      <P>The kind of people to whom the Deputy refers did engage in price fixing by laying down scales of fees. <Col N="959" /> I do not recall their being challenged because I presume they were not in breach of the law.  If this Bill is passed, then because professional services are included, these practices will become illegal.  The proof is that the bodies concerned have already started to change their arrangements in this regard.  It would, of course, be open to them to apply for an exemption if they could justify it.  They would have to apply to the competition authority and the onus would be on them to justify what would otherwise be an anti-competitive practice. I doubt very much if they would be able to do that but they could apply anyway.  Whether they would be able to convince the authorities is open to some doubt.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 2, to delete &ldquo;for gain&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 85 of the rules of competition lists various things which shall be prohibited as incompatible with the Common Market, and there is no mention of the words &ldquo;for gain&rdquo;.  I cannot see the purpose of the Minister's definition of an undertaking as being engaged for gain in the production of and the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services.  From the Minister's definition it appears that the object of the undertaking must be to make a profit or a gain whereas under the Treaty of Rome it appears that the very activity itself is also in question.  There appears to me to be two different things here.  I do not see why the Minister should say that undertakings for gain are the only ones that should be affected when it appears from <Col N="960" /> the European Community that undertakings, whether for gain or not, are subject to Article 85 of the rules of competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister is thinking about this, let me make another point. I withdrew amendment No. 4 on the understanding that local authorities were included.  I find now they are not and I am in a bit of a quandary as to what to do about it because I think local authorities should be subject to this legislation.  I can envisage situations where they could be competing to provide services &mdash; refuse collection, for example &mdash; and they should not be in any better position to provide those services at the cheapest possible cost than a private company.  I understand from the Minister now that they are not included.  Given that he has admitted he made a mistake in that regard, I hope we will have an opportunity to correct that and that he will include local authorities.  They should be subject to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the object of including the words &ldquo;for gain&rdquo; was simply to exclude local authorities I would have thought it would have been better draftsmanship to have left that out and to have specifically excluded them.  I do not say they should be excluded, but if that was the intention, specifically excluding them would have been a more clearcut way of doing it.  As it is I do not know whether it does exclude them.  Take the example I have of a local authority that charges £30 for the issue of a letter saying that a road is in charge of the local authority. That surely comes within the definition of undertaking given by the Minister, because by charging £30 they are gaining by providing that service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder about the desirability of leaving in those words &ldquo;for gain&rdquo;.  Deputy Barry's amendment is to exclude them and it seems very appropriate and logical to do it when one thinks about it.  It is very hard to see why those words should <Col N="962" /> be in at all.  If the undertaking, the company or whatever are engaged in the supply and distribution of goods or in the provision of a service, what difference does their motive make?  What difference does it make whether they are doing it for gain or otherwise?  One could visualise a situation where a company, if unscrupulous enough, could set up some kind of mutual company and rake off the profits by having huge directors' fees and saying it is just the salary and that they are not in the business of making profit or gain. I think the amendment is a good one and the Minister should consider accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say, <i>apropos</i> building societies which I find of more interest than the local authority point, whether there is a distinction in law between &ldquo;for gain&rdquo; or &ldquo;for profit&rdquo; because it seems that it was in one of the many submissions made to us, or perhaps it was in one of the papers Deputy Barry kindly distributed, that such an argument is made that there is a distinction between gain and profit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from local authorities, apparently it is necessary to have the words &ldquo;acting for gain&rdquo; included in order to ensure that it includes individuals who are acting for gain, such as professionals.  Apparently it is necessary to include or cover individual persons professionally providing services for gain but it sought to exclude individual employees because if they are included acting in a trade union or a staff association capacity they would be caught by the Bill which it is not intended they would be.  In other words, if people come together for the purposes of trying to fix a wage but they are not doing that for gain, if the words &ldquo;for gain&rdquo; did not appear it seems they would be acting as concerted parties and it would not be the intention to cover them because it would cover what would be regarded as legitimate trade union or staff association activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In that respect the Company and Commercial Law Committee <Col N="963" /> of the Incorporated Law Society noted that the definition of &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; in the Bill includes the words we are talking about, &ldquo;engaged for gain&rdquo;.  They made the point that there may be bodies or associations such as trade associations, who, although not engaged for gain in the production, supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service, may be involved in anti-competitive activities contrary to section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In the committee's view such bodies should be subject to the prohibitions in section 4 in the same way as bodies engaged in business for gain.  They go on to recommend that that is a cause for deletion of the term we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's explanation unconvincing.  If the sole objective of including the words &ldquo;for gain&rdquo; is to catch an individual, I would have thought he would be caught under the undertaking. If a solicitor or dentist has a plate on the door, that would indicate an undertaking.  That leaves the trade union. I thought there would be a simpler way of dealing with the trade union situation than this which, according to what Deputy Rabbitte has just read out, is open to all sorts of interpretations and could cause horrendous problems in future and clearly is not achieving the purpose of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point Deputy Rabbitte raised about a decision made by an association who in themselves were not there for gain but who fixed prices or did something of that kind, they are caught by section 4 because it would be an agreement decision or concerted practice of an association of undertakings who have as their objective or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade, in goods or services in the State.  It is covered by that provision and that possibility does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have read that as referring back to the definition section. Whether it is between undertakings or associations of undertakings it refers back to the definition of &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; at the top of that same page which excludes the kind of trade association I adverted to earlier and it gives rise to the problem we are seeking to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The trade union position in that regard would be no different from that of a building society.  This is tricky. It might be as well for the Minister to look at it again on Report Stage.  It would be better if the intention is that certain specific categories are to be excluded from the Bill.  Whether one agrees with it or not, it should be spelled out rather than we attempt to construct the wording to fix the definition that would exclude them.  In other words, it would be better to leave out the words &ldquo;for gain&rdquo;, have it comprehensive and then exclude what you want to, that is, if you agree they should be excluded.  The position of local authorities, trade unions or building societies could be specifically examined and specifically mentioned as excluded if that is the intention and if the House so agrees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the same question as Deputy Taylor.  My objective in amendment No. 4 which I withdrew was designed to include local authorities.  I have withdrawn that amendment and now find that the objective of inserting the words &ldquo;for gain&rdquo; in line 2, page 4, was to exclude local authorities from the scope of the Bill.  I want them included. I would have thought building societies are another undertaking who should be included.  It is more difficult with trade unions.  One would not want to include them when they are negotiating for a wage increase.  An astute lawyer might decide that was a negotiation for gain, although I am not sure he would.  They should be excluded, but I would have thought the simplest thing to do so would be to write a specific clause excluding trade unions and let everybody else in, including local authorities and building societies.</P>

      <P>I am not so sure where all this leaves us.  Is the Minister accepting Deputy Taylor's suggestion that he will look at this and come back and try to redraft it on Report Stage?  I had an amendment &mdash; No. 4 &mdash; which I would have pressed to a vote but the Minister told me local authorities were included. He now says the words &ldquo;for gain&rdquo; are designed to include, among other things, local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I told the Deputy local authorities were included where they provided services for which <Col N="966" /> they are paid.  If they provide the services and are not paid, obviously they would not be included, but I think the intention here is that they be excluded anyway. Apparently some advice has been received to the effect that even when they impose service charges they are not trading for gain, they are not acting for gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that and I will do so unless the Minister can give me some undertaking in this regard.  Local authorities should be included because of the changes which are taking place in regard to local government and the change in the Government's attitude towards the funding of local authorities. Local authorities are now engaged in providing a number of services for which they charge.  Therefore, they should be subject&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>I will certainly look at the Deputy's proposal between now and Report Stage.  However, the matter is not entirely clear to me.  I do not know how we can make a distinction between local authorities who charge and those who do not charge.  It is proposed here to lump all local authorities together as one, but patently this is not the case in practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I thank the House.  I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 3, after &ldquo;service&rdquo; to insert&ldquo;, or, if not engaged for gain, that has as one of its interests or objects the review or control of anti-competitive activities&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment is connected with amendment No. 37 in my name.  If there was to be a grouping of amendment No. 7, it should have been with amendment No. 37 rather than with amendment No. 6.  The amendment also impinges on a very important section, section 6.  It deals with the question of who is entitled to enforce the law in the event of a breach of the provisions.  All sides of the House agree that that is most important.  Section 6 states that any person who is aggrieved in consequence of an agreement and so on shall have a right of relief.  Deputy Rabbitte dealt with that matter earlier. He made the point that there is a distinction between the case of a person who is aggrieved and that of a person who is injured but I do not see that there is any such distinction.  The right of action provided for under section 6, which is very important, is specifically given only to a person who is aggrieved.  It seems that no right of action is given to a person who is not aggrieved and no right of action is given to an undertaking, that is an unincorporated body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in an earlier reply conveyed that a group of consumers could get together in an association or an undertaking to enforce their rights under section 6.  Perhaps I am missing the point &mdash; if so I apologise &mdash; but an undertaking, that is an unincorporated group of consumers who get together to bring an action, would not be entitled to do so <Col N="973" /> under section 6 (1) as it stands.  First, the undertaking <i>per se</i> would not have been aggrieved although their members would have been aggrieved.  I am attempting to remedy that position by expanding the definition of an undertaking and adding &ldquo;or, if not engaged for gain, that has as one of its interests or objects the review or control of anti-competitive activities&rdquo;. In other words, if a petrol user's protection society was set up they would, if my amendment No. 37 is adopted, come within the definition of an undertaking that would be entitled to bring proceedings as provided for in section 6.  As the Bill stands that would not be possible.</P>
    <P>A person could be an individual or a limited company.  An unicorporated body would not be a person within the meaning of the Bill and consequently such an undertaking, if the Bill is left unamended, would not be entitled to bring proceedings. This amendment provides, as is the Minister's intention, that a grouping formed to protect the position of consumers or people who are adversely affected by a breach of the Bill should be entitled to avail of the remedies set out in section 6.  The amendment would have that effect if taken in conjunction with my amendment No. 37.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Deputy and I think he is trying to change the definition of the wrong thing.  He is concerned about aggrieved persons and those who might have a right of action but the definition he is trying to change is that of undertaking.  The undertaking is the person or entity against whom the action would be taken, the entity which engages in the restrictive practice, and therefore it would be wrong to change that definition.  It would become self-defeating and contradictory if the Deputy tries to cover some group of persons who might act as plaintiffs but he changes the definition of the defendant to enable that to be done.  The amendment would not do what the Deputy intends to do and for that reason I do not think he should persist with it.  If one is trying to expand the definition of a potential group of plaintiffs in a particular action one does <Col N="974" /> not do that by changing the definition of the defendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that the undertaking is the defendant. According to the Bill an undertaking is also somebody who applies for an exemption under Part II.  He may wish to appeal against the decision of the authority to refuse him a licence or an exemption but under the Bill he cannot do so.  He may be the defendant but he is also an undertaking or somebody who applies for an exemption or a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of section 6 (1), the subsection to which the Deputy referred, the undertaking is the defendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect to the Minister, to say that the undertaking is the plaintiff or the defendant makes no sense.  An undertaking might be a plaintiff or a defendant depending on which way the structure works.  An undertaking is a group of people, possibly incorporated but more usually unincorporated. It could be a plaintiff, a defendant or anything.  An undertaking is defined in the Bill as a defendant.  I am not trying to interfere with that definition but to add to it &ldquo;or, if not engaged for gain, that has as one of its interests or objects the review or control of anti-competitive activities&rdquo;.  If that is accepted by the House an undertaking for the purpose of this Bill could be the defendant who is in breach of the Competition Bill or it could be a petrol user's protection society.  If my related amendment No. 37 is accepted by the House it would add to section 6 (1), &ldquo;or any group of persons so aggrieved, or any association, company or undertaking whose members include persons so aggrieved or which was established or has as one of its objects the protection of the interest of persons so aggrieved&rdquo;.  The Minister's point does not hold up because those two amendments would provide for what is intended.  The Minister did not respond to the kernel of the point I was making. <Col N="975" /> Whereas he indicated to the House earlier that it is his intention that a group of consumers could get together to protect their right he did not respond to my point that as the Bill stands an unincorporated grouping or society would not be entitled to do so.  As section 6 (1) stands they would not constitute a person who is aggrieved in consequence of a breach of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the Deputy feels that provision should be made for more than one person in section 6 (1).  If that is so, the matter will be dealt with later.  There is no point in discussing in the context of section 6 (1) what the definition of an undertaking should be from the point of view of trying to add it as a potential plaintiff when it is perfectly clear from the terms of section 6 (1) that the undertaking in that context is the defendant and can be only the defendant. There is no point in wasting time on it. If the Deputy wants to expand the group of potential plaintiffs, and, as I understand it, that is what he wants to do, that is fair enough but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what I want to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;why does he want to expand the group of potential defendants? The definition is not just something academic, something out of the blue, it is for use, according to the Deputy in section 6 (1).  The Deputy should consider the use of the word there.  It can only be that a defendant &ldquo;shall have a right of action for relief under this section against any undertaking which is or has at any material time been...&rdquo; That is the only place in that subsection in which the word &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; is used.  Therefore, it can apply only to a defendant, because it provides for the right of action against any undertaking.  If the Deputy wants to expand the range of potential plaintiffs under section 6 (1), he should not try to do that by changing the definition of the word &ldquo;defendant&rdquo;.  That is a simple point, <Col N="976" /> and we need not go into all the technicalities. If you wish to expand the range of potential plaintiffs you do not so do by changing the definition of the defendant.</P>

      <P>The Minister introduced the Bill on the basis that it reflects Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. The Treaty of Rome coincides precisely with what I am saying.  If we are introducing into Irish law the rules of competition as laid down in the EC under the Treaty of Rome we should not change the words.  The Minister when introducing the Bill, at his press conference and again here today said that the objective of the legislation was to bring what have been termed the best competition laws in the world into effect in the State.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that some aggrieved persons will test this legislation at some stage by an appeal to the High Court and the High Court will base their decisions presumably on the body of case law in Europe as to whether this legislation has been breached.  If it is the Minister's intention to use the European model in drawing up the legislation, in applying the rules of competition and in adjudicating court cases, the more accurately we stick to the wording in the Treaty of Rome, the less chance there is of appeals going from here to the European Court and the less chance there is of misunderstandings about precisely what is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment No. 8 suggests that the wording of Article 85 is what the Minister should use in section 4 of the Bill.  My <Col N="982" /> amendment and Article 85 both use the words &ldquo;which may affect&rdquo;, whereas the Minister uses the words &ldquo;which have as their object&rdquo;.  Article 85 has stood the test of time and has been the subject of court cases in the European Community since the treaties were signed.  We should not change the words without good reason.  I am waiting for the Minister to tell me why he has changed them.  My amendment would be as near as possible to the wording of Article 85.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (1) refers to &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of this subsection&rdquo;. I did not include that in my amendment because I do not know what it means, although it appears frequently in legislation. Paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) are taken precisely from the rules of competition of section 1 of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome except for paragraph (e) which says:</P>
    <P>(e)  make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of additional obligations which by their nature or according to commercial usage have no connection with the subject of such contracts. </P>
    <P>That is what the Minister says.  The Treaty of Rome says:</P>
    <P>(e)  make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties or supplementary obligations which by their nature or according to commercial usage have no connection with the subject of such contracts. </P>
    <P>One word was changed there.  The word &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo; was changed to &ldquo;additional&rdquo;.  That does not seem like a typing error or a slip of the tongue in dictating.  It seems to be a deliberate change by the Minister and perhaps one of the lawyers &mdash; Deputy Taylor &mdash; might tell us the difference betwee &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo; and &ldquo;additional&rdquo;.  There must be a reason for the Minister changing this.  The Minister has been saying for some time that this is based on European law and, if that is so, we should stick to the wording of European law because it will be understood in Europe.  Also, if cases are brought before the High Court <Col N="983" /> here they will be able to adjudicate on the wording in Europe, not on the wording contained in our Act even though we recognise that they are under no obligaton to do so.</P>
    <P>Why has the word &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo; in subsection (1) (e) been changed to &ldquo;additional&rdquo;?  I am not sure I understand the difference, but if there is a difference I should like to be assured that there is a point to it and if there is no difference, for the sake of neatness and exactness we should stick to what is in the Treaty of Rome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is probably familiar with the comment from the CII in relation to this; they take objection to this particular clause &ldquo;in any part of the State&rdquo; and suggest it might cause problems in the Irish context because of the size of the Irish market.  They make the point that it does not mirror the wording in Article 85 and that, because we are such a small economy, it may not be in our interest to subdivide the market further.  They comment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>It leaves open the possibility that distortions of competition in a market smaller than the national one may be actionable.  By sub-dividing the already small market in Ireland, Irish companies seeking to achieve a certain size on the Irish market in order to ensure economies of scale to operate in the wider EC market may be impeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the purpose in going out of the way to include &ldquo;goods, trades, etc., in the State or in any part of the State&rdquo;?  Is <Col N="984" /> the suggestion that if a particular brewery have a dominant position in the southern capital they may be guilty of an abuse of dominant position in the context of the southern capital as distinct from in the national context?  I am not clear why it should be there.  Since we are all agreed that it is necessary to encourage the development of large scale players in the economy who can compete in the wider European environment, why should we seek to subdivide an already small market within the constraints of the Irish economy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 tabled by Deputy Barry is covered by amendment No. 9.  The intention of the amendment is to make the text of the Bill as close as possible to that of the Treaty because it will facilitate interpretation and strengthen the analogy with Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty as set out and drawn in the Long Title.  Obviously, when you adapt a Treaty such as the Rome Treaty to national law you have to do it <i>mutatis mutandis.</i>  For example, you must leave out of it the first reason given in Article 85 for its existence, that the following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the Common Market because the question of compatibility with the Common Market of the Twelve member states does not arise in national law.  You must also leave out the phrase in the middle of section 1 of Article 85, &ldquo;which may affect trade between member states&rdquo;, because national law has no jurisdiction over trade between member states and does not apply here. However, you must substitute &ldquo;where it does apply&rdquo; and that is why we used the phrase &ldquo;within the State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if there is an undersirable practice in part of the State but not in the whole State it would be most unsatisfactory for a company to say they agree they are abusing their dominance in 25 counties but that they are not abusing it in County Donegal and, therefore, you cannot do anything about it or be restrictive in any competitive agreements into which they have entered, because, as it does not include County Donegal it does <Col N="985" /> not cover the whole State.  Obviously, that would be unsatisfactory, so it is proposed to include in this amendment &ldquo;part of the State&rdquo; which is not incompatible with Article 85 as applied <i>mutatis mutandis.</i></P>
    <P>In the same spirit &mdash; and for the same reason &mdash; I am perfectly happy to accept amendment No. 11 in Deputy Barry's name which substitutes &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;additional&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Supplementary&rdquo; is in Article 85 (1) (e).  The reason &ldquo;additional&rdquo; was used is that the draftsman regarded the word &ldquo;additional&rdquo; as more commonly used in common law in this sense than the essentially French word &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo;. However, the meaning is the same and it does not greatly matter.  For the sake of making it easier, particularly for the sake of applying the decisions of the European Court here more readily, I am anxious to stick as closely as I can, within reason, to the wording in the Treaty.  For that reason I will accept amendment No. 11.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 does not refer to &ldquo;parts of the State&rdquo;, it refers to the entire State and, for that reason, the wording would not be satisfactory.  It also uses the words &ldquo;which may affect trade&rdquo; which would be inappropriate or inapplicable because they are taken from the phrase that covers trade between member states in Article 85 (1) and, since that cannot arise here, it is inappropriate to use it. For that reason, I ask Deputy Barry to withdraw amendment No. 8 and to agree to amendment No. 9.  I will then agree to amendment No. 11.</P>

      <P>On the question of the &ldquo;part of the State&rdquo; referred to by Deputy Barry and the Minister, I am curious why a distinction is drawn in sections 4 and 5. In section 4 the anti-competition agreement position, the expression used is &ldquo;or in any part of the State&rdquo; whereas section 5 states, &ldquo;in the State or in a substantial part of the State&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Minister for Education is present &mdash; the Minister of State is also welcome &mdash; to listen to the debate.  I hope, as I requested her to do, that over the weekend she reconsidered her decision with regard to the proposal put forward by my colleague, Deputy Higgins, whom I compliment for introducing the Bill.  The Bill has received the support of a wide range of interested parties.  I have no doubt it has the support of the Minister's party, if not the Government.  I hope she will not act like a spoiled child and sulk because she did not think of the idea.  She should be generous and big-hearted in responding to the proposal.  I cannot accept the advice &mdash; I am sure the Minister does not accept it either &mdash; of the Minister's legal advisers that it is not possible to implement the Bill as it stands. If the Minister's legal advisers cannot overcome this obstacle I suggest that she should sack them as it is obvious they do not have much ability.  There is no major obstacle in the way of implementing the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is much to commend the Bill.  It seeks to ensure that parents and teachers are represented on vocational education committees. In her contribution on Wednesday last the Minister stated that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> emphasised the importance of the role of parents in the education of their children and recognised the promotion of parental involvement in the education of their children as an essential strategy of educational policy and practice.  I could not agree more.  If the Minister is serious then she should implement the proposals contained in the Bill introduced by Deputy Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a great admirer of the vocational education system and I am chairman of the Cavan parents group.  Therefore, I <Col N="987" /> am aware of what the system has to offer. It is one of the leaders in education.  It has set headlines which have been followed by the private colleges which I support and which have a role to play. The competition between the vocational education system and the private colleges is healthy in that it keeps teachers on their toes.  Parents at this time of the year ask themselves the big question where will they send their children &mdash; to the vocational school or to the private college. The choice is theirs.  However, some people have adopted the attitude that the vocational education system caters for certain children only &mdash; children considered to be slow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or children from a certain section of society.  I disagree totally. Children from all sections of society should avail of this system.  For this reason I am annoyed that people in public life seek places on vocational education committees but would not send their children to vocational schools as they do not consider those schools to be good enough.  However, they like the privilege of being members of vocational education committees so that they can make statements and pronouncements, advocate how the schools should be run and be quoted in the press.  I am annoyed that parents who are prepared to send their children to vocational schools are not represented on the committees.</P>
      <P>Who understands the needs of children more than the teachers or their parents? They should have an input in the committees. I suggest to the Minister that she take on board the proposal put forward by Deputy Higgins in the interests of the vocational education system, the students attending those schools and the parents who support them.  The Minister should ensure that they are represented on the committees who decide on the courses and finance for a particular school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say, having mentioned <Col N="988" /> already my local vocational school in Cavan, that we now have a third level centre in Cavan town which is second to none.  It offers industralists and business people, students who are highly qualified in the areas of office management and computers.  A pre-nursing course is now on offer.  Those who complete a two year course at the College of Further Studies in Cavan town under the umbrella of the vocational education system are given the option of moving on to Athlone to do the diploma course.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an díospóireacht seo faoin mBille Gairmoideachais (Leasú) 1991.  Tugann sé seans dúinn uilig sa Dáil seo an córas gairmoideachais sa Stát a anailiú agus ár dtuairimí agus ár smaointe a chur os comhair an Aire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it provides us with an opportunity to debate education. Indeed, one should welcome any opportunity to debate any aspect of education, be it primary, second level or third level.  This debate presents us with an opportunity to focus our attention on current educational issues and to ask where we are going in education. However, I have one problem with the Bill even though I commend its principle. Deputy Boylan spoke about the commitment of parents to the vocational education system and the perceptions that some people have of vocational education. He also said he is aware of some <Col N="989" /> members of vocational education committees who, despite their public pronouncements, do not seem to have any faith in the vocational education system. That has not been my experience in Dublin.  I am delighted to see Deputy Mac Giolla in the House as he is a very active and committed member of the committee of which I am a member.</P>
    <P>I wish to say to Deputy Higgins, and those on the other side of the House, that everyone supports the principle of teacher and parental involvement in the decision-making process.  Certainly, this side of the House support it.  The Minister should be commended for the manner in which she has promoted this principle in recent years.  She has made public statements and issued circular letters on this matter.  I am aware of this from my dealings with primary, vocational and voluntary second level schools.  She also supports very strongly the idea of parent associations.  As Deputy Boylan rightly pointed out, the Government underlined their commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> There is no doubt that they stand full square behind the Minister.</P>
    <P>In recent years parents have become much more interested in education and in the progress their children and their teenagers are making in the educational system.  They have shown an acute awareness of what is required for the delivery of the service and this is demonstrated most clearly by their attendance at parent-teacher meetings.  I was delighted to attend parent-teacher meetings over the past five years.  Indeed, I had to queue for up to two to three hours, and the parents were prepared to sit and wait to meet with the relevant teacher to find out about their children's progress.  It is great to see parents taking a deep interest in how the system is working, in the quality of the service and how it is meeting their children's requirements to go out and take their place in society, whether to follow an academic career or to meet the challenges of the world at large.</P>
    <P>It is only logical and sensible that greater facilities be made available for parental participation in education at <Col N="990" /> both primary and post-primary level. Perhaps it was the realisation of the need for a role for parents and teachers in decision making that prompted Deputy Higgins to bring this Bill before us, but although I have a tremendous regard for Deputy Higgins, and other members of the teaching profession with whom he is associated, I think the focus of the Bill is too narrow.  Apart from the problems the Minister outlined &mdash; I believe she consulted with the best legal advice and was told the Bill was flawed and inoperable &mdash; I can see difficulties in the operation of the Bill from my experience as a member of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  The perspective of the Bill is quite narrow.  The City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee support parental and teacher involvement in the decision making process. I am sure the Bill intends to deal with these areas where it is perceived that there is not enough parental involvement.</P>
    <P>The City of Dublin VEC are very limited in terms of the totality of the service but they provide a service to the Dublin city community: there is a rapidly increasing proportion of post-leaving certificate students in the second level schools, and the statistics will prove that; they also provide a prison education service and administer six third level colleges.  In fact the City of Dublin VEC are way ahead of what Deputy Higgins proposes.  There are student groups in our second level schools because it was decided that the many students in post-leaving certificate courses should have an input into the decision making in the schools.  The prison education service is being encouraged to look at ways and means of coming up with ideas to further enhance and make more efficient the type of service being delivered to prisoners.  A school psychological service and a huge adult education programme is provided.  All these areas can be looked at because they are part of the totality of the service that the City of Dublin VEC deliver to the community.</P>
    <P>The best legal advice indicates that the Bill is flawed.  I might add that it deals <Col N="991" /> with a very small and decreasing part of the totality of the service provided by the vocational education system.  There are also problems, as the Minister has outlined, in the selection of parent and teacher representatives.  I do not want to go into this point as the Minister has covered it quite adequately but we must ask who will control the system, who will draw up the register of electors, and who will monitor the system overall.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to the amendment of section 8 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, by the insertion of subsection (3B) which proposes a formula of words for the cessation of membership of parent and teacher representatives on the vocational education committee.  I believe that the draftsperson who formulated this did so in a weak fashion because it is quite possible to envisage a situation where parents and teachers could continue as members of the VEC for an indefinite period.  I do not think this is very democratic.  Part of the great strength of the VEC system is the democratic principle enshrined in the 1930 Act. Parents and teachers could continue to be representatives for a long number of years if, for example, in the case of parents, their children are students within the system and, in the case of teachers, they continue to be employed on the staff in the VEC area.  I cannot see any provision in subsection (3B) which overcomes that problem but perhaps I could be enlightened.  This is a very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>When I first looked at this Bill I was immediately prompted to examine the existing situation in the VEC.  Obviously we all look to the committees we have worked with, or the most contiguous ones.  I analysed how we had decided on the composition of the Vocational Education Committee in 1985.  Believe it or not, there are seven teachers on the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committees from primary, secondary, vocational and third level both university and third level vocational colleges, three members from industry &mdash; and I will speak about them later &mdash; three very <Col N="992" /> experienced trade unionists and a student representative.  I have included Deputy Mac Giolla in a number of categories because as Members are well aware, he is very experienced at trade union and other levels.  Members can make a wide ranging contribution and there is an abundance of talents and skills available to the committee.  I believe the overall contribution is very effective and analytical and members are always looking at ways and means of doing things more efficiently and in the best interest of delivering a service to our students.</P>

      <P>The Minister has the right focus in relation to devolution. The principle of the Bill means looking to other partners in education to devolve to them powers to participate.  We must look to local boards of management and devolve to them real powers and responsibilities for making decisions at local level.  Committees can be important co-ordinating bodies but boards of management must have the powers to enable them to make decisions.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision to publish a Green Paper in the autumn.  The principles behind this Bill will be much more meaningfully and substantially addressed by making the case subsequent to the publication of that Green Paper.  I look forward to the substantial debate which will follow, leading to a White Paper.  I am convinced that the future for educational reform will be addresed in a wide ranging debate to examine the real meaning of devolution in the delivery of educational services.  That devolution will look towards localised boards of management where real decisions should be made.</P>

      <P>It is of some significance that we in Dáil Éireann are debating a key educational issue on the opening day of the main State examinations, the <Col N="993" /> group, intermediate and leaving certificate examinations which started this morning.  I am sure I speak for everybody here when I send our best wishes to all those taking the examinations.  It is a tough time for students and they have the backing of all of us.</P>
      <P>My party have no difficulty in giving full support to the aims and objectives of this Bill.  We have nothing but sympathy for what this Bill sets out to do.  Until recent times parents have been a wasted resource in the formal education process. Any measure that would seek to enable parents to play a more meaningful role in our education system should be encouraged and supported.  Many significant strides have been made in recent years.  The growth of the National Parents Council is a good example and a vast improvement.  The emphasis put on the development of a more formal, active and dynamic role for parents in education in the PESP gives grounds for further optimism.  The proposal to provide an annual grant of £25,000 to support the work of the National Parents Council is concrete evidence of the intention of this Minister to support parents groups in every practical way possible.  I commend the Minister on that but much more remains to be done.</P>
      <P>This debate has taken the matter one step further.  The excellent contributions made by the proposer of this Bill and by subsequent speakers have helped to crystallise the issues even further and pave the way for further progress.  I have today received a clear assurance from the Minister that this week she has written to all the county councils asking that they specifically be mindful of the need in the composition of the new VECs to include representatives of parents and teachers. She has made a very strong recommendation to that effect and I have no doubt that the recommendation will not be ignored.  There is scope within the 1930 Act for the inclusion of representatives of parents and teachers.  I am a member of the city of Cork VEC to which representatives of parents and teachers have been formally selected.  They have a meaningful role to play in deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> I have no doubt that the cross-party agreement which has been expressed in this debate will contribute to significant change in the composition of the incoming VECs.  That must be welcomed. The debate which started last week has played a role in bringing about that situation.</P>
    <P>I am equally confident that the principle contained in this Bill will be more forcefully and more comprehensively advanced in the context of the debate that will derive from the impending Green Paper.  For all its merits, this Bill is much too narrowly focused.  Proper provision must be made for the inclusion of parents and teachers, the main practitioners in the field, at every level of education.  The ultimate objective must be to ensure that parents and teachers are adequately and formally represented on the board of management of every school.  That will be brought about in the forthcoming Education Bill.  Debate in the context of the Green Paper will give all of us a fresh opportunity to advance the argument.  I am fully confident that legislation will be put in place which will enable the aims and objectives of this Bill to be realised not only in the context of VECs but at every level of education.</P>
    <P>For that reason the Progressive Democrats will not be voting in favour of this Bill.  We are fully convinced that the objectives will be taken on board, extended and expanded upon and fully implemented in the context of the Education Bill.  Legal reasons have been outlined by the Minister as to why we would not be supporting the Bill in any case.  I am optimistic that the aims and objectives of this Bill will be met in the context of legislation due in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputy Quill has no interest in the GAA.  I want to thank the Minister for her great interest in education and particularly for the boost she has given to vocational education over the years she has been in office.  I have had detailed discussions with her about many vocational schools and I am happy that she has concentrated her efforts because there has been a tendency to look down on VEC schools. However, when schools had plenty of pupils, when there was a surplus of numbers, the VECs never refused any pupil. The VEC gave the broadest education to the most needy.</P>
      <P>I agree with the principle of the present Bill.  However, I will try not to be cynical about the timing of it.  The tradition Fine Gael complain about is none other than the one that has been practicised by their party.

There is a Green Paper coming forward and the Fine Gael Bill, as the Minister rightly pointed out, is inadequate in its provisions for representatives.  However, there are a number of other inadequacies in it that need to be looked at in a Green Paper, and one is the rights of parents. Many members of the VEC, while not elected as parent representatives, are parents and obviously their views come across.  We all have a great respect for parents and their total understanding of the system.  They are vital to it because they are the fund raisers.  They are the people who should have an input in this <Col N="996" /> area because it is their children who attend the schools.  They can be a great help to the VEC, but provision for their representation on the committee must be properly formulated and put down as a legal proposition.  Also every school should have a parents association.  At the moment there are quite a number of schools who do not and that needs to be addressed.  The Minister has encouraged every school to set up such a committee.</P>
      <P>In regard to the suggestion that two parents should be on the committee, I would be thrilled if that were the case. When I became a member of the vocational education committee I stopped reports coming forward every month to the effect that such and such a teacher had a day off because his aunt died or because he had a pain in his head or his house burned or whatever.  I stopped that system of circulating such reports to all the members of the committee because those are personal matters.</P>
      <P>The appointment of teachers has been criticised in this House.  I am chairman of a board of interviewers and I can assure the House &mdash; and our chief executive officer will stand over it &mdash; that any appointment we have made in the last number of years has, in our best judgment, been to the benefit of the VEC.  I decry this assertion that politicians do not have the judgment to decide something.  I see this continually and it is aimed at taking away the power from local democracy.  It is a constant cry that is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A power I want to see coming in, and which is vital, is the power to dismiss a teacher who is not coming up to standard, who is not playing the game, who is not enhancing the chances in life of the children. That power does not exist at present.  The vast majority of teachers, 90 per cent, are perfect but, as in any walk of life, there will be the few who are not.  I am aware of many instances, particularly the one where there is a legal dilemma of a teacher having been suspended for three years.  Neither he, the committee or the Department can move and that person is totally unsuited to be involved in education.  If there is a system <Col N="997" /> of appointments there must be a system of dismissal.  God knows we, in this House, know how easy it is to be dismissed on any occasion.  We have seen colleagues dismissed over the years, and that is the will of the people. However, we need to introduce a system where there can be a review of teachers, particularly if a teacher has a problem with teaching.</P>
    <P>More and more people teaching in vocational schools are taking in disadvantaged children not only because the other schools reject them but because they want to take them in, because they are the school system that believes in promoting education and has the widest space in which those children can expand whatever abilities they have.  That is all the more reason we need to ensure that the teachers of the most disadvantaged children are the best so that those children will have come chance in life, some chance to develop the qualities they have. While recognising that teachers must be represented on the board, a corollary to that must also be that those teachers should recognise that some of their colleagues, a very small minority, are not living up to the required standard and need to be dismissed.  A system to allow for that must be included in the Green Paper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite what Deputy Davern said about being opportunistic or some such <Col N="998" /> thing, and despite the fact that he criticised my party for having a system in the VEC that was the same as his party's, it would be dreadful if we in this House got completely paralysed and never did anything.  I hope Deputy Davern will never be a selector on the Tipperary team when Cork are beating them because he will never make a switch.  He will play the same team right to the finish.</P>
    <P>The pious platitudes of the Opposition during the debate on this Bill were unbelievable. The teachers are the best in the country and so are the parents and they all deserve the best, but for some strange reason, the Bill cannot be amended because it is flawed.  Since I was elected to this House every Bill introduced has been amended from the most serious Bill to the most trivial.  It is unacceptable for the Minister to I say she cannot agree to the Bill because she could not amend it.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to provide for at least two representatives.  The Minister in her speech said that could be ten, 20 or 50 and luckily enough she stopped at 50. What is wrong with the Minister putting in a simple amendment providing for not more than two?  There is nothing magic about amending Bills that come before this House.  All the wonderful speeches from the Government side about teachers and parents amount to hypocrisy when it comes to the crunch and nothing happens.  The Progressive Democrats support the Bill, but they cannot support it.  Deputy Fitzgerald supports it but he cannot support it.  Everybody wants the Bill but nobody can support it.  Is it not incredible in this day and age to hear that nonsense in the House?  Our VECs consist of some people who are very dedicated, who are experts in education and who have spent their lifetime contributing to education.  We have to admit there are people on VECs who are not really interested in education and are there for reasons I will not go into, but when we say we cannot see our way to giving two places to parents and two places to teachers there is something radically wrong.</P>
    <P>There is a song and dance made about the parents.  We are asked, how will we <Col N="999" /> arrange the voting for the election of parents?  It was put to me that I would find it very difficult if we had that system in Carlow.  I was asked if we would head off to Donegal to get the parents there to vote in the election of two parents in Carlow.  Is it terribly difficult to know what parents would vote for their VEC representatives in their own county and their own region?  Could anything be more silly than seeing difficulty in that or in who will run the election, who will count the votes, or where they will be counted?  Has anything be trivialised as much as this Bill has been by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats?</P>
    <P>I find it incredible that the Minister refuses to face reality.  It boils down to a cliché, either put up or shut up.  The Minister is faced with that dilemma.  No matter how much praise she lavishes on parents and teachers, no matter what she is going to do in a Green Paper or even a Browne paper, if she does not accept this Bill she will be seen clearly to be playing around with words, a trick-o-the-loop act, saying one thing and doing another.  It is time she acknowledged the role of parents and teachers properly by accepting this Bill.  If she does not accept it and say she will amend its flaws, then the parents, the teachers and those who are backing this Bill will see her attitude for what it is, a charade.</P>
    <P>As I sat listening to the debate I could not help thinking of Saint Augustine who said, &ldquo;Lord, make me pure not just yet&rdquo;. Members on the Government side must have learned that phrase and paraphrased it because they are saying, &ldquo;Lord, give us representation but not just yet&rdquo;.  I do not know why.  Maybe the Lord will speak to them at some stage.  I hope sincerely there has been a change of mind since the Minister made her speech.  If there has not been she will be accused of using words that mean nothing.  All that has been said ignores the important role of parents and teachers who should by right &mdash; not by the grace of a political party &mdash; be allowed to be members of a VEC.  There should be definite representation for teachers and parents.  As <Col N="1000" /> Deputy Davern said, the majority of members of VECs are parents but they do not represent a parents' committee. There may be teachers on those committees but they do not represent the teachers officially, they represent political parties.</P>
    <P>This is a very simple Bill which should be accepted and I hope it will because hope springs eternal in the human breast.</P>

      <P>I support the concept and general purpose behind Deputy Higgins' Bill and I agree with the general arguments he made last week in support of it.  The House should agree that it is high time the practice of appointees being selected for VECs in many cases solely on the basis of their political convictions was abolished.  I do not know why that continues into the nineties.  There may have been reasons for it in the past, but that system is wrong.  It tends to erode public confidence in the VECs, and the trust which teachers and, in some cases, parents have in it.  We saw that last year when at attempt was made to change the system of appointment and have the Local Appointments Commission appoint teachers rather than the VECs.  There are suspicions in people's minds as to whether the selections are made on a fair basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1930 Act is the only education Act we have.  We can be proud of it because it is so flexible that more than 60 years after its enactment it is still bang up to date for the nineties as is proved every day in VECs.  It has been away ahead in meeting the challenges that have faced us, particularly in the past decade or so when changes came so rapidly in the whole social system and the education system bringing about a need for alterations in curricula and teaching methods. Greater difficulties arose among children with remedial problems, psychological problems and so on in schools.  The VEC system met those changes ahead of the <Col N="1001" /> other education system, and that was due to the foresight and vision in the 1930 Act.</P>
    <P>As many speakers have said, the VEC system is non-selective.  It is open to everybody.  There is no bar, good, bad or indifferent.  Every child is welcome and the system gives total equality of education to all.  It is publicly accountable, non-denominational, coeducational and democratic.  The democratic nature of the system is very important and I agree with Deputy Davern that it should be protected and retained.  However, democracy is not a system of grabbing all.  I do not know why one political group would want to have total control over the VEC system in the nineties or to dominate it.  Rather than presenting a vision of democracy, that paints a picture of packed juries in the public mind.  Why do parties want to pack the VEC system with their own kind?  Thus raise suspicions which in most cases are unfounded. Nevertheless, it is done either to repay a political favour or for whatever reason and it is time that system was ended.</P>
    <P>Teachers and parents are more involved in the education system, the parents through their children and the teachers through the stress and difficulties in schools and so on.  It is only proper that they should have a statutory right to be represented on VECs.  Third level students who attend regional technical colleges are more and more a force in the VEC system and should also be represented on VECs.</P>
    <P>A total of eight councillors can be elected to VECs &mdash; there can be five but I do not know of any local authority who only select five; I believe they all elect eight &mdash; and this leaves only six more places to be filled.  I have some doubts about the need for two parents and two teachers on each VEC because this would only leave two other places to be filled. As I said, third level students should have a representative on the VEC and, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, perhaps in time to come second level students might also need representation.  A place should also be found on VECs for some other expertise, <Col N="1002" /> for example, a trade unionist or industrialist from the area who could contribute to the vocational education system.  For that reason one parent and one teacher representative should be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Bill can be amended and I think the author, Deputy Higgins, agrees that it is open to amendment.  If the Bill is given a Second Reading, amendments can be put down on Committee Stage.  Of course, the Minister can also put down amendments because, as I said, some amendments are needed to the Bill.</P>
    <P>There has not been any controversy about the manner of selecting the teacher representative.  Presumably everyone recognises that this would be a fairly simple procedure.  The teachers in the VEC system are members of the TUI and an election can be organised by each VEC to select a teacher representative for the VEC.  However, there has been some controversy about how a parent should be selected and reference has been made to the great difficulties involved in electing a parent representative.  Parents of students in the VEC system are members of the Parent' Association of Vocational Schools and Community Colleges.  There is a parent's association in each VEC area and they are members of the National Parent's Association.  This association is affiliated to the National Parents' Council where they have four members.  This association is well organised and capable of organising an election for parent representation on VECs.</P>
    <P>In case the Minister has some difficulties with that proposal, I should like to refer to the constitution of the Parents' Association for Vocational Schools and Community Colleges which states that membership of the association shall be open to parents or guardians of full-time second level pupils of vocational schools and community colleges and that membership shall cease when they cease to have second level pupils at vocational schools or colleges.  That system could easily be adapted and included in the <Col N="1003" /> Bill.  I ask the Minister to support this proposal.</P>
    <P>It is inadequate for the Minister to send letters to VECs recommending that they elect a parent.  Many VECs would say they have parent representation already &mdash; they have selected political appointees who happen to be parents.  They will say they already have parent representation. I understand from the parents' association to which I have referred that only two VECs have full fledged members with full voting rights, etc.  who are parents &mdash; Monaghan VEC and North Tipperary VEC.  There are observers on the South Tipperary, Laois and Kilkenny VECs.  Deputy Quill seemed to suggest that there was parent representation on the Cork VEC but according to the parents' association this is not the case.</P>

      <P>The South Tipperary VEC have a parent as an observer. However, they are probably ahead of many other VECs.  Deputy Davern said that since there is a system of appointments there should also be a system of dismissals.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that there is a system of dismissals. I am a member of a VEC who dismissed a teacher.  While I accept that this may be a long process, I do not understand Deputy Davern's difficulty as this can and does happen.  However, that has nothing to do with this Bill.  In the interests of the VEC system, it is essential that parents and teachers should have a statutory right to be represented on VECs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I take exception to something Deputy Davern said.  He said that the VEC system was local democracy in action, but unfortunately he did not elaborate on how VECs were formed.  It is important to clarify that on a committee of 14, usually eight members are county councillors and the other six members are nominees of the county council &mdash; it is important to emphasise <Col N="1004" /> that they are nominees of the county council.  How will the election of two parents and two teachers to every VEC, giving a total of 12 elected representatives and two nominees, make the system more democratic than the present system?  I should like to emphasise that point for the benefit of Deputy Davern.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I want to emphasise that one can see more local democracy in action through any form of election than nomination.</P>
      <P>Some months ago in this House we debated the appointment of teachers in vocational schools.  On that occasion we heard speaker after speaker on the Government side emphasise the importance of local democracy.  I hope some of those speakers who will troop in here this evening will abstain and allow the Bill to go through, but I suppose that might be asking a bit much of Members on the Government benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of the points raised by the Minister last week, the first of which relates to the number of people appointed to VECs.  My colleague, Deputy Browne, dealt with this point at length.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not outline suitable amendments to the Bill.  She spoke at <Col N="1005" /> great length about the difficulties involved in electing parents and teachers to VECs.  I believe this would be possible by a simple amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister queried the format of elections for possible parent teacher representatives and the duration of their appointments. Surely the Minister is merely finding fault in a very petty way and eliminating what is essentially a farseeing and welcome concept of teacher and parent involvement in the education of our young people.  The Minister said: &ldquo;There are many other serious flaws in the Bill as it is drafted&rdquo; but unfortunately she mentioned only two points and did not go on to clarify any more flaws that appeared in this Bill.  Was she just saying out of a sense of frustration that she wanted to accept it but was not allowed. Both as a teacher and a parent I am aware of the important role of teachers and parents in the education of their children. Our Constitution acknowledges the role of the family as &ldquo;the primary and natural educator of the child&rdquo;.  Indeed, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> endorses the importance of parental involvement in education as follows:</P>
    <P>Positive parental interest is crucial to a child's educational attainment.  It must, therefore, be an essential strategy of educational policy and practice to promote parental involvement in the education of their children. </P>
    <P>What Bill could emphasise and set out more clearly the thoughts expressed in that programme?  The Bill, as introduced by my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, surely that brings that statement in the programme to fruition.  Unfortunately, the Government do not seem able to accept it.</P>
    <P>Parents are at present involved in the management of primary schools and in many secondary schools.  Unfortunately, the parents of children who attend vocational schools have no such involvement, they are eliminated from this crucial role.  They have no say in the ethos, control and management of their children's education.  The Bill before us <Col N="1006" /> today can put this serious omission right, but sadly the Government are opposing it.  How does this conform to their commitment to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress?</i>  Perhaps the Minister intends to introduce boards of management for individual vocational schools in her long awaited Green Paper.  In her speech last week she said:</P>
    <P>My concern is that they (the parents) be involved where it really counts and, ... that is at the level of the individual school itself. </P>
    <P>Does this mean that she intends to set up boards of management in individual vocational schools, or perhaps she intends to curtail, amalgamate or even abolish VECs.  In my own County Westmeath we have a very active and progressive vocational education committee. I must express disappointment that the Minister continues to allow the situation to exist in County Westmeath where the chief executive education officer is in an acting capacity.  Unfortunately the situation is the same in eight committees throughout the country. Does this show the Minister's lack of commitment to VECs?  Can she not make up her mind whether to appoint these people or to take the appropriate action? Why is she leaving them in such insecurity? I hope she will take action in this area very promptly.  I am proud to say that County Westmeath VEC has a teacher nominated for the past 12 years by the TUI to represent the teachers on that board.  It has worked well.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I hope some of the Government Deputies, perhaps the Progressive Democrats, will decide that they will not pay lip service to the involvement of parents in education but that they may decide to support the Bill this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment everybody who has been involved in this very constructive debate. Indeed, I compliment Deputy Higgins for introducing the Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 1991.  It has proved to be a very worthwhile discussion.  At <Col N="1007" /> the outset I want to repeat the Minister's commitment to partnership in education. More than any other Minister for Education, over the past four years she has shown in a very practical way that she wants to involve parents and teachers in every aspect of education policy.  The best example is the way the parents' councils and associations from local to national level has been given a central role in both the development of education policy and the administration of education throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Also it is fair to say that in the last four years since Deputy Mary O'Rourke became Minister for Education not one relevant committee has been formed in the Department of Education that did not have a central role for both parents and teachers.  Consequently the Minister is committed to the principle and the spirit of this Bill and would be anxious to go along with the Bill if that were possible. Unfortunately it is not possible and since last week the Minister has looked again at the possibilities.  It is not as simple as Deputy Browne suggested &mdash; that we would make an amendment where we would say &ldquo;not less than two parents or not more than two parents&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, this Bill would have to be dropped and a new Bill introduced if the provisions for which the drafter wished to provide were to be taken into account because the Bill totally ignores the existing provisions relating to the composition of VECs which are explicitly spelt out in the 1930 Act.  I want to quote again from the Minister's speech the reason it is not possible to make a simple amendment as has been proposed.  She said:</P>
      <P>To achieve what the drafter of the Bill, apparently wants to achieve, the Bill would have to provide that in addition to the membership already specified in the Act there should also be additional members not less than two of which will be parents, etc., and not less than two of which will be teachers, etc.  Therefore, the provision is fundamentally flawed... </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> One must contrast this with the existing provision in section 8 (2) which specifies that there shall be 14 members of the committee &ldquo;of whom not less than five nor more than eight shall be persons who are members of such Council&rdquo;.  I want to reiterate that it is not possible to make the amendments suggested.  That would only be possible if we were to drop this Bill and introduce another in its place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Minister is anxious to accommodate the implementation of the principles in this Bill she has made a number of efforts to try so far as possible to be accommodating.  It is fair to say that Deputy Higgins has given a new impetus and a new status to participation in education.  He has given expression here this evening and on the last occasion to the principle of partnership in education.  What is now required is that we introduce proper legislation to properly give expression to that principle.  That is something the Minister is most anxious to do.</P>
      <P>From a very practical point of view, the Minister has written to all the local authorities asking them to include, as far as possible, parents and teachers on VECs following the forthcoming election. I will quote from the letter from the Secretary of the Department of Education to each local authority as follows:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education, Mary O'Rourke, T.D., wishes that Vocational Education Committees be clearly seen to be democratic and representative and wishes to stress, accordingly, the desirability of parent and teacher representatives being included in the membership of such committees....</P>
      <P>The Minister considers that each Vocational Education Committee also should have among its membership a representative of parents whose children are attending vocational schools or community colleges in the relevant Vocational Education Scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> In Circular Letter F.58/85 issued on 3 July, 1985, Local Authorities were requested to take account of the desirability of parent representation when electing members to Vocational Education Committees.  The Minister for Education now wishes to reiterate that requests that a teachers' representative be elected to VECs in line with the policy outlined above. </P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that if there is not a positive response to this request by the Minister, it is the Minister's intention to carry out an audit following the local elections which will indicate the number of teachers and parents who have been appointed to VECs.  If following that audit it is evident that parents and teachers are not adequately represented on VECs, and if it is found that there is a need for legislation, the Minister would be prepared to have the Government consider the introduction of legislation to correct the difficulties in the Bill and give practical implementation to the principles contained in it.</P>
    <P>The Bill has had the effect of giving all parties in the House an opportunity to voice their support for the important principle of partnership in education, particularly with regard to parents.  It is fair to say that teachers have been represented in the past, albeit through their political involvement, but parents have not been represented to the degree we would like.  It is important to point out that following the election in 1985 many local authorities in response to demands by the TUI, appointed to the vocational education committees teachers who were employed by the relevant committees.  In Galway we appointed the TUI representative who was proposed.  That person has been very active and, indeed, one of the finest members of the vocational education committee in Galway.  It is Fianna Fáil's intention that teachers and parents be appointed to VECs throughout the country following the local elections.</P>
    <P>We welcome the initiative by Deputy <Col N="1010" /> Higgins in this respect.  I hope the principle he has put forward, albeit in a Bill which is not operable, will result in local authorities and political parties taking on board the principle we all want to see implemented.  I assure the House that if that principle is not taken on board the Minister will certainly consider the introduction of legislation which will ensure adequate involvement by parents and teachers on VECs in the future.</P>
    <P>It is rather a pity that the Bill did not address many of the wider questions that need to be addressed in vocational education. A number of very useful ideas put forward by the Minister on the future of vocational education will be discussed following the publication of the Green Paper and will be implemented in legislation following the publication of a White Paper.  I would like to compliment Members who have been involved in this debate.  We on this side of the House have taken on board the points made.  As I said earlier, we are to the forefront in putting forward the principle of partnership and we are confident that principle will be taken on board following the elections on 27 June.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to <Col N="1011" /> thank everybody who contributed to this Second Stage debate.  There were some fine individual contributions from both sides of the House.  I want to express my gratitude to Deputy Brian O'Shea for supporting the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.  As to whether the Bill should confine the teaching membership of vocational education committees to those who are members of a specific union, I gave some consideration initially to that viewpoint but, ultimately, the scope must be wide enough to include all teachers, those who are members of the Teachers' Union of Ireland, those who are not members of that union and those who are members of some other union. Due to the very responsible approach to education by the Teachers' Union of Ireland they enjoy a monopoly in this regard.  They are a union who have shown a creative dominance of vocational education in vocational schools, community colleges, DIT colleges and RTCs.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea laid heavy emphasis on the vital role of parents at every level of education.  I thank him for pointing out to the Minister before she left the Chamber last Tuesday that this is a Second Stage debate, a debate on the all important principle of parent and teacher participation in vocational education committees, and that the Bill could be amended on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey welcomed the principle of participation outlined in the Bill, particularly the participation of parents. He said that most vocational education committees consist of one or two teachers but that the teacher members tend to focus on narrow union issues rather than broader educational issues.  I disagree totally with him.  This implies a blinkered siege mentality which I totally refute. Naturally, if a union related issue or an industrial relations related issue arises the member has a valuable input in that regard.  To suggest that the members of the Teachers' Union of Ireland who are on VECs leave other educational considerations outside the door is demeaning to them, a slight on them and prejudices <Col N="1012" /> their right to sit on vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey said there was not enough time to get this legislation through the House.  I would point out to Deputy Dempsey that last Thursday the Second Stage of the University of limerick (Dissolution of Thomond College) Bill, 1991, was introduced.  That is a significant Bill in its own right involving considerable expenditure.  We finished Second Stage of that Bill by 5 p.m. last Thursday and passed Committee, Report and Final Stages at 12.30 p.m. today, having dealt with these amendments.  If the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, removes the embargo on this Bill it can be through the Dáil, the Seanad and become law within three weeks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey urged county councilors to sit down after the local elections and work out an arrangement for teacher and parent participation on VECs.  This very much conforms with the Minister's idea of writing to local authorities.  When the former Minister Gemma Hussey, wrote to local authorities, the present Minister's party dominated local authorities and got control of the VECs.  As Deputy Mac Giolla said, very few places have been given at the time of co-options to parents and teachers.  Deputy Dempsey knows that will be the case on a national scale.  Some committee, indeed a minority, will possibly appoint one or two teachers and, perhaps, even a parent or two, but Deputy Dempsey knows that the vast majority of local authorities will go the old route of rewarding the party faithful.  The Deputy concluded by assuring the House that the vocational education system is a very fine system.  We know it is a fine system, it is the finest such system.  Unfortunately, in the view of the Deputy's party, it is too fine a system to allow parents or teachers to be part of the running of the show at the highest level.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Browne of Wexford asked whether the Bill would have been introduced if Fianna Fáil did not have the majority on most VECs.  Yes, it would have been.  The principles espoused in the Bill are ones to which I have felt <Col N="1013" /> strongly committed since I became a member of a VEC.  This measure should have been introduced when the boards of management were introduced at primary school level, when we were democratising education.  That would have been a logical extension and a follow-up to the principle of management boards in vocational schools and community colleges and would have been the apex of democratisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne said that if people wanted to be part and parcel of the administration, then VECs should look to people from the real world of industry. Section 8 (4) of the 1930 Act specifies that such people should be from associations or bodies of employers.  They are the very people Deputy Browne is talking about, but how many of them have been elected on to VECs in order to garner their expertise?  Only a very few.  It is also written that such teams should include members from employees' bodies.  The Bill tries to ensure that employees' bodies, members of the Teachers Union of Ireland, will be elected by right on to VECs.  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  The 1930 legislation states that when electing people local authorities should have regard to the experience of people involved in education.</P>
    <P>As I said before, the Constitution prescribes the right of parents to be involved in education and the Bill seeks to give practical expression to that concept.  It gives statutory, compulsory effect to the spirit of the Constitution and the spirit embodied in the 1930 legislation, because when it came to the test the interests of parents were completely sidelined in the selfish rush of the unruly to gain those valuable six or nine places.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleagues Deputy Deenihan, Deputy Ahearn, Deputy Boylan, Deputy Browne and Deputy McGrath for their very strong advocacy of the Bill.  I pay particular tribute to Deputy MacGiolla and The Workers' Party, who brought their particular breadth of experience &mdash; particularly that of Deputy MacGiolla &mdash; to the debate.</P>
    <P>I share the teachers' and parents' combined disbelief and bewilderment at the <Col N="1014" /> Minister's attitude to the Bill.  How could any Minister who, a mere six weeks ago, at the annual parents' conference talked in such detail about parent power, her determination to have parents throw off the shackles of inferiority, the need for parental involvement and her Government's determination to assist in that process, then turn around and deny them places on VECs by refusing this Bill a Second Stage Reading?  That is beyond comprehension.  It is a clear indication that the Minister does not believe that parents have yet come of age, that they are mature enough to sit down side by side on VECs with the Government's political cohorts.</P>

      <P>I thank the Teachers Union of Ireland both for their support and in the past week for trying from the outset to draw public attention to the need for the Bill.  They are a most responsible, constructive and innovative union. They voted for the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> because they understood that worker participation commitments made by the Government meant worker participation for teachers as well as those in the public service. Their expectation has been well and truly shattered.</P>
      <P>I want to know why the Minister for Education does not want teachers on VECs by right.  The people, the teachers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are entitled to a full explanation for othe rejection of the Bill.  If the Bill is voted down at 8.30 this evening, then the matter must be raised at the central review committee.  Unfortunately, however, that action would be too late because if the Bill does not go through tonight, then parents and teachers cannot be on VECs between now and 1996.</P>

      <P>How could any teachers' union or any teachers' group have faith or confidence in any dealings with <Col N="1017" /> the Minister when they are pleased to accept the spirit of the Bill, giving them two places on VECs, but have been given the proverbial back of the hand by the Minister?</P>
      <P>The Minister made play about possible difficulties in drawing up the register of parents.  That would present absolutely no difficulty, either practical or legal.  The Minister knows well that the effective date of attendance at a VEC school is 30 December the previous year, and that is the way in which to find out who are the parents to be involved in the electoral process.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats have joined us, and I say to them that their constituent body is in disarray.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the Bill is flawed, inoperable and completely incompatible with the provisions of the 1930 legislation.  I counter that by saying that we &mdash; the Labour Party, Fine Gael Party and the Teachers Union of Ireland &mdash; have received expert legal opinion that shows that the legislation could be easily amended on Committee Stage by agreeing to add four people on to existing VECs, two teachers and two parents. One simple amendment could do the business overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill could be passed through the House in three weeks and there could be meaningful participation for parents and teachers <i>ad infinitum,</i> thanks to the co-operation of this side of the House.  I am very disappointed that the Minister has refused to accept the Bill.  I can only concur with the note attached to the legal advice offered to the Teachers Union of Ireland, which says: &ldquo;If, therefore, the Minister and her party vote down this Bill, then it will be because they oppose the Bill in its principle rather than for <Col N="1018" /> any technical reason.&rdquo;  In education the Minister has managed to do a very good &ldquo;Tadgh an dá thaobh&rdquo; on several occasions.  This is one issue when the &ldquo;Tadhg an dá taobh&rdquo; strategy will not wash.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 8:</P>
    <P>In page 4, subsection (1), to delete lines 14 to 20, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Subject to the provisions of this section all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade in goods and services and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the State are prohibited and void, and in particular those which&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress I had drawn attention to the fact that section 4 (1) deals with anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices.  The prohibition deals with activities in the State or in any part of the State.  That is at variance with section 5 where the equivalent prohibition dealing with abuse of a dominant position refers to &ldquo;in a substantial part of the State&rdquo;.  All these variations could, quite clearly at some stage, result in litigation.  Uniformity in both sections would be appropriate and the description in section 4 would be the better of the two.  The limitation in section 5, making the requirement to be &ldquo;in a substantial part of the State&rdquo; is not the best description because the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; is not a good word to use having regard to the fact that a good deal of argument could take place as to what exactly it meant, what part of the State it referred to, and whether territory or population might be involved in its use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 is quite distinct in its intent and purport from any of the <Col N="1022" /> other amendments.  It would insert after the word &ldquo;effect&rdquo; in line 16 &ldquo;or a decision of an association or an undertaking which has as its object or effect&rdquo;.  In this amendment I am trying to cover a possible legal loophole in section 4 as it stands.</P>
    <P>To be caught by section 4 (1), even with the amendments proposed by Deputy Barry or the Minister, would require two or more undertakings to come together to make an agreement, to devise a concerted practice or to make a decision between themselves.  In other words, we are talking about a multiplicity of organisations coming together to reach a decision.  The plurality is used throughout &mdash;&ldquo;all agreements, decisions or concerted practices between undertakings or associations&rdquo;.  However one important position could arise which would escape the net of section 4 (1) and that is a position where a single large organisation make a decision to introduce an anti-competitive measure.  An example would be the representative organisation of the vintners, motor dealers, or the oil companies, the members of which agree to comply with any directives issued by the board which could be appointed in such a way that it is not representative of each of its constituent members.  The board of that single organisation then meets and issues or adopts a resolution which would bring into force an anti-competitive measure which would otherwise be in breach of section 4 (1).  This would not be covered by section 4 (1) as that would not amount to an agreement made between undertakings or associations but rather to a decision of one organisation. Consequently, there must be a serious risk that they could escape the net which is intended to catch that kind of activity.</P>
    <P>My amendment does not seek to delete anything but rather to introduce a new element to close off that escape route for a single umbrella organisation which may decide to bring such a practice into play which could become widespread even though technically it would not arise directly from an agreement, decision or concerted practice made between undertakings or associations.  The word &ldquo;between&rdquo; is very important and clearly <Col N="1023" /> implies that two or more undertakings or associations will be involved in making an agreement.  The example I have put forward would not involve the making of an agreement but rather a governing body adopting such a policy which would not be caught by section 4 (1).  It seems that it presents a possible escape route.</P>

If they agree on something it is an agreement but if one body, group or association make a decision, assuming it is a decision made for the wrong purpose, it will be caught by the section.  The Deputy mentioned the example of the vintners' association where they all agree to charge the same price or put up the price by the same amount.  Theoretically, they do not make the decision.  Some body or representative group make the decision.  They say they are just told that that is the decision and that they do not take part in the decision making process.</P>

      <P>This point has been made also by the Law Society committee which was referred to previously.  I am not trying to make a political point but rather trying to be helpful, to make sure that we get the best possible legislation and that it contains no loopholes.  That is the object of the exercise and there is no political point scoring involved on this issue.  The Minister's amendment is closer to what I want but I am still not quite happy that it fully meets what the Minister intends to do.  Perhaps, by a very slight variation of his own amendment it could be tied up.  What worried me is that it could be interpreted to mean that it would require more than a single decision of one organisation because the plural is used.  Perhaps, if it had, &ldquo;all agreements, <Col N="1025" /> between undertakings, decisions by an association or associations of undertakings and any concerted practices&rdquo; that would copper-fasten it.  If we could, without undue inconvenience, copper-fasten the provision and get rid of any possible doubt, it would be advisable to do that.</P>

      <P>I want to return to the points the Minister made before we broke for Private Members' Business when he did not accept amendment No. 8.  I asked that the words of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome be inserted in subsection (1). Those words are, &ldquo;which may affect trade in goods and services and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the State&rdquo;.  I suggest the wording in my amendment is more appropriate. The words &ldquo;between Member States&rdquo; are used in Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome and the wording of my amendment is almost precisely the same.  It is in keeping with the spirit of what the Minister has been saying, that we want to get as close as we can to the EC legislation.  I ask the Minister to look again at my amendment which states:</P>
      <P>...which may affect trade in goods and services and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the State are prohibited and void, and in particular those which. </P>
      <P>I am making a valid point.  I do not think the Minister's amendment is as true to the spirit and letter of Article 85 as is mine.</P>
      <P>As we are discussing all the amendments together I will now refer to amendment No. 13 in my name.  The first part of my amendment states:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 33 to 48, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Competition Authority <Col N="1026" /> established by this Act (`the Authority') and the Court on an appeal from a decision of the Competition Authority...  </P>
    <P>I wish to amend it because I have a further amendment that would allow an appeal from a decision of the Competition Authority by somebody who applies for a licence and is refused.  I want to amend amendment No. 13 to comply with that. Under the Bill as it stands a person who applies for an exemption or a licence &mdash; I will come back to the words &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; or &ldquo;a licence&rdquo; later because they are not in conformity with what the EC say &mdash; has no way of appealing a decision. Whether it is the intention or a mistake, the Authority have the final say.  A person who applies for a licence and is turned down cannot appeal against that decision and must accept the Authority as the final word.  However, if one is granted a licence and somebody objects to the granting of the licence one can appeal; at least I think I am correct when I say that. In an effort to give equal treatment to both parties I have tabled this amendment.</P>
    <P>I am seeking to remove all of line 39 on page 4 which states:</P>
    <P>which in the opinion of the Authority, having regard to all relevant market conditions, </P>
    <P>I do not know why that line has been included because it is not in Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The closer we stick to the wording in the Treaty of Rome the better and for that reason I suggest we delete line 39 and the words &ldquo;market conditions&rdquo; from line 40 and that section 4 (2) should read as follows:</P>
    <P> (a)  any agreement or category of agreements between undertakings,</P>
    <P>(b)  any decision or category of decisions by associations of undertakings,</P>
    <P>(c)  any concerted practice or category of concerted practices,  </P>
    <P>The Minister keeps repeating that he <Col N="1027" /> wants to keep as close as he can to the European Community legislation but he changes small things where the reason for the change is not obvious.  It would be far better if he stuck to the wording of Article 85 which uses precisely the words I have used.  I suggest that the Minister copy this wording unless he has some good reason relating to this country why it should be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 14 is an alternative to Deputy Barry's amendment No. 13, I understand it cannot be moved but I would like to discuss it briefly.  Before I do, may I go back to the question that I raised originally on Deputy Barry's amendment No. 8 which concerns the phrase in the Bill &ldquo;in any part of the State&rdquo;.  When replying the Minister said a situation could obtain whereby somebody is guilty of an abuse of a dominant position or whatever form of anti-competitive practice in 25 out of the 26 counties but because he was not doing it in Donegal he may be able to evade being made amenable to the law.  I have some difficulty in understanding that because the section referring to anti-competitive agreements and other activities that distort competition refers clearly to &ldquo;competition in trade in any goods or services in the State&rdquo;.  I would have thought that &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; encompasses anywhere in the State where somebody is alleged to have entered into any such agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My fear, and I made the point on Second Stage, is that we are importing Articles 85 and 86 into Irish law.  They were designed for a far larger market on a European scale and what we are effectively doing is leaving the term open to the possibility that distortions of competition could happen in a market that is smaller than the national market.  I put that question to the Minister but he did not reply to it.  I asked whether that could mean in the case I instanced that a brewer in Cork could be accused of being in breach of any of the concerted practices in the context of County Cork only and not in the context of the wider markets. <Col N="1028" /> I do not understand why the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; are not sufficient.  I ask the Minister to be patient with my lack of clarity and ability to understand it and to explain it to me again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry seeks to rewrite the subsection concerned.  Section 4 (2) provides that the Authority may in accordance with section 8 grant a licence in the case of any agreement or category of agreements, any decision or category of decisions and any concerted practice or category of concerted practices which in the opinion of the Authority, having regard to all relevant market conditions, contributes to improving the production or distribution of goods or the provision of services.  I am seeking to add at that point the phrase &ldquo;serves to create a temporary environment to nurture and develop new ideas of economic endeavour and compensates State companies for social obligations which are imposed.&rdquo; There are two separate things there.  My view is that market share alone is no longer a sufficient yardstick of competitiveness. Ease of entry might be a far more reliable yardstick.  In this case we must take this legislation in isolation from the wider question of industrial policy, the impact of the Companies Bill and so on.  Any industrial legislation should have the twin objectives of trying to maintain existing employment and trying to contribute to job creation in new areas.  In so far as this strives to meet the first need, it prepares Irish companies to compete more effectively post-1992 and thereby seeks to maintain existing employment in fitter and leaner companies.  I do not believe it facilities new entrants to the marketplace.  It is basically concerned with competitiveness as between existing companies rather than new entrants to the marketplace.  For example, in areas where we are overwhelmingly importers, a cornerstone of industrial policy has been to try to create new companies in the area of import substitution or to develop existing companies in that area, thus creating new jobs.  If we try to build such new companies, there ought to be a temporary period in which they would be exempt and would have a temporary <Col N="1029" /> environment to nurture and develop new areas of economic endeavour.  Otherwise I do not see it as being practical.  Unless there is some protection given to a company which attempts to develop and take on import substitution.  I do not believe the company will make the effort.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to the phrase &ldquo;compensates State companies for social obligations which are imposed.&rdquo;  Many State companies have social obligations imposed on them.  Whatever one's political or ideological point of view, this happens to be a fact in respect of such enterprises as An Post, Iarnród Éireann, the bus companies and Telecom Éireann. There is a social obligation to deliver letters in the hills of Kerry and the wilds of Mayo just as in the populous urban areas.  We have to accept that.  I can presume that it could be a profitable business to run a bus on choice routes in Dublin but whether a private operator would want to run a bus from Ballina to Belmullet I greatly doubt.  I have similar doubts about whether ATT would want to provide and service a telephone half way up Errigal, which is an obligation imposed on Telecom Éireann.  If we are talking about levelling the playing pitch we must have regard to this question and take into account the element of social obligation. I do not believe that the State companies can discharge that social obligation without being afforded the opportunity of cross-subsidisation.  That means they make profits where they can and lose in other areas.  Taking on board old age pensioners with a free pass is not something a private operator would do.  If we are to have a level playing pitch that point must be taken into account.  If PAMBO are to be invited in by the Minister's colleague, the same obligations must be imposed on them otherwise there will not be fair competition and the purpose and thrust of this Bill will be distorted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with much of what Deputy Rabbitte has said.  I refer first to section 4 (2) which provides that the Authority may in accordance with section 8 grant a licence.  The word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; is used throughout the Bill, <Col N="1030" /> whereas the explanatory memorandum uses the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo;, as does the Treaty of Rome.  The Minister gave an explanation earlier for the use of the words &ldquo;additional&rdquo; and &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo;. The explanation was that the word &ldquo;additional&rdquo; was more in tune with case law.  In this case I would think that &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; is the more correct term.  We are exempting a category of trade from the provisions of this Bill.  The competition authority should make an exemption rather than grant a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>They should be exempted from applying for a licence.  The Minister said he would conform as much as possible with the Treaty of Rome, in which the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; is used.</P>
      <P>While I am not unsympathetic to the purport of what Deputy Rabbitte is saying, it is not practical to grow a company behind protective walls and then launch it into the EC to compete.  It will have to dive into the water at first hand. The companies to which Deputy Rabbitte is referring are already subject to the rules of competition of the EC because they are probably exporting. This Bill will apply to quite a number of companies.  Anybody who is importing is doing so from companies which are subject to EC law.  Anybody who is exporting is subject to EC law.  We are talking about a fairly narrow range of companies and undertakings which are internal to the State and not trading outside it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine, but I do not <Col N="1031" /> think rebuilding protection walls around industry is the answer.  We need to build strong competitive industries with all the difficulties there are.  If they have to be helped they can be helped in another way but not by protection.  We have suffered too much from that in the past and we should not go down that road again.</P>
      <P>In regard to compensating State companies for social obligations which are imposed, what has been going on for the past 50 or 60 years since State companies started to be formed is that the Government have been placing social obligations on State companies and not identifying them as properly the bill of the Government and not of the companies.  We have been seriously demoralising State companies here for 50 years by asking them to take on these social obligations and then complaining when they turn in losses at the end of their financial year.  What should happen in the example given by Deputy Rabbitte of the bus from Belmullet to Westport is that that run should be put up for tender and Bus Éireann and private enterprises should be asked to quote what subsidy they want for the run and the enterprise offering the most competitive price would then get the route.  I do not think it is right that Bus Éireann should be told to run a bus between Belmullet and Westport when they are paid by way of a block grant and castigated publicly for not running an efficient company.  Such procedure is extremely unfair to State companies.  If there are social obligations it is the responsibility of the Government to pick up the tab for them as they do in the case of free travel.  CIE do not, out of the goodness of their hearts, take people free on trains and buses.  There is a negotiated figure in that respect every year between the State carriers and the Government. That should be done in all State companies. The Government should recognise their social obligations and pay for them directly out of taxation and not ask State companies to carry them internally in their balance sheet.  That is the difference between where Deputy Rabbitte stands and where I stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had dealt with up to amendment No. 11 before Private Members' Business began.  I do not know whether people want me to go back over what I said.  There were some references to some of the earlier amendments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked about the phrase &ldquo;any part of the State.&rdquo;  He contrasted the difference between sections 4 and 5 where section 5 refers to a substantial part of the State.  Of course they are referring to two different things. Section 5 reflects the wording in Article 86 and deals with the abuse of a dominant position.  If the dominant position exists in the State as a whole, that is fair enough; but if the dominant position were only to exist in a small part of the State, I do not think it would be reasonable, nor did Article 86 envisage it as being reasonable, if it was not a substantial part of the Common Market.  Therefore I think it should be referred to as a substantial part of the State.  If, for example, someone has a dominant position in half a county or something of that kind, I do not think that would be enough.  That is why the reference in section 5 is to a substantial part.</P>
      <P>So far as the reference to the State or any part of the State in section 4 is concerned, and which is included in amendment No. 9, this phrase has apparently been criticised by the CII because they claim that it leaves open the possibility that distortions of competition in a market smaller than the national one would be actionable.  The CII are quite right in saying that distortions of competition in a market smaller than the national one would be actionable.  That is the intent of the words and the choice, of course, was deliberate because regional or local distortions of competition should be covered by the Bill and I do not think anyone would seriously disagree with that.</P>
      <P>We have dealt with amendment No. 10 already on the question of decisions of undertakings.  It is not necessary to go over that again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were three objections to the proposals that are contained in amendment No. 13 which is in Deputy Barry's name. <Col N="1033" /> First, it is the intention that the Authority and only the Authority will grant exemptions by way of licence.  The court would be involved as an appeal forum only from the grant of a licence and not from the refusal to grant a licence and, therefore, will not itself be in a position to grant licences.  The reason for that is that it is thought, not just as a matter of commercial policy but also as a matter of judicial policy or of jurisprudence, that it is appropriate that the granting of these licences should obviously be open to review by a court but should actually take place on the part of the Authority rather than on the part of the court.  There was lengthy discussion with the Attorney General on that point and it has been thought appropriate, after much consideration, to have it that way and it is probably reasonable.  It is not a straightforward thing but it is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry raised objections to the use of the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; but that word or term is being used to underline the administrative as distinct from the judicial character of the Authority's decisions and it was necessary to underline that for legal and constitutional reasons.  The more sensible word, in my view, would have been &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; and I think the Attorney General would have agreed with that.  However, it was thought necessary and appropriate to underline the administrative as opposed to the judicial nature of the Authority's function and that is why the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; is used.</P>
    <P>Finally the deletion of the words &ldquo;which in the opinion of the Authority having regard to all relevant market conditions&rdquo; deprives the subsection of the context in which the Authority would be making these decisions and while those words do not appear in the Treaty there are supplementary provisions to Article 85, in particular regulation 1762, which deal with decision making powers of the Commission.  Here I am talking about the European Commission.  The additional words here are necessary for sense to be made of the subsection.</P>
    <P>There is a further amendment, No. 15, in my name which is intended to correct <Col N="1034" /> a printing error.  The word &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; appears in the singular where it should have been in the plural.  In order to follow as closely as possible the meaning of section 3 of Article 85 a semi-colon has been substituted of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; between the sub paragraphs (a) and (b).</P>

      <P>The remaining amendment in this group is amendment No. 14. It seems to attempt to introduce a basis for exemption from the prohibitions which is clearly not contained in Article 85.  It seemed to be a thinly disguised form of protectionism for certain companies. That is not acceptable.  I agree with Deputy Barry that if you are trying to assist companies to grow, putting protectionist walls around them, whether tariffs or non-tariff barriers, is really no good.  There are other ways one can encourage companies, but I do not think one can use exemptions from the laws of competition.  It will be no good to them in the long term and the proof is the large number of corpses littered around the <Col N="1035" /> field of Irish industry of those who thrived while they were behind protective barriers but found it very difficult to live in the open world.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to Article 85.3 and changed the wording in section 4 (2) (a), (b) and (c) of the Bill for a reason that is not apparent to me. I ask him to comment on his response to my amendment No. 13 and the fact that I have said the people who are refused an exemption should have the right to appeal to the court.  The Minister said the Authority were a quasi-judicial body and in that case I thought it appropriate that there be an appeal against a refusal.  It is difficult to understand why a third party can appeal to a higher court against the granting of a licence by this quasi-judicial body yet some body who is refused a licence cannot appeal that decision to a superior court.  There is no apparent even-handedness in dealing with the two types of application.  I hope the Minister can reconsider because given the nature of this authority and no matter how qualified the people appointed are, there will be suspicion that they were the Minister's friends and were appointed to the authority for political reasons.  It is important then that it be obvious that there is an appeal against that decision so that everything is seen to be above board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine the number of times there will be a refusal for a licence granting or exemption granting &mdash; I prefer that word and I am not wholly convinced by the Minister's explanation for that, especially if he prefers that word himself &mdash; will be extremely limited.  If the Authority are to work properly they will be explaining to people precisely why they are refused and in very rare cases that explanation will not be accepted and will be disputed. Where it is disputed there should be a public open articulation by a superior <Col N="1036" /> court of the reasons that licence or exemption is not being granted.  People must feel they have had a fair deal in matters as sensitive as this when they have spent their lives building up a business and feel it can continue only if they are exempted from the provisions of this Bill.  It should be quite obvious to impartial observers and disinterested persons that the granting of a licence would not be warranted in that case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Barry on the question of the appeal.  I find it somewhat difficult to see the reason for the distinction drawn between the granting of the licence and the refusal of the licence.  I take the Minister's point that it was considered at great length by the Attorney General, in consultation and so on, but be that as it may, at the end of the day, it is a judicial or quasi-judicial function that the Authority are exercising here and much could depend on it.  The employment of many people could depend on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see on what basis a distinction is drawn when a judicial or quasi-judicial body give a decision to provide that if the decision goes one way it is appealable but if it goes the other way it is not.  I am trying to think back over the various quasi-judicial bodies we have in the State, and they are legion, but I can think of none where a decision one way is appealable and another way is not.  Maybe there are some such cases and I cannot think of them.  The only thing that approximates to it is a criminal trial where the prosecution cannot appeal against the acquittal.  Numbers of people complain about that.  Apart from that, the rules of basic fairness require that if the grant can be appealed, so the refusal can be appealed.  Why not, if it is basic to what we are talking about, because in the occasional case, the Authority can get it wrong?  If they can occasionally get it wrong in granting the licence they can get it wrong in refusing it too, and an appeal is always a sort of overall safety valve that is there for the occasional case that goes wrong.  Why vest the very substantial power in the Authority and say <Col N="1037" /> they are to be the final court of appeal, even though they have only heard the matter at first instance, as it were, and very substantial consequences may flow from a mistaken view cannot be dealt with on appeal?  I do not necessarily agree with Deputy Barry that because the reasons are given very few appeals would be taken.  I would not say that follows because reasons are given in every High Court decision and quite a number of them are appealed to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Very often the High Court has been overruled by the Supreme Court and the Circuit Court is overruled by the High Court.  What is so special about this Authority that they are being told that when they refuse an application for a licence in no case would they ever have got it wrong?  They may get it wrong on the odd occasion &mdash; it is almost axiomatic that they must get it wrong on the odd occasion.  Every other court in the land does.  Might it not, therefore, even in an occasional case, constitute a very serious injustice on the firm or company who were applying for the licence?  It seems a bit unfair and unusual and it is somewhat hard to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to deal with that point again.  We could debate these points all night.  On the face of it, the system is unusual and I queried why it was that way.  At first sight, I did not see why it should be that way.  The system has been examined at great length, not just over a week or two or a month or two but over the past year or more.  I can assure the House that the decision to do it this way was not taken lightly.  It is only at a superficial level that it seems strange; when you analyse it, it is not.  I want to explain it in the following way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant of a licence is the grant of an exemption from observance of the law.  To grant someone the right not to observe the law is a serious matter.  If you grant a licence you affect far more people than just the two or three parties to the amendment who are seeking the exemption. You also affect all their competitors who may be put at a severe disadvantage competitively and will thereby be <Col N="1038" /> deprived of what would otherwise be their right to damages, to prevent the parties concerned breaching the law. Therefore, you affect a whole range of people.  If the Authority decide not to grant an exemption they do not thereby allow the law to be circumvented or nonapplicable. It says that the parties concerned and all the other parties are, therefore, subject to the law, no one is at a disadvantage and the fact that you are not able to appeal that decision does not put you in a worse position than you are in as an ordinary citizen subject to the law.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong distinction between the two.  This is why it is appropriate that one of them should be appealable while the other should not.  In a sense there is nothing to appeal in regard to the other one.  If there is a refusal you are back where you started but if you are granted a licence you are in a terrifically advantageous position not just with the people who are part of the anti-competitive agreement which has been approved of but as against all your competitors. It is only right that they should have the right to appeal.  A person who applies for an exemption and is refused has, in practice, the right of appeal through the current practice of applying for a judicial review.  However, it is not as broad because the principles will not arise there.  They would only arise if there was a flagrant disregard of the procedures or something of that kind.  It is not appropriate that courts should grant an exemption from the law on grounds of public, economic or commercial policy.  If there is going to be an exemption from the law it should be by the Authority.  I have described the Authority as quasi-judicial in that sense but they will also be administrative. I am at some pains to lay emphasis in the Bill on the administrative nature of the Authority and not entirely on their quasi-judicial aspects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not put forward a convincing argument in this regard.  I accept his assurance that the Attorney General has gone into this aspect very thoroughly.  One does not <Col N="1039" /> lightly turn down the opinion of the Attorney General, the senior law officer of the State.  If two undertakings, to use the word in the Bill, apply in good faith for an exemption from the terms of the Bill &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; deliberately because from the Minister's point of view it is a better word than &ldquo;licence&rdquo; in this case &mdash; presumably the Authority would take into account all the arguments in favour of giving the licence.  However, they may grant the exemption to one undertaking and not to the other.  That decision can be appealed as the Authority will have taken evidence from other people, institutions and concerns which will be affected by the granting of such an exemption.  If the Authority still decide to grant the exemption those people can take the matter to court in an effort to have the Authority's decision upended and the exemption turned down.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said, but given that all the circumstances are the same, both companies apply for the exemption in good faith and the Authority have taken evidence &mdash; the authority are comprised of human beings&mdash;it does not seem fair that the Authority can grant the exemption in one case but not in the other.  As Deputy Taylor said, even the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, which has a huge volume of case law to guide it can occasionally get it wrong.  The authority will perhaps be manned by people who are not from a legal background &mdash; we do not know who will man it &mdash; and if they refuse to exempt an undertaking from the law, the person who applied for the exemption may feel that because his case is just, his business is destroyed, his staff are out of work and he has lost money he has no other recourse but to accept the word of these people who, even though they would obviously seek advice, may have no legal background or training.  I cannot see how the distinction the Minister has drawn is valid.  I understand the legal argument he has made but it does not hold water from the point of view of the normal fairness of application of law in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response does not convince me to any greater extent than it convinced Deputy Barry. With regard to the question of the judicial review which was mentioned by the Minister, this will be of very little help in meeting this kind of situation.  I know this remedy is there but it only has a very limited application.  To succeed in an application for a judicial review one would have to be able to show that the Authority acted in bad faith, did not consider the application fairly or whatever. That would be very exceptional and would be unlikely to be used.</P>
      <P>The way the Minister puts it, as though it was giving someone a licence to break the law, is at the root of the thinking behind this idea.  I do not think it is fair to look at it that way as that is not the way it is.  It will not be a licence to break the law because the law makes provision for the exemption.  That is a right to be considered under section 4 for the licence.  It is not left there to be determined in some arbitrary way by the Authority, that if they like the look of your face they will grant you the exemption but if they do not they will refuse the exemption.  The section lays down the very criteria which the Authority will have to examine in coming to their decision as to whether they will grant the licence.  For example, they will have to have regard to the promotion of technical or economic progress, or the improvement of the production or distribution of goods.  The criteria are laid down and the Authority are obligated to look at the facts and apply those criteria to them.</P>
      <P>It must surely follow if an applicant for a licence meets those criteria he is entitled, as of right, without favour to anybody, to have those criteria applied to his position and to have the Authority adjudicate on his application in a judicial manner.  If they fail to do that, or if the applicant thinks they failed to do that, then it follows that he should be able to appeal.  It is not a licence to break the law but a licence to avail of the law as it is presented to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An analogy might be the case of a landowner who wants to develop land <Col N="1041" /> which might have some restriction attached to it and which, as the law stands, without a special planning permission he would not be entitled to develop.  I am not going into the merits or demerits of any particular application. If his application to the county council for permission to develop the land is granted that is something new that is being granted to him.  On the other hand, if he is refused are we saying he should not be entitled to appeal that decision because he is no worse off than he was in the first place, he has not lost anything so why give him the power to appeal to An Bord Pleanála?  However, such a person has the power to appeal and rightly so.  It is possible that he will lose the case but that is the luck of the draw.</P>
    <P>We are talking about vested rights to have one's position determined in accordance with the law.  The objective judicial criteria are laid down.  The Minister made the point that a refusal could not be that serious a matter for very many people. Deputy Barry knows more about the setup in these matters than I but it is conceivable that very many people could be involved.  One could be talking about two or three companies that may have thousands of employees who could be adversely affected in some circumstances. I cannot think of a specific case but it could well be if a company do not get the licence a substantial volume of employment might well be affected. If that has to be, and it is determined eventually on appeal, so be it.  To cater for the occasional case where the Authority may get it wrong &mdash; anybody can get it wrong &mdash; in interpreting and determining whether an applicant in a case meets the criteria specified in the section, I cannot for the life of me see why it should not be open to appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I was offering earlier in relation to the point Deputy Taylor made at the beginning about the Minister's reference to the fact that this was effectively a licence to break the law.  I wonder whether that is fair or accurate.  It is not like the Trade Disputes Act where immunities are conferred for an action <Col N="1042" /> that would otherwise be unlawful.  The action in this case would not be otherwise unlawful or break the law because there are a number of reasons adduced in the Bill that justify any of those agreements, or category of agreements, being entered into.  It might be no more than good commercial practice.  It might be desirable in a particular industry that there are those agreements in operation.  It may not be feasible to function otherwise.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to hear how the travel trade, for example, would react if they were refused to have the agreements in place reinforced.  We are all aware in this very small country in which we operate that it is not beyond the powers of the imagination to believe that the Authority might react quite differently to one such set of agreements than they would to another.  We all have our areas of expertise, preference, presumed knowledge and so on.  We could conceivably have the Authority being of the view that a particular agreement is justified for any of the reasons listed in this paragraph.  However, in another case they could form the opinion that it was not so justified and refuse the licence.  In that circumstance the Minister is suggesting the applicant would have no recourse.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested this morning that I was exaggerating when I said business was only becoming alerted to it now. I know all of the arguments about the 80 per cent of the traded sector who have lived with this and so on but that is not the point at issue.  For certain sectors I suggest it is cause for alarm to find that they have no recourse where they are refused.  That could have very serious implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not want to sit down without resisting the attempt by the Minister, and Deputy Barry, to dismiss my amendment No. 14 as being some kind of thinly disguised attempt at protectionism.  I do not now, and never have in the past, argued for protectionism of any kind in industrial policy or tariff walls or anything else. That is not the point.  The point is whether anything we are doing in this Bill facilitates new entrants into the marketplace. <Col N="1043" /> I was arguing that ease of entry is a far more reliable yardstick of competitiveness than some of the other yardsticks about which we have been talking. I am talking about new companies being given a temporary period when they can be nurtured without being subjected to the full brunt of competition.  That was all that was implied in my amendment.</P>
    <P>The second aspect related to the social obligations imposed on State companies. The Minister chose not to deal with that point.  Deputy Barry suggested he would do it differently and he may well be right. The fact is that as we are today it is not done in the way Deputy Barry would like to see it done and we have to deal with the situation as it exists today.</P>
    <P>Without repeating the arguments I have made it perfectly fair to say that if people are arguing for a level playing pitch then State companies ought to be given the benefit of such a level playing pitch.  Was it PACtell who wanted to buy Cablelink from RTE?  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that if PACtell came in and were successful in competition with Telecom Éireann they would not want to hook in to the national cable system of Telecom Éireann?  There is no way that any new company coming in here would set up their own cable network. The level playing pitch argument works both ways and regard must be had to the circumstances in which State companies find themselves.  It may well be that Deputy Barry's way is the sensible way for us to tackle this question in the future, but until such time as we do then the point I have made must be answered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out to the Minister that exemptions under Article 85.3 of the EC competition policy in the Single Market lists the exemptions they see.  First, the agreement must contribute to the improvement in production or distribution or economic progress; in other words, there must be clear objective advantages involved such as the reduction of costs or an increase in the production capacity.  Second, a fair share of the resulting benefits must be allowed <Col N="1044" /> to consumers and this includes not only ultimate consumers but also trade purchasers, for example, in the form of lower price or an improvement in the quality of the goods and services concerned.  Only restrictions of competition which are indispensable in order to achieve beneficial results will be allowed.</P>
      <P>They are criteria that will have to be taken into account by the new Competition Authority.  There could be legitimate argument whether those criteria were applied objectively in particular cases.  It is a mistake not to allow this right of appeal to a higher court against the decision to refuse an exemption.  It is not as if it would be a frivolous appeal because there is nothing frivolous about spending three days in the High Court, with all the legal back-up that is required. It is an extremely serious and expensive business and would not be undertaken lightly.  The Minister should amend this section to allow that appeal to take place. In the interests of fairness it is necessary for an even-handed approach or, as Deputy Rabbitte said, a level pitch approach in this matter.  This consequential amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f)  create, directly or indirectly, artificial barriers to entry to an industrial or commercial sector, including the use of excessive brand advertising.&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 4 and the various matters that are prohibited under that section.  I am seeking to insert a new paragraph (f) which reads: &ldquo;create, directly or indirectly, artificial barriers to entry to an industrial or commercial sector, including the use of excessive brand advertising.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My argument relates to the measure of competitiveness we use.  Anything that puts artificial barriers in the way of new entrants to the marketplace is not in the best interests of this economy.  Artificial barriers, could comprise a number of different matters &mdash; in section 4 the Minister lists a number of matters.  If somebody has a monopoly of raw material, technical expertise or whatever, they too constitute barriers to entry.  Specifically I would argue that the use of excessive brand advertising is tantamount to a barrier to entry, especially in low technological threshold companies where advertising is used to such a level of soak-age that one simply could not compete <Col N="1046" /> as a new entrant.  The building societies could be given as an example.</P>
    <P>We are bombarded with so much advertising every night from the main building societies that one would get the impression they are offering a different service or that the service they offer varies in a substantial way.  It does not vary in any significant way, but the inordinate level of very expensive advertising would certainly cow any new entrant to the marketplace.  He simply would not be able to compete.  What is the purpose of this?  Not only is there monopoly in some cases but there is oligarchy in the case of the building societies.</P>
    <P>The big soft drinks companies use a similar tactic in the United States and across the world.  The distribution curve of Coca Cola and Pepsi, to all intents and purposes, is equivalent to the distribution curve of the industry but the impression is created of a fantastic competitive environment.</P>
    <P>This amendment which seeks to include an additional practice that ought to be prohibited should be taken on board by the Minister.  Any artificial barriers to entry of new companies ought not be facilitated.  That is the acid test of competitiveness. It is all very well to say you have a share of the marketplace, but the real test in terms of competitiveness is whether some new body can enter and survive.  This is a matter that needs to be addressed.  I could instance the case of tobacco companies where there is a similar low technology threshold but again by sheer level of advertising the circumstances are created where competition is virtually snuffed out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is dealing with a subject very close to my heart.  I have no problem in empathising with the points he is putting forward but I am not sure if what he says is very practical.  It is part of the industrial policy of the Government and the IDA that we should build brand leaders that would be strong enough to take over a significant share of the market abroad and create high quality <Col N="1047" /> brands in the European market and throughout the world.  I gather from something Deputy Rabbitte said earlier that he would subscribe to that strategy for increasing employment here.  If we feel we should do that, using Ireland as a base to launch into Europe, it would be difficult to stop foreign companies from doing the same.  Unfortunately in the commercial world in which we live, part of the investment must be made establishing the companies and not just in bricks and mortar, personnel and knowhow. There must also be a large marketing budget if one is to make any impression on the market.  That may not be very desirable.  Deputy Rabbitte might think it is not one of the strict criteria that should be applied for commercial success.  It may be that the element of goodwill has no tangible worth and that it should be knocked off the balance sheet.</P>
      <P>In all, there are good arguments to be made in favour of all those views, and many smaller business people would certainly throw their caps in the air with delight if such a thing could be brought about.  However, I am not sure it is practical in the world we live in.  Much as I would dearly like to support the amendment for those reasons &mdash; and I certainly accept the spirit of it &mdash; I am afraid the practicality of what is suggested is not on at the moment, even though it does relate to a very serious problem that has to be faced in the future, particularly in the food sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to build strong brand names, then it is essential but it is not enough to have high quality foods, it is essential but it is not enough to have good packaging, it is essential but it is not enough to have good marketing, and it is also essential to provide significant sums of money for advertising in order to break into the markets of Britain, Germany and France. Slow progress will be made on the first three elements, but if big companies are to be created here then I am afraid they will have to be backed by big advertising <Col N="1048" /> budgets.  The Government, industry and particular firms and sectors will have to face up to that fact if we are to make our mark in Europe.</P>
    <P>The growth of these firms is the way to get employment but the cost is huge, and that has to be faced up to.  One will not dent the markets in any of the four big countries in Europe &mdash; France, Britain, Germany and Italy &mdash; by spending less than £5 million sterling on advertising and that sum is well beyond the capabilities of most companies other than the multinationals. If the Government are serious about strong brand names &mdash; and they are right to encourage amalgamation to strengthen firms, to produce quality brands and to put the emphasis on quality, marketing and packaging &mdash; something more is needed.</P>
    <P>I am speaking of food because that is the area I know best.  The supermarket chains that dominate the retail trade, not as much in other countries as they do here, will accept quality products.  They have very strict quality guidelines, they inspect the premises where the goods are produced, they will want to have a say in the design of the labelling and packaging of a product, they will want to know about the market strategy of a company and how much has been invested, they will ask the producer what is being done to assist them in the sale of a product on their shelves and they will want to know the producer's advertising budget for a product in a certain area.  I am digressing a little from Deputy Rabbitte's amendment, but we must wake up to that reality or we will still have more than 250,000 people unemployed.  Besides goods, packaging and marketing we also have to make an investment in advertising.  That is regrettable but it is a fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment adds a specific example of what might be an anti-competitive practice to those already contained in Article 85.  That is an undesirable departure in itself for the following reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> The general rules of Article 85 are sufficient as competition rules at Community level.  I believe they should be sufficient for this State.  It would be possible to provide a long list of what different people consider to be anti-competitive practices, but I believe it better to stay with normal concepts, particularly when there are 34 years of judicial enforcement and decision making behind the existing concept.  I do not disagree with what Deputy Rabbitte said in regard to advertising and the crushing, pointless, idiotic advertising of major brands that goes on all the time, purely to force out competitors or prevent others from arriving on the scene.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of specific rules not contained in the Treaty could give rise &mdash; I believe would give rise &mdash; to our courts giving undue weight to some practice over others.  It might serve to limit the discretion and the general nature of the prohibitions.  The amendment suffers from the problem that lies in the existing restrictive practice orders in as much as it addresses a particular problem that may become irrelevant over time.  What is contained in article 85 of the Treaty has stood the test of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte is anxious that people have freedom of entry to the market.  He instanced the heavy, excessive advertising &mdash; brand advertising &mdash; as a way of keeping out competitors.  However, if section 4 (1) in its entirety could be properly applied in this country for the first time, then that would provide the greatest guarantee of entry for our people who were competent.  It has worked in the European Community and it can and will work here.  I do not want to go beyond that, not because I disagree with what Deputy Rabbitte says but because I want to try to apply the basic principles of the Treaty as much as they can be applied, within reason and given the differing circumstances.  If additional criteria are added, particularly to something like this, then all kinds of significance would be read into the additions as <Col N="1050" /> against existing criteria.  If the criteria are opened up, when do we stop?  Other practices are equally objectionable to those mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte, and they cannot all be included.  That would be to go back to the old days of the 1972 legislation and earlier enactments which were unsatisfactory.  We would be back to the days of making restrictive practice orders rather than expressing general principles.</P>

      <P>I am becoming increasingly irritated as the debate goes on because of the apparent slavish devotion that is being developed towards Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.  If we were so dedicated and so devoted to the Treaty then surely we would have complied with it long before now?  If the Treaty were gospel to such an extent, then why have we waited so long before bringing in a Bill to deal with it?  Of course the Treaty is the guideline, but we do not have to follow every comma, every semicolon, and every dot in exactly the same way. The fact that a particular wording worked well for the whole Community does not necessarily mean that an improvement could not be made in its general application in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the point being made that the generality of the prohibition would be affected.  The layout of the wording of section 4 introduces a generality and then rightly goes on to say that without prejudice of the generality of the facts of the position stated above the following more specific items would contravene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a sense Deputy Rabbitte's amendment is in two parts.  First, if the final phrase, &ldquo;including the use of excessive brand advertising&rdquo; is left out and one deals with the amendment up to and including the word &ldquo;sector&rdquo;, I think that is probably included in the general prohibition set out in the beginning of section 4(1).  The only part that brings in a new, more specific element is the excessive use of brand advertising.  In his reply the <Col N="1051" /> Minister conceded that that is a valid point and that it has an anti-competitive effect.  If that is so, I do not understand why one should follow Article 85 slavishly, because that particular factor, which happens to be a very serious one in this country, perhaps is not so serious in other countries like France or Germany. It certainly is here.  The Minister concedes that.  Why not include it?  We are not talking about opening up the thing to a whole multitude of additional specifics. There is only one before us.  If it has a role to play and if it would be helpful to the position of this country it would be fair enough to include it.</P>

I reproduced the wording of Article 85 in my amendment.  Why did the Minister find it necessary to change the wording in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) since we have been slavishly following Article 85 all evening.  That is the right approach because competition law is based on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank you for allowing me to raise this serious matter on the Adjournment, which has caused so much anxiety, apprehension and concern not alone in the Ballintra area, where the incident occurred, but throughout south Donegal.</P>
      <P>The series of events commenced last Saturday night at about 11 p.m. when a gang of armed men took over the home of the family involved and held the five occupants of the house, including a seven months old baby, hostage until about 10 a.m. on Monday morning, a period of almost 36 hours.  During that time a truck belonging to the family was commandeered and subsequently driven across the Border, ten or 15 miles away. Ballintra is ten or 15 miles from the Border, depending on which route you take.  The truck was loaded with explosives and mortars and was parked outside a security installation near St. Angelos's Airport, Enniskillen.  Fortunately, most of the explosives failed to detonate and, miraculously there were no injuries or loss of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of most serious and, indeed, critical dimensions to this incident.  First, it indicates a sinister and disturbing development in the campaign of violence being waged in Northern Ireland and shows that there is no hesitation in using our territory to plan, initiate and launch a murderous raid on our neighbours just across the Border. Second, it is absolutely reprehensible that an innocent family could be subjected to the distressing and terrifying ordeal of being held hostage in their own house for almost two days not knowing what was to be the final outcome of their captivity. Third, such an incident heightens tension in an area where there has been perfect co-operation and harmony in the community. There is a mixed religious community in Ballintra and its surrounding area and there is an excellent relationship <Col N="1057" /> between both communities going back generations.  It is a pity that this incident has been inflicted on this area.</P>
    <P>This incident cannot be taken in isolation. Just over two years ago about 200 to 300 yards down the road, almost in the same townland, another event took place that ended in tragedy.  On a Sunday evening a young man from Northern Ireland while visiting his girl friend was short dead in his car outside her house.  The entire area was shocked and dismayed at this brutal cold blooded murder but in spite of the best efforts of the Garda Síochána I do not recall anyone ever being charged with this gruesome deed.  It is only a fortnight since I had the sad duty to attend the removal of the remains of another victim of this violence, that of a Donegal county councillor.  These events show that violence does not recognise any border.  We all fervently hope and pray that peace and harmony will be achieved in Northern Ireland.  In the meantime, we do not want County Donegal to become a tit for tat territory or a battleground to settle scores.</P>
    <P>Since this incident in Ballintra came to light on Monday morning intensive Garda inquiries are under way.  I request the Minister of State to ensure that every support is available to the Garda and any extra resources requested or needed should be granted immediately.  Every effort must be made to ease the anxiety and tension caused by these incidents and the Minister of State should give a public assurance that the entire authority of his Department and the Government will be used to prevent a recurrence of these deeds.  Perhaps the Minister of State could also let the House know what progress, if any, has been achieved since Monday in apprehending those responsible for holding this family hostage for almost two days.</P>
    <P>On a somewhat more humane note, the hostage family in Ballintra are now without the means to earn their livelihood. Their lorry on which they depended was blown up.  Perhaps the <Col N="1058" /> Minister would give the matter of adequate compensation his immediate attention.  Their ordeal was terrifying enough without the extra worry and concern of a significant financial loss.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, these events are the source of widespread concern throughout County Donegal and the people want an assurance that the Garda will be offered every assistance, and that everything possible will be done to ensure that there is co-operation on both sides of the Border to prevent a recurrence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to express our outrage at the events which occurred over the weekend in Ballintra, County Donegal; and subsequently in County Fermanagh.  Those events demonstrate again the complete disregard which the subversives show for the rights and lives of people on both sides of the Border.  Nothing is allowed to stand in the way of the murderous campaign being waged by them, whether the right of a family in Donegal to the quiet enjoyment of their home or the risk created for the people of Fermanagh by the deployment of a lorry armed with mortars and explosives.  We can be grateful only that the attack, which appears to have been directed at the Mount Angelo army base near Enniskillen was unsuccessful and that there was no loss of life as the base.</P>
      <P>I would hope that the House will join me in condemning these actions and those responsible for perpetrating them. I would also hope that our response to those events will be to renew our resolve to ensure that the subversives do not succeed in their murderous campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the events in Ballintra, we are informed by the Garda authorities that at 11 p.m. on Saturday, 1 June armed men broke into a home in Ballintra, County Donegal and held the five occupants, who included as Deputy McGinley said a baby of seven months, hostage until 10 a.m. on Monday 3 June.  During <Col N="1059" /> that period, a lorry belonging to the owner of the house was stolen.  That lorry was subsequently used in what appears to have been an attempted attack at Mount Angelo army base near Enniskillen at 10 a.m. on Monday 3 June.  The Garda believe members of the Provisional IRA to have been responsible for both incidents.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that the incident is being actively investigated by the Garda, with all the resources at their disposal with the full support of my Department and assurance of the Government.  As that investigation is continuing I do not wish to elaborate beyond what I have said on the detail of the incident itself or the nature of the investigation being conducted at this time.</P>
    <P>I also wish to assure the House that additional measures are being taken by the Garda in the Donegal area.  It would be self-defeating to reveal details of those measures to the House and Deputies will, I hope, understrand why I would prefer not to elaborate on them.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by appealing to anybody who may have noticed anything suspicious in or around Ballintra over the weekend or who possesses any information about the incident which may be of assistance to contact any member of the Garda.  Likewise, I would appeal to members of the public to report anything of a suspicious nature which may come to their attention in the future. It is only with the active assistance of the public that we can hope to defeat these subversive groups.</P>

    <Title>Weekend Disturbances in County Wicklow.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me this opportunity to raise this matter so soon after the occurrence.  According to Garda estimates, on any fine holiday weekend we can expect as many as 30,000 people, <Col N="1060" /> day trippers or tourists, to visit County Wicklow.  The vast majority are very welcome and always will be, but last weekend, which turned out to be a fine weekend and Brittas Bay was packed, some very unwelcome guests arrived.  A number of young men and women who were obviously the worse for drink arrived in the area and a fracas took place in a restaurant and licensed premises where furniture was wrecked.  The fight continued on the main road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Visitors, young boys and girls and their parents, were frightened by the viciousness of these attacks which took place. Squad cars from Wicklow, Arklow and Gorey were summoned and upwards of a dozen gardaí were required to restore peace and sense.  An ambulance had to be called because a number of people involved sustained injuries.  In addition, a great deal of damage was done.  Many people will visit Wicklow over the summer, particularly on fine weekends, and already we have incidents such as this but not to the same severity in Glendalough and Laragh.  Unpleasant incidents have occurred in the Lough Dan area at the Glenmacnass Waterfall and in Rathnew where a woman and her daughter were threatened by people carrying knives and a bayonet type instrument. In Wicklow town a jewellery shop was totally cleaned out and vandalised in broad daylight.  We believe this is the result of great activity by the Garda Síochána in Dublin in that some of these people find the pickings much easier in the towns surrounding the metropolis and outside the Garda Síochána metropolitan area.  While we are delighted to hear of the improvement in the Dublin area, some of the vandalism and mayhem is being transferred to Wicklow.  It is well known that a great many of the visitors are unaware of the problems that can result from these people, some of whom arrive on motorbikes and some of whom are backpackers.  Indeed I believe that at the weekend two taxi loads came down from south County Dublin.  I can assure Members that it was from that area <Col N="1061" /> because the Garda informed me they were from the Shankhill-Ballybrack area.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that special security arrangements are made for the very scenic areas of County Wicklow particularly Glendalough where up to 250,000 people visit in any one year, and indeed, around Lough Dan and the Glenmacnass area.  A large number of visitors are attracted to the towns of Rathnew and Wicklow because of the facilities available.  If we are to develop a tourism industry in a county like Wicklow we need the protection of the law to ensure that people can park their cars safely and walk the streets safely.  We have not got a sufficient number of gardaí because the strength of the force is based on the population in the winter, which is about 95,000 but this increases to anything up to 150,000 at times during the summer months.  The number of gardaí is sadly lacking and there are insufficient patrol cars.  The Garda overtime is restricted and limits the number of gardaí available, particularly at weekends.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity &mdash; although I regret to have to use an occasion such as this in this way &mdash; to highlight the crime that is increasing in its intensity and that we expect will occur again and again if action is not taken to bring better Garda support to the Wicklow area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion may I point out that the Barnderg Garda station which covered the Brittas Bay area was closed down a few years ago.  There is no Garda station in Glendalough and only one patrol car is available at any time in the Wicklow area and it covers an area of about 23 to 25 miles.  If the patrol car is in the Roundwood area and is needed in Brittas Bay, it can take quite a long time to get there.  Thankfully, the Garda were available and were very quick to respond to the call from Brittas Bay.  Action was taken and I am glad that there were no injuries or loss of life.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the summer season, however, I take this opportunity <Col N="1062" /> to ask the Minister to look at the need for additional policing in the Wicklow area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, let me say that I fully share the Deputy's concern at the appalling incidents of vandalism which occurred in Wicklow during the holiday weekend.  I am of course very concerned that people in Wicklow have been the victims of this type of crime.  I would like to assure them that the Garda authorities are determined to get to the root of this problem and are taking all appropriate action to ensure that the perpetrators of these acts will be located and brought to justice as quickly as possible. This behaviour is not, and never will be, accepted in a civilised society, and those who attempt to flout the law and interfere with the peaceful enjoyment of an occasion, such as a holiday weekend, can expect to be brought to face the full rigour of the law.</P>
      <P>The amenities at Brittas Bay attract a large number of visitors, I understand that this can be as high as 3,000 people on a peak day during the summer months and at weekends.  It is understandable, therefore, that an area like Brittas Bay, which has such a high volume of through traffic, is quite likely to attract a certain criminal element.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that this matter is now the subject of a full and thorough Garda investigation, and I could not divulge details of that investigation because to do so could of course simply reveal the Garda hand to the criminals who have committed these crimes.</P>
      <P>I can say that the Garda have taken swift and determined action in this case and are following definite lines of inquiry. Deputy Kavanagh has acknowledged the fact that the Garda were on the scene very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that this problem is attributed to the activities of young people.  Parents have a special role to play in the prevention of <Col N="1063" /> such incidents by instilling in their children a greater respect for property and by exercising greater supervision over them. Institutions such as schools, youth organisations and residents' associations, must also play their part in helping our young people to become responsible adults.  I believe that with a greater intensification of effort all round a big impact can be made in reducing the incidents of vandalism and general delinquency and in influencing persons and, in particular, our youth, to turn away from criminal tendencies.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the Garda authorities have informed me, that they are taking all appropriate action, including the use of intensive patrolling, both by mobile and other specialist units, to prevent a recurrence of this problem.  I would ask the local community to assist the gardaí in any way possible, by being vigilant and by reporting any suspicious happenings to the Garda immediately.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the Garda are giving special attention to the areas in question with a view to curbing the problem.  The crime situation continues to be of great concern and we are determined to ensure that all further feasible measures that are needed to tackle it successfully are taken and that the necessary resources are made available and deployed to enable that to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh has referred to various situations.  I can assure both the Deputy and other Members that we have not closed any Garda station nor do we intend to close any station.  Recently it was my privilege to inspect the passing out parade of almost 90 new gardaí.  We are presently about to recruit another 1,000 young gardaí into the force.  We have deployed some of the recent recruits to the eastern part of the country, particularly to Dublin and the greater Dublin area, but some to parts of County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>We are proceeding with an intensive community policing programme.  Extra <Col N="1064" /> resources will be available and a new style policing, particularly with a community emphasis, will be in operation. We hope that mobilisation, particularly in mechanically propelled vehicles, will be more readily available to the gardaí involved in community policing so that they will be able to get to the scene of the crime much more quickly than heretofore. The Minister for Justice has done trojan work to ensure that the system is expanded and that the resources are made available in the interests of community protection.</P>
    <P>The Garda strategy for combating crime in the area of County Wicklow will, of course, continue to be kept under review as will the question of Garda manpower.</P>

      <P>These bank charges are colossal figures and is lost money for the provision of health services in the Southern Health Board area.  The Department of Health must bear the sole responsibility for this as they continually delay the payment of moneys to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own town of Mallow we have been seeking an additional 20 beds in the local hospital since 1989.  The sum of <Col N="1065" /> money to be paid by the board to banks, £400,000, would more than cover the cost of the additional 20 beds in Mallow Hospital.  In fact, if the money was to be used for extra beds in Mallow Hospital it would be of great benefit to the people of the area instead of further inflating the swollen coffers of rich banks.</P>
    <P>The shortfall between the allocation given by the Department of Health for the running of the Southern Health Board and what the board estimates they need is in the region of £4 million for 1991.  In fact, the sum paid to the banks in interest charges is one-tenth of the shortfall that the board will have and represents a large proportion of money in terms of health services they can pay for.</P>
    <P>Another area of expenditure I wish to highlight is the money paid by the Southern Health Board in legal fees.  In 1989 a sum of £247,000 was lost by the board in legal fees and the figure for the last year stands at £138,000.  This expenditure, like that to the banks, is money that is lost to pay for the running of the health services.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Health to make good the shortfall in funds to the Southern Health Board.  It does not make any sense for the Minister to be asking the board to prepare a development service plan or a value-for-money programme until the Department make up at least the amount lost from the board in bank interest charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sherlock for giving me an opportunity to speak. At a time when the Southern Health Board are in deep financial crisis with long waiting lists, essential equipment breaking down and so serious a cash flow problem that suppliers are not being paid on time, it is obsence that the banks will make profits of almost £500,000 between bank charges and interest on overdraft in the coming year.  I am not blaming the banks.  The Minister must take responsibility. This is only part of the problem <Col N="1066" /> nationwide.  How much money is going by way of leakage from the health funds to the financial institutions?  The problem raised tonight is only part of the picture nationally.  Evidence is surfacing day by day of major payments being made to the banks because the statutory bodies, health boards and local authorities, are not getting what they need to fund their activities.  It is time for total assessment of how much money is leaking from the services to the banks.  It is obscene and must be put right.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept his responsibility.  The £400,000 that will be lost to the Southern Health Board could be used to reduce waiting lists and provide essential services.  The poorest of the poor are being screwed to the wall. Medical card holders are being pursued for debts outstanding to health boards and, at the same time, the boards are being forced to pay moneys to the banks. The Minister must accept responsibility and make good the losses to the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat surprised at the terms of the motion and that the Deputy, as a health board member, should have brought it before the House in its current form.  Two quite separate issues have been tied together here in an arbitrary manner.  I am glad, however, to have the opportunity to reiterate the terms of the Government's commitment to maintaining the qualify and scope of our health services, while developing their efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every health agency uses overdraft as part of their day-to-day operations.  In the case of the health boards, maximum overdraft levels are set by my Department and are rigidly enforced.  The maximum overdraft is a set percentage of the approved allocation, in this instance 2.8 per cent of the approved allocation.  The board then use this overdraft facility as and when it is needed, <Col N="1067" /> in the judgment or management.  The amount of interest payable is ultimately determined by interest rate levels in the economy as a whole.  I stress that this a routine requirement in the financial functioning of each health agency and cannot be regarded as pre-empting funds available for services as between one year and another.  There is a certain irony in the fact that only a few months ago the Opposition were urging an extension of borrowing facilities available to health agencies, a move that could only increase the interest charges.</P>
    <P>Before moving to the question of the Southern Health Board's position I would like to make a few comments about the broader issue of total health service funding.  The Government's commitment to the health services is firmly underlined by the 1991 provision.  The gross non-capital provision for the health services in 1991 amounts to over £1.5 billion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the £400,000?  The Minister is coming in here to bluff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responding to the Deputies, neither of whom I interrupted while they were making their case.  I did not attempt to waste the limited time available.  I am anxious to give a full and detailed reply to the Deputies who have taken the trouble to stay in the House until 11.05 p.m.</P>
      <P>The health services share of resources has increased each year since we came into office.  This year, over one-fifth of total Government expenditure on non-capital supply services is devoted to the health services.  In addition, the Government have made available an Exchequer capital provision of £32,330 million.  A further £9 million will be made available from non-Exchequer sources, bringing the total capital provision to over £41 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Underpinning the 1991 provision for <Col N="1068" /> the health services is a firm commitment to the maintenance, subject to normal seasonal closures, of 12,000 acute hospital beds.  The Government also recognise the difficulties which certain demand-led schemes cause for the health boards.  This year, the cost of these schemes has, for the first time, been identified in a separate subhead.  If the cost of these schemes proves to be higher than anticipated, the full cost of the schemes will be funded from the Exchequer.  The health boards will, therefore, be relieved of the burden of having to make savings elsewhere in order to cover these costs.  This measure will be of significant further assistance to the health boards in the maintenance of services.</P>
    <P>The considerable level of resources invested in the health services places a special responsibility on all agencies to ensure that there is maximum return for the taxpayer on the funds invested in the health services.  To this end I have instituted a vigorous value-for-money programme in the health services.  Each health board appointed a senior official to co-operate in the national programme and to exploit the full potential of the value-for-money initiatives.  I fully expect that the VFM programmes will generate additional resources which will further assist agencies in maintaining services at the approved levels.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board will, of course, benefit from the Government commitments outlined earlier.  The board are participating in the national arrangements to promote value for money initiatives, as well as pursuing an extensive VFM programme of their own.  Management in the board are also examining the scope for delivery of services in different ways so as to maximise the number of patients treated while at the same time respecting budgetary limits.  We are working very closely with the board in monitoring these various elements as the year progresses and I am confident that <Col N="1069" /> our undertaking to maintain service levels will be delivered.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is appropriate to underline the particular attention the Government have paid to tackling the complex problems present in a modern health service.  The reports produced recently by the groups headed by Mr. David Kennedy and Mr. Noel Fox are particularly useful and we are working quickly to implement their recommendations. In recent days we have implemented the key recommendation of the Commission on Health Funding &mdash; that eligibility for free hospital services be extended to all regardless of income. This is a positive and constructive move, designed to eliminate anomalies in the system of eligibility and to promote the basic principle that services should be made available to all on the basis of medical need, not income.</P>
    <P>I trust that, despite the alarmist note the Deputy has insisted on sounding in this motion, he can agree on our need to work towards this common aim.</P>

      <P>As we know there is a major unemployment problem at the moment.  The number unemployed is rapidly approaching 250,000.  County Kerry is no different from the rest of the country. We have been very hard hit by the increase in unemployment in recent times.  In the Tralee area alone there was an increase of 960 people on the live register from April 1990 to April 1991. This represents an increase of 23 per cent. In the Listowel area the unemployment rate stands at 1,500 people.</P>
      <P>There are several social employment schemes sanctioned for County Kerry which are not getting the go-ahead from the Department of Labour.  These schemes would involve work for over 300 people and will provide much needed employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also Kerry County Council have embarked on a tidy village scheme which <Col N="1070" /> is contingent on social employment schemes.  We have invested £100,000 this year for this scheme.  However, if the schemes are not put in place, this will be in jeopardy and will have to be postponed. I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister for Labour to do everything possible to ensure that these schemes are given the go-ahead as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that in some regions there has been a backlog in some of the schemes.  However, I am pleased to inform the House that I have obtained the approval of the Government to increase the number of places on the social employment scheme by 2,500 between now and the end of the year.</P>
      <P>This will result in expenditure of about £71 million being incurred in 1991 on the social employment scheme involving an Exchequer allocation of £62 million, which represents an increase of over £11 million on the 1990 allocation, and EC assistance of over £9 million.  This is a very significant level of expenditure and is evidence of the Government's commitment to helping the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>I am committed to maintaining the SES at the highest possible level of participation as it is the principal manpower intervention to assist the long term unemployed. It provides an opportunity for persons who had been long term unemployed to become involved in a work related situation, albeit on a part time basis, for one year.  It provides the discipline of working again together with the opportunity to learn new skills or practice existing skills.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, participants must be over 25 years of age and either in receipt of unemployment assistance or registered as unemployed for over 12 months and in receipt of unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS now operate on a regional basis with each region having its own budget to cover the provision of training and <Col N="1071" /> employment schemes in the region.  This ensures a more equitable distribution of FÁS operations throughout the country resulting in some cases in requests for projects under the various schemes in parts of the country where a demand did not exist prior to regionalisation.  This could mean that despite the increase in numbers the same number of projects may not be renewed in certain areas in order to allow worthwhile projects to start in new areas.  As already stated, the level of funds available will allow around 12,500 people to be involved on SES projects by the year's end.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the number of older unemployed people with families who are now participating in the scheme in increasing numbers.  This resulted from the introduction of the child dependant allowance last year.  At present around 57 per cent of participants have adult and <Col N="1072" /> child dependants compared with only 30 per cent at the end of 1989.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that participation in the scheme is very worthwhile for participants and helps improve their prospects of obtaining employment when opportunities become available.  There is the added bonus that the projects on which the participants work are of significant benefit to local communities.  The scheme has received universally favourable comment from sponsors and participants and there has been heavy demand from potential sponsors and participants alike.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Deputy Deenihan for raising the question in a constructive way.  I will look at the areas he mentioned. As I think he knows, I will be involved in some FÁS activities in the area on Friday of this week so I will talk to the local managers about the problems the Deputy raised at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in recent budgets to improve the position of low income families dependent on social welfare payments.  This year's budget was no exception.  The main underlying philosophy is the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that the Government will move to the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare by 1993, which will involve an estimated <Col N="837" /> additional expenditure of £65 million. Thereafter there is a commitment to increase the rates further and progressively, in accordance with the recommendations of the commission, as the resources of the economy grow.</P>
      <P>The Government are also committed to further streamline the rates or payment as the opportunity arises.  Deputies will recall that the rates structure has been simplified over the last number of years.  For example, the number of child dependant allowance rates has been reduced from 36 in 1987 to three rates this year.  Other areas have also been streamlined where it was considered that the existing structure/differentials were not warranted.  In continuing this approach in the 1991 budget certain payments will not be increased by a full 4 per cent in July, while others, on the other hand, will be increased by over 11 per cent.  I would like to assure the House that all the increases are in line with the commitment in <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and, in general, represent significant real increases given that the rate of inflation is now running at 2.6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The percentage increases in the rates of payment are set out in the following <Col N="838" /> table which I will make available to Deputies.  It shows that in certain cases a less than 4 per cent increase applies from July.  However, the rationale for this, far from being a discriminatory policy, follows from the need, as well recognised by outside commentators, to streamline the payments structure wherever possible.</P>
    <P>The table also illustrates that certain payments will be increased by far more than 4 per cent for example, short term unemployment asistance and similar payments will be increased by over 11 per cent.  The minimum child dependant allowance rate has been increased by 9 per cent.  Deputies will see, in fact, that in three of the four cases where a less than 4 per cent increase applies an increase of greater than 4 per cent applies to another element of the same payment, For example, the child dependant allowance rates for old age contributory and retirement pension will be increased by over 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would urge Deputies to look at the overall rates structure and the achievements that have been made and will continue to be made under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>There are provisions within the transfer arrangements for pension entitlements within the public sector for the benefit of people who have served in the national Army.

As Minister for Social Welfare I have no statutory function in relation to the rules or the benefit formulae of such schemes.</P>
      <P>While the Pensions Act of 1990 provides for a range of very significant safeguards for private occupational pension schemes relating to such matters as the preservation of members rights, statutory funding control, disclosure of information, equal treatment for men and women and the duties and responsibilities of trustees, it does not provide for minimum levels of pension or for the reckonability of certain periods of service.

      <P>Smallholders claiming unemployment assistance are required at present to comply with the signing-on arrangements applicable to all unemployed claimants.  Such persons who reside over six miles from their nearest local office are required to attend at their local Garda station or other approved signing centre once a week to have their unemployment declarations certified by a member of the Garda Síochána.  These claimants are paid at their local post office.</P>
      <P>In recent years, I have arranged for substantial investments in new technologies with a view to improving the service to social welfare clients.  New and modern systems for the unemployed constitute a very specific objective which I have set my Department.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made for alternative methods for paying certain unemployed persons.  Some of these changes are already taking effect, for example the arrangements using personalised paying orders in book form are already proving to be a very efficient and acceptable way for paying our older clients.  This development was needed to bring in the pre-retirement allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>I have in mind extending this form of payment to smallholders generally as circumstances allow.  Planning is already at an advanced stage; detailed discussions with the various interested parties are underway and a considerable measure of agreement has already been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that a further set of substantial improvements will be in operation for unemployed recipients, including smallholders, within the next six <Col N="841" /> months and will be extended during 1992. The new arrangements will reduce the need for signing generally for many unemployed people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The family income supplement is a weekly cash payment to low paid employees with families.  The scheme provides an incentive to those on low pay to remain in employment.  When it was introduced in 1984 it was felt that the self-employed, including farmers, had less incentive to give up work and claim an unemployment payment, as they had no entitlement to unemployment benefit.  As a result, the self-employed were excluded from the scope of the scheme.</P>
      <P>At present, low income farmers can benefit from smallholders unemployment assistance.  From July of this year, for example, a married farmer with three children will be entitled to a maximum payment of £124 per week.  This represents a 34.6 per cent increase over the period 1987 to 1991.</P>
      <P>The question of extending FIS to farmers must be considered in the context of a possible extension to self-employed workers generally.  This would represent a major change in the emphasis of the scheme and would give rise to a considerable cost to the Exchequer.  Such a major decision would have to take into account other measures to aid low income farmers.  The Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, is at present considering a scheme of income aid to low income farmers, for which £1 million has been provided in his Department's 1991 Estimate.</P>
      <P>I intend to review the possible extension of FIS to self-employed persons in a budgetary context, in the light of other measures to aid the farming sector, and taking account of available resources.</P>

      <P>The office in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, dealing with social welfare claimants was a branch employment office.  Such offices are operated by private individuals under contracts with my Department.  The service contract is confined to the signing of, and making payments to, unemployed persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Managers of a branch employment office provide the necessary premises and may hire staff to assist in the carrying out of the service.  In the case of Castlecomer, <Col N="844" /> the manager has resigned and new premises will have to be provided.  This development has given an opportunity to consider the needs of all our clients in the Castlecomer area, and will better meet local requirements.</P>
    <P>Unemployed claimants who previously signed at the Castlecomer office will continue to receive their payments regularly and on time and the process will be made more convenient for them.  An important improvement being piloted in the area is a fortnightly signing arrangement.  At present claimants are required to attend at a pre-set time every week.  In future, they will be able to receive their payments weekly at their local post offices and will only be required to sign at fortnightly intervals.</P>
    <P>I am providing a new information service in the town of Castlecomer.  Premises are being acquired and will be specially adapted for this purpose.  They will be staffed by trained permanent staff.  There will also be a social welfare officer in attendance and facilities for private discussions with members of the public.  The office will have a computer link to the main social welfare computer system allowing for immediate responses to queries on individual entitlements.  The question of providing facilities for the speedier processing of disability benefit claims is also under consideration.</P>
    <P>Pending the completion of the work on the new office, I have arranged for a temporary renting of the premises in which the former branch office was located.  It will be staffed by my officials who will provide whatever assistance is needed for a smooth transition to the new and expanded service.</P>
    <P>I am making extensive improvements in the range of local services and in the access to information and advice which the public can receive when they contact any office of my Department.  There is an increasing demand today for access to information on the full range of schemes and entitlements in the social welfare area.  The use of modern technology within my Department allows a wider and more timely service to be offered to <Col N="845" /> the public.  Very considerable investments in buildings, technology and staff training have been made and will continue to be made to enhance the local services in every respect.</P>

      <P>Retirement pension is payable to persons who have reached 65 years of age and fulfil certain statutory conditions. One of these conditions is that the person must have retired from insurable employment or insurable self-employment. However, employment of inconsiderable extent, for example part-time work of less than 18 hours, which is not insurable is disregarded for the purposes of the retirement condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently introduced regulations extending social insurance cover to part-time workers earning £25 a week or more.  These regulations redefined employment of inconsiderable extent as being an employment where the employee's earnings are less than £25 per week.  This change has a consequential <Col N="846" /> effect on the retirement condition for retirement pension purposes.  Retirement pensioners who were previously engaged in part-time employment of less than 18 hours per week but earning more than £25 per week, are now regarded as being engaged in insurable employment and thus in breach of the retirement condition.</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of the retirement pension scheme is to provide a person with an alternative income to offset loss of earnings in the event of retirement from work.  The retirement condition is designed to ensure that the pension is only payable where there is in fact such a loss.  The concurrent payment of a retirement pension with earnings derived from insurable employment would be difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>I have arranged that these new provisions will not effect those already on retirement pension or who qualified prior to 6 April 1991.</P>

      <P>The rent allowance scheme to which the Deputy refers was introduced in July 1982 to provide assistance to tenants who would otherwise experience hardship as a result of the ending of rent control in that year.  Rent allowance is payable, subject to a means test, to a person who is entitled to retain possession as a tenant of a dwelling which had been subject to rent control prior to 26 July 1982.  Certain conditions relating to the terms of tenancy have also to be satisfied.</P>
      <P>A rent tribunal, established in 1983, has power to fix the level of rent and other terms of tenancy in respect of dwellings which had formerly been the subject of rent control.  Landlords are entitled to apply to the rent tribunal for a review of rent every five years.  The increases in rent to which the Deputy refers arise in the context of such reviews.  Where an increase in rent is approved by the tribunal, those tenants who are affected are entitled to claim an increase in the amount of rent allowance payable.  There are 1,042 rent allowance claims in payment at present, 197 of which have been affected by rent reviews to date.  The average weekly payment to recipients of the rent allowance is £15.43.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>Under existing provisions certain social welfare benefits are taken into account in assessing damages in personal injuries actions.  Section 68 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 provides that injury benefit payable in the five year period from the cause of the action be taken into account in assessing such damages.</P>
      <P>Section 306A of the 1981 Act contains a similar provision in respect of disability benefit, associated pay-related benefit and invalidity pension.  These arrangements are designed to ensure that people are not compensated twice for loss of earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are involved in accidents and who have no entitlement to social welfare benefits can claim supplementary welfare allowance while they are unfit for <Col N="852" /> work and pursuing compensation claims. There are no provisions in legislation which would allow supplementary welfare allowance paid in these circumstances to be taken into account in assessing compensation.</P>
    <P>The question of changing the existing arrangements for recovering social welfare payments from compensation awards arising from personal injuries is being examined by the committee on insurances costs under the auspices of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The existing legislative provisions will be reviewed in the light of the committee's report.</P>
    <P>The information requested on the amount of supplementary welfare allowance not recoverable in cases where recipients have received compensation awards is not available.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>whether his attention has been drawn to the serious problem concerning the drift netting of salmon which was 5 per cent of the national salmon catch only five years ago and is now 90 per cent and where the value of each salmon thus netted is only approximately £5 whereas each salmon caught by a tourist angler is worth anything up to £1,000 to the economy; his views on whether the practice of catching salmon by means of a drift net when they are river bound is adversely affecting the tourist trade; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to have received inaccurate information in this matter.  Far from constituting a mere 5 per cent of the total salmon catch, the drift net fishery accounted for 85 per cent of the catch in 1985.  This percentage has risen significantly over the previous decade.  The position far from deteriorating since then has gradually improved, due to the efforts of the fisheries boards' staff, assisted where possible by the garda and navy, and the Deputy will be pleased to hear that preliminary data for 1990 indicate that the drift net share of the fishery declined significantly in that year.</P>
      <P>The question of the advantage in value to the economy from releasing a marginal salmon to the recreational fishery rather than taking it commercially has been assessed in a number of studies.  The ERSI in December 1988, in a report for the Central Fisheries Board, estimated that in 1986 the gain to the economy from recreational use was 100 per cent of its commercial value.  The type of gain mentioned by the Deputy would only arise if it were assumed that the additional salmon released to the recreational fishery were caught by visiting anglers from outside the country and such expenditure would not be made in Ireland in the absence of these fish in these numbers.  Increased fishing by native anglers would entail a redistribution of income within the economy and not necessarily any net gain to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Policy for the distribution of the salmon catch between traditional inshore fishermen, native anglers and visiting <Col N="862" /> anglers requires the making of a balanced judgment between the interests of those different groups and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The importance and significance of traditional drift net fishing varies from area to area, as do traditional salmon exploitation patterns.  Given the nature of the salmon stock, from a stock management perspective, draft netting and angling are considered superior harvesting techniques.</P>
    <P>The pattern of catch also affects income distribution.  Taking this criterion I would be cautious of any general conclusion which involved significant reduction in the livelihood of such fishermen, outside the context of general conservation measures.</P>
    <P>The further improvement of the salmon fishery requires the continuation of a multi-faceted approach including protection at sea, in estuaries and on land, and continued efforts to improve and protect the habitat particularly against pollution.</P>

      <Quest>if it is intended to have any Government representative at the public inquiry to be held on 22 and 23 June, 1991 in Cullyhanna, County Armagh in connection with the shooting of Fergal Carraher on 30 December 1990; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>I share the very serious sense of disquiet which exists about the shooting of Fergal and Michael Carraher in Cullyhanna on 30 December last and I have raised the matter at every subsequent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  In doing so, I emphasised that there was widespread concern about the shootings and that a thorough, impartial and prompt investigation of all the circumstances was called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is imperative that members of the security forces should at all times act within the law; any public perception to the contrary would have the most damaging consequences.  There have been a number of controversial killings in recent times which raise very serious questions about the use of lethal force by members <Col N="864" /> of the security forces.  These cases have been raised through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat and at meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference.  I have proposed a number of changes in the procedures for handling cases of this kind.  Furthermore, I have called for a thorough examination of the whole area of the use of lethal force by the security forces, including the investigative process in such cases and the adequacy of the existing law to meet the clear needs of the situation.</P>
    <P>While the Government will not be represented at the inquiry which is being held in Cullyhanna on 22-23 June, I will be interested to read any report which may be prepared as a result of that inquiry.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a certificate of tax-free allowances was issued to the taxpayer on 22 May 1991 granting her a net tax free allowance of £965 per annum with tax deductable at table R (29 per cent).  The balance of the allowances due i.e. £4,903 has been allocated to the taxpayer's husband.  The inspector has confirmed with her employer, that the certificate which issued will be put into operation when she is next paid i.e. 17 June 1991.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the <Col N="866" /> Revenue Commissioners that based on the taxpayer's income for the year ended 5 April 1991 he is correctly liable to tax at table S (48 per cent) for the year 1991/92 with a table (S) allowance of £5,306.</P>
      <P>An amended certificate of tax free allowances granting him a total allowance of £11,337 (i.e. £218.01 weekly) will be issued to the taxpayer within the next ten days.  However, if he thinks his income for 1991/92 will not be approximately £21,000 he should advise the inspector of taxes as he would not be liable to tax at 48 per cent and therefore would not be due the table allowance of £5,306.</P>
      <P>For the year 1990/91 the taxpayer was taxed at table R (30 per cent) but was not due any table allowance so the net tax free allowances were much lower.  A review of his liability for that year is currently being carried out and the inspector will advise him of the position within the next ten days.</P>

    <P>A total of £150,000 was spent on major conservation works at Ballylahan Castle, Cong Abbey, Errew Abbey, Moyne Abbey and Burrincarra Churches over the past five years.  Works on the restoration of the Chapter House at Ballintubber Abbey are in progress and it is estimated these will cost £60,000.  It is <Col N="869" /> proposed to provide an interpretative centre at the Ceide Fields, Ballycastle, at an estimated cost of £2 million.  Works are due to begin in the near future.</P>
    <P>Routine maintenance works are carried out on a regular basis at all national monuments in State care.  It is not possible to isolate the expenditure for each monument as allocations are made on a block basis to national monuments districts for the maintenance and upkeep of monuments.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals at present to take any further monuments in County Mayo into State care.</P>

    <P>PAYE balancing statements for <Col N="870" /> 1987/88 and 1988/89 incorporating loss relief of £1,037 and £997 respectively, were issued to the taxpayer on 29 May 1991.  Cheques for the amounts overpaid i.e. £297.27 for the year 1987/88 and £349.44 for the year 1988/89 will be issued to him within the next ten days.</P>
    <P>The application for loss relief was received in February 1991.  The delay arose because the taxpayer's affairs were dealt with in two separate tax districts. The claim was not dealt with immediately in the second district because of the heavy workload at the particular time of the year.</P>

      <P>The issue of the currency is a matter for the Central Bank.  The bank informs me that it does not print banknotes for other countries &mdash; nor has it sought business of this type.  A situation of excess capacity for the printing of banknotes exists in many central banks, as well as in commercial security printing establishments.  In developing countries the trend has been, and continues to be, for the establishment of their own printing works for reasons of security and prestige. Consequently, the market for the production of banknotes commercially is a reducing one.</P>

      <P>In general, social welfare officers have fixed areas, called stations, and they investigate claims arising under every scheme as required by the circumstances. The majority of cases result in a visit to the claimant's home. However, I have introduced various new arrangements to achieve quicker results for claimants.  These changes, which can be viewed as having a degree of self-assessment, are being progressively extended.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 220 stations. There are 286 social welfare officers.

      <P>Free travel is available to all persons aged 66 years and over and to persons under that age who are blind or are permanently incapacitated and in receipt of certain social security type payments. Entitlement under the other free schemes administered by my Department is confined to the elderly or permanently incapacitated who are receiving certain social security type payments and who are living alone or only with excepted persons.  The living alone allowance is payable to recipients of certain social security type payments who are living alone and who are 66 years and over. All these entitlements are available to widows who meet the requirements set out above.</P>
      <P>Extension of the free schemes and the living alone allowance to people generally under 66 years of age or in particular to such people on widows pension would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

The difficulty with establishing additional Garda stations, apart from the high capital costs involved, is that manning them absorbs Garda manpower which can be deployed to better advantage on outdoor operational duties.</P>

    <P>The Moyross area currently receives a 24 hour patrol service from the gardaí at Mayorstone station and the Divisional Headquarters at Henry Street.  There are a number of policing initiatives, such as community policing and neighbourhood watch schemes, in operation in the area and the Garda authorities consider that the continuing allocation of resources to <Col N="896" /> these initiatives represents a better approach to dealing with crime in Moyross than the provision of an extra Garda station.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the provisions <Col N="902" /> of sections 9 and 52 of the Local Government Act, 1991, I am reviewing the functions and additional responsibilities which might be developed to local authorities. As a first step, I intend that local authorities will have more responsibility for matters such as speed limits, other than those on national roads, local traffic and parking controls, group water schemes, local by-laws, and the acquisition and disposal of land.  As regards local authority housing, while the controls exercised by my Department relate primarily to cost factors, I intend that these controls should also be reviewed.</P>

      <P>In February of this year my Department reissued a comprehensive circular on roadside trees to local authorities. This reminded them of their statutory powers and, in particular, asked them to bring to the notice of landowners any roadside trees which they considered to be an actual or potential danger to road users because they were dead, dying or seriously decayed.  The circular also reminded local authorities of their responsibilities in relation to the environment and the preservation of amenities, expressly precluded the wholesale felling of trees unless local authorities were satisfied from physical inspection that the trees were prejudical to the road or an actual or potential danger to road users, and encouraged <Col N="906" /> local authorities to undertake replacement planting.  I consider this responsible approach to represent a reasonable balance between the protection of the environment and the safety of road users.</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular cases of Galway city and county, I understand from Galway Corporation that only a small number of trees have been felled and then only after a thorough examination by expert tree surgeons.  The corporation plant replacement trees in all cases.  I understood from Galway County Council that they have a particular concern about dangerous trees because of the tragic deaths of seven people near Portumna during the winter and accordingly asked Coillte Teoranta to survey the roadside trees in the county.  Coillte Teoranta marked all trees that needed attention.  Some people were concerned that all the marked trees were for felling. This was not the case and many only required lopping or pruning.  In the light of this confusion, the county council published notices in local papers informing the public of the actual position.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government have recently published their <i>Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse.</i> This strategy was compiled with the assistance of the national co-ordinating committee on drug abuse and after extensive consultation and discussion with the various statutory and non-statutory agencies involved in this area.  It is the first time that the Government have enunciated their policy for combating drug misuse in a single document and as such examines the area in a most comprehensive manner.</P>
      <P>Included in the recommendations is a proposal to dramatically improve the primary health care role of the general practitioner <i>vis-á-vis</i> the drug misuser.</P>
      <P>It is planned that the doctor will have access to a specialist for assessment-treatment for his patients and following referral back to the general practitioner he will, as a pivotal part of the community drug team proposed in the strategy, have the capacity to deal more effectively with that patient.  Under these arrangements it is proposed that the support available to the general practitioner treating drug misusers will include counselling services, laboratory back-up and adequate security measures in surgeries.  The services of the drug treatment center will also be available to provide various support services.</P>
      <P>In this manner it is hoped that the incidence of general practitioners who over-prescribe will be substantially reduced.  My Department, however, are in line with the recommendations of the strategy, currently examining the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984 with a view to streamlining some of the more cumbersome provisions particularly where rapid intervention is required.</P>

      <P>The provision of ambulance services is a matter for each health board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The Ambulance Services Council, which was established in 1983, is responsible for overseeing the co-ordination and development of ambulance services nationally and for the training of ambulance personnel.  The chief executive officers of the health boards appoint the members of council for a three year term of office.  The present council was appointed in October 1990.</P>
      <P>I am very satisfied with the role played by the Ambulance Services Council and I have no proposals to establish a statutory body to carry out this task.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the overall pupil-teacher ratio will be reduced to 25:1 by September 1992.  This will be achieved by retaining all existing posts in 1991 and 1992 and by creating 250 new posts in September 1991, and the balance required to achieve the 25:1 ratio in September 1992; this process will aim at reducing overly large classes and meeting the needs of the disadvantaged.  The position will be reviewed at the end of 1993.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will also be aware the pupil-teacher ratio is obtained by dividing the number of teachers into the number of pupils enrolled in national schools.</P>
      <P>The figure, provisional, for total enrolments in national schools on 30 September 1990 is 543,000.  The total number of teachers at present is 20,447, giving an overall pupil-teacher ratio of 26.5:1.</P>
      <P>Projected enrolment for September 1991 is 534,400.  The estimated number of teachers is 20,700, giving an overall pupil-teacher ratio for the year 1991-92 of 25.8:1.</P>

      <P>The position is that the administration of the higher education grants scheme is statutorily entrusted to local authorities and details of particular cases would not normally be available in my Department.  It is understood that the Local Government Financial Provisions (No. 2) Act, 1983 provides a local authority with the power to set off amounts owing by it to a person against amounts due by that person to the authority in respect of a charge.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with the agreement between the Government and INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Eoin Baisde Senior Girls national school there were 449 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1990, which <Col N="921" /> warrants a staff of principal plus 13 assistants for the 1991-92 school year.  The school will also have the services of a full-time remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>The only exceptions that can be made to the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. If the school authorities feel that the school may qualify under either of these exceptions my Department will be happy to examine any application received.</P>

      <P>In the interests of efficiency and economy it has been decided that surgical procedures under general anaesthetic should be discontinued at the Military Hospital, Collins Barracks, Cork.  In recent years, surgery carried out at the hospital has generally been of a minor nature only.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 June 1991, members of the Permanent Defence Force in the Cork area who require surgical treatment will in general be treated in local civilian hospitals.</P>
      <P>The only staff of the hospital affected by the decision referred to above is one member of the Army nursing service.  In that regard it is envisaged that for the foreseeable future the person in question will be assigned to other duties in the hospital.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="923" /> European Communities (Merchandise Road Transport) Regulations, 1988 included a provision under which persons who could prove that they either operated or managed a lawful merchandise road transport business prior to 1 January 1975, could qualify for a certificate of competence on the basis of this experience.</P>
      <P>The person named in the question applied under this provision, but the evidence submitted was insufficient to support the application.  Accordingly, a certificate of competence could not be granted in this case.  I should add that there has been protracted correspondence between the applicant and my Department in this matter.</P>
