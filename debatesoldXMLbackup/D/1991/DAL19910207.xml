      <P>Has the Taoiseach made any progress on the amending legislation concerning the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General which he promised in this House he would expedite, in view of the fact that the Comptroller is currently working under legislation enacted by the Houses of Parliament at Westminster in 1866 and in view of the fact that NESC have indicated that the enhancement of the Comptroller's powers would be important to the control of public spending.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1991. - Financial Resolution No. 6: General (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(The Taoiseach.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extra £9 million in the agricultural budget for 1991 to give 18,000 additional farmers headage payments for the first time.  I am glad the Minister for Agriculture and Food refuted today on radio the argument put forward by Joe McCartin, MEP.  The Minister stated clearly that this will happen and I am glad that all County Galway will be included for headage payments. Eleven thousand farmers will qualify for increased payments.  This is welcome because 1990 was a particularly difficult year.  Farmers are concerned at the prospect of severe cuts in farm supports.</P>
      <P>We should examine very closely the proposals put forward by Commissioner MacSharry.  He has warned time and again of the surpluses in Europe and pointed out that 80 per cent of farm subsidies are going to the larger 20 per cent of farmers.  Over 90 per cent of Irish beef is going into intervention and this cannot continue.  We are all in favour of reform. The Minister has said that the small to medium type farmers should be protected in any reform.  Many leaked documents have been discussed referring to beef intervention prices, cuts in grain prices and milk quotas.  We should have an opportunity to debate these matters to ensure that any changes will not affect smallholders.  I have heard reports that payments will be based on livestock units per hectare.  That would be a drastic step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2008" /> Quotas on sheep production would militate against smallholders or against farmers who were not in sheep in 1990. The top 10 per cent of farmers in Europe are well able to look after themselves.  It is a matter of protecting the small to medium size farmer.</P>
    <P>I regret that the problem of flooding is not a major priority.  In view of the severe flooding experienced in early January, the Office of Public Works should look seriously at arterial drainage.  Every year areas of south Galway around Ardrahan, and mid-Galway around Turloughmore and also in the north Galway area are liable to severe flooding.  We have set up Shannon Forum and drainage committees to deal with maintenance of the rivers.  It is time for the Office of Public Works to deal with some of the obstacles which are causing flooding.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the problem of large classes in primary schools is being tackled.  The overall pupil-teacher ratio will be reduced to 25:1 in 1992 and in second level schools a pupil-teacher ratio of 19:1 will be phased in over 1991 and 1992.  The INTO have stated that 1,400 teaching jobs will be provided over the next two years in the primary schools. This is a welcome development.  I am also glad that there will be increased capitation grants and that extra money will be made available to the disadvantaged at all levels of education.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme has been the subject of much comment in the media.  The basic idea behind the scheme is very good and I hope the Minister will look at projects which were in the process of negotiation for BES funding in County Galway, particularly in the tourist areas. Many projects have gone through the planning process in accordance with the county development plan and have been approved by Bord Fáilte.  In many cases these projects are designed to cater for what are known as the &ldquo;new tourists&rdquo; in that self-catering accommodation is a priority.  I hope these schemes will succeed in attracting tourists by providing the facilities which are badly needed.  My concern is that if Irish entrepreneurs do <Col N="2009" /> not provide these facilities, French or German companies will.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the whole question of the operations of An Post will come before a Dáil committee.  In County Galway efforts have been made to cut back on services in rural areas, particularly by the provision of letter boxes placed on county roads.  The idea is that people living along that road will have to travel up to a mile to collect their mail.  This is particularly difficult for elderly people and it is not a good service.  There is talk now about laying off 1,500 people and closing down 550 post offices.  At the same time An Post are saying they intend to instal more and more of these letter boxes.  Imagine the problems if the postman puts letters into the wrong boxes or when the boxes are interfered with and letters are stolen. These problems will be increased and multiplied if these drastic proposals go ahead.  It will be devastating for rural Ireland.  I hope the committee will consider this matter in great detail and elicit more information as to what is envisaged in changing the delivery service in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister for the Environment on the funding that has been made available for county roads over the last couple of years.  As I mentioned earlier, we had problems in County Galway, the west and in other parts of the country.  There are proposals with the Department for increased funding to repair damage to county roads from flooding and high winds in early January.  I hope the allocation for county roads will reflect the damage that was done.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done his best to provide money for housing and there are many vacant houses throughout the country that could be improved using reconstruction grants.  I hope the Minister will be in a position soon to reintroduce house improvement grants so that the necessary repairs can be carried out to those houses.  Let me make a suggestion that I made before.  The income limit for reconstruction loans, £10,000, should be increased to allow <Col N="2010" /> more people avail of house improvement loans to carry out necessary repairs.</P>
    <P>In the health area I hope the rationalisation that has been talked about by the Minister for Health in relation to hospitals will soon take place.  In Galway city we have two fine hospitals, the University College Hospital which was known as the regional hospital and Merlin Park Hospital.  It is certainly time to have one major hospital for the city of Galway and the region.  There are proposals with the health board to sell some of the land attached to Merlin Park and move the specialities and facilities to the regional hospital.  This should be undertaken as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the budget implements the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Government have continued the policy of reducing borrowing and bringing in tax reductions, and there are positive measures to help the disadvantaged and raise the income of the less well off.  The Government are promoting the creation of new jobs.  We have seen investment in tourism, the extension of the section 23 relief for construction, extra teachers and extra money for community health care.  I hope the budget will be successful in its aims.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, this is the ninth successive year that I have had the obligation, indeed the bounden duty, to stand up in this echo Chamber and make a plea for the people of County Louth, the forgotten area of this land, an area sadly neglected by all Governments in the recent past.  Despite many urgings the net result has been one of almost total disregard, little recognition and certainly no help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis in the Border areas started in 1969 with the outbreak of the war in the Six Counties and that marked the demise of the biggest town in Ireland, Dundalk, a town of 30,000 inhabitants that had enjoyed the highest rate of employment outside the cities over the years.  Twenty two years later the sad reality of life in the Border areas is that the unemployment figures are double the national average.  They vary between 32 <Col N="2011" /> and 34 per cent; the national average is 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>I listened last evening to Deputy Michael D. Higgins expressing righteous indignation that the rate of unemployment here stood at 18 per cent.  How would he feel if he represented County Louth where the rate is double the national average?  That is a crisis but it has not raised the profile of the Border areas as being in need of remedial help by any Government.  There is a complacency here, an inertia that grips Governments. There is a belief that while the Ulster troubles last the Border areas are expendable. That is not good enough.  There are parts of my town, and, indeed, other Border towns, where there is 100 per cent unemployment in housing estates in deprived areas, 100 per cent unemployment in households and there is very little hope that that will be remedied in the near future.</P>
    <P>On budget night I expressed my disappointment at the lack of comment in the budget and the lack of forward planning for 1992-93 and what it means to the Border areas.  I would have thought that the Minister would have addressed the problem in a more definite manner.  He did reduce the VAT by 2 per cent, leaving a difference of 6 per cent.  I would have thought he would have taken the opportunity to reduce it by another three points because next year he will have a mighty problem.</P>
    <P>The real problem that exists in that regard is the lack of information emanating from the Government to the people to whom they owe an explanation, particularly the people in the customs clearance service in the public sector, the customs officers.  In my town they total almost 400 people, 400 jobs; and these people have been left blissfully unaware of their future.  What will happen to these people?  Will they get compensation?  Will the people in the private sector, who have been harried and harrassed by the Revenue Commissioners in recent years and made put very expensive computer type equipment into their businesses, just close down and be told to walk away? <Col N="2012" /> Will they get compensation?  Will the Government seek compensation from Brussels?  Those people are entitled to some information.  They are getting none.</P>
    <P>I realise better than most that the geographical location of the Border does not always attract industrialists to the region because of the troubles that occur on our doorstep.  That is why I cannot comprehend the failure of successive Governments to decentralise an industry to the town of Dundalk.  I accept they cannot get an industrialist and demand that he set up in a particular town but they have within their control the ability to decentralise and locate a sizeable industry, an acceptable industry in a town that, by any standards, is crying out for help.  They have failed to do that.  What they have done is to locate industries in Athlone, in Sligo, in one horse towns in the west and have neglected the town with the most unacceptable unemployment figures. I did not invent the statistics.  They are cold statistical facts compiled by the State.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to give special consideration to the problems of County Louth.  The Taoiseach took me to task on budget night, he suggested that I was out of line for speaking about the problems of the Border areas and he told me that the 48 hour rule had helped the Border area but I wish to say to him that it has not, but that it has kept jobs in Ireland. I welcome that and I supported that particular action but it does not specifically help the Border areas.  The amount of money from here being spent across the Border was horrific.  It was an absolute haemorrhage.  Tours from every hamlet and village in Ireland were going across the Border.  They were not going to Dundalk, Carrickmacross or Monaghan to spend their money.  They were going specifically to spend their money across the Border.  The only reason they stopped in Border towns was for a cup of tea or perhaps to go to the toilet but this was of no benefit to the Border towns.</P>
    <P>The next item I wish to address &mdash; I want to be unashamedly parochial in this <Col N="2013" />&mdash; is the hypocritical targeting of the cigarette industry.  I would not advise anybody to smoke but I believe that the targeting of this industry in recent years has been hypocritical in the extreme. When one contrasts the damage done by drink, and its social cost, to every family in this land, the damage done by cigarettes pales into insignificance.  This country is awash with drink.  Government statistics show that young children are starting to drink at 12 years of age. The social consequences of that are tragic.  A number of young girls, have at the tender age of 15 or 16 years, come to me pregnant.  In many such cases, the girls became pregnant by married men after visiting public houses.  This bears witness to the social tragedy of drink. The number of wives and husbands, too, who are battered as a consequence of drinking is alarming.  There are also the victims of incest who are interfered with on a daily basis by people with drink on them.  All of this is far more alarming and, I believe, far more injurious than any damage that might be done by smoking cigarettes.  People who smoke cigarettes are well aware of the danger to their health but for many, particularly the unemployed and people on low incomes, it is an acceptable and worthwhile risk. To put 10p tax on a packet of cigarettes can only be described as mean and vindictive. It hits my town yet again.  While I cannot justify cigarette smoking on the grounds of employment, it means a great deal to the people who earn their living in P. J. Carroll Company Limited.  The contrast in the treatment of cigarette smoking and the abuse of drinking leaves me to suggest that the Minister is running on sight, as they say in coursing parlance when a dog loses sight of the hare.</P>
    <P>I would like to commend the Minister, although it was long overdue, for the recognition in the budget of the double taxation of people who live in the Border area but who in many cases have had no option but to obtain employment in the Six Counties.  They have had to endure double taxation.  For the life of me I do not know how any civil servant could justify that immorality.  The Minister has <Col N="2014" /> acknowledged this and these people have been included in the entitlement to an £800 PAYE allowance.  I applaud him for that measure.  However I would like him, in the Finance Bill, to address a remaining anomaly.  People who have worked in the North or in England and who have retired to Ireland are regarded as self employed and are not allowed that particular allowance.  The Minister may need, therefore, to bring in legislation to create a new section.  I hope he will address that in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my disappointment at the carers' allowance.  In last year's budget I applauded this new allowance very enthusiastically but shortly afterwards I was horrified that fewer than 2,000 people were in receipt of this allowance.  I understand that while the number has increased this year there are people who are in receipt of a carers' allowance as low as £2 per week.  The many people who keep their aged relatives at home should be lauded and applauded.  That allowance which has the potential to be very good is too narrow. It should be widened and expanded.</P>
    <P>I now want to move from the parochial to the global context.  Perhaps I am the only TD in the House, but that will not deter me, who will lament our lack of contribution to the Gulf War.  We have been a member of the United Nations for 35 years and we have reaped the benefits of membership.  The Taoiseach was emperor of Europe, a role which he carried out quite successfully in recent times. We have had the begging bowl out on a permanent basis to get the fruits of what is available from Europe.  The poorest country in the European Community, Portugal, gets twice its contribution but we get five times the amount we put into Europe.</P>
    <P>We have to grow up and mature as a nation.  We have to accept our obligations as well as accepting what we can milk from the system.  Those obligations mean supporting the aims of the United Nations.  We have once again allowed England, a country we love to hate, and America to do our fighting for us.  We have not contributed a sou.  I think the <Col N="2015" /> time has come to make a contribution voluntarily in some way.  I am not suggesting that Irish soldiers, who are not really equipped for war &mdash; let us face that &mdash; should go to the Gulf but I am suggesting that we should make a cash contribution.  In any event we may be asked for a contribution before the year is out.</P>
    <P>We could look at the possibility of having a field hospital but we should put our shoulder to the wheel and support the United Nations.  In saying that I also want to express my personal support for the action of America.  Nobody wants to see the war continuing and nobody wants to see people dying but the war was inevitable because it is a war about future peace.  I think we are very fortunate that the Americans and the British are prepared to stand up to a despot &mdash; a man who is clearly mad.  The Americans waited for five and a half months in the desert and gave this madman every possible opportunity to pull out of Kuwait.  I think the Irish nation should acknowledge that.  I deplore the recent attacks made on America by the gentleman on the loony left.  I would remind them that we have had very strong ethnic ties with America from the days of the Famine until the present.  There is a 40 million strong Irish ethnic group in America.  In the past five years they have contributed £150 million to the International Fund for Ireland.  In the past five years young Irish boys and girls 75,000 have got US visas.  America has never been a colonising country.  They got involved in the Second World War very reluctantly and refloated Europe with the Marshall Aid Plan directly after the war had ended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>I intervene to advise the Deputy that some three minutes now remain of the time available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that when this war is over the Taoiseach and the Government of the day should make it a priority to ensure the banning of <Col N="2016" /> weapons which are horrific and frightening. The double standards of countries who have sold weapons to these unfortunate people in the Middle East and who are now threatening the future of the world is appalling.  I deplore the double standards of the German Government who have armed them up to the teeth and now refuse to support the manpower in the Gulf: I understand 22,000 of their soldiers have pulled out on sick leave or on conscience grounds.  The banning of the sale of weapons is imperative for world peace.</P>
      <P>I plead with the Taoiseach to give a fairer deal to the people who live in the Border region.  By any standards they have not had a fair deal in the last 22 years.  They have borne the brunt of the Ulster troubles on behalf of mother Ireland.  It is surely an abuse of Government when the unemployment figures of Dundalk, Ardee and Drogheda remain as high as they do.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to invite the Taoiseach, instead of going to Kerry this year on his holidays, to come to County Louth &mdash; the forgotten county of Ireland &mdash; and spend a week not necessarily with the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk, but with me.  I will show him the real problems and the real deprivations that exist in the Border area.  I know that the deprivation that exists in the Border area may be unknown to him because his own two Deputies have not been vocal in enunciating the problems that confront people who have to live in that area.  They have not made any noise in this Chamber.  I would have thought they would have had a word in his ear but obviously that is not so.  I extend an invitation to the Taoiseach to come and be my guest for his summer holidays this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget this year has an important extra dimension to its overall purpose.  In addition to the normal economic and fiscal role, this budget starts to implement the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> as the first segment of our new ten year strategy to transform Irish society <Col N="2017" />&mdash; and place Ireland firmly among the advanced European nations &mdash; by the turn of the century.</P>
      <P>The budget was formulated against a difficult international background, which has created world-wide political and economic uncertainty.  There has been a considerable slowdown in the world economy in recent months, with definite signs of recession in some of our major trading partners.  The war in the Gulf; and doubts about the outcome of the GATT negotiations are having an unsettling affect.  This budget, therefore, had to be constructed in a way that would achieve three broad strategic objectives.</P>
      <P>First, we were determined that the steady economic and social progress of the last four years and the improvement in the public finances would be continued. Secondly, we wished to begin inplementing the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> by making the necessary provision for the steps to be taken this year and in preparation for future years.  Thirdly, the implications for Ireland of the uncertain international situation clearly demanded that we adopt a careful and prudent approach to the budget and especially to our financial and economic projections.</P>
      <P>This budget continues the policy firmly established in recent budgets, of reducing borrowings to very low levels, of tax reform and reduction, and important improvements in social provision for the vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society.  We have been able to sustain some progress on all these fronts, despite the deterioration in the international economic climate and the consequent prospect of a slowing down in our own rate for growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget, is seen by the public as striking the right balance for our current circumstances.  There has of course to be a degree of caution, because of the world situation and the possibility that assumptions will not hold good, that world events, and particularly the tragic war in the Gulf, will give rise to further problems.  It was not an occasion for taking unnecessary risks.  The important thing is that we have not allowed the <Col N="2018" /> uncertainties to divert us from what we know to be the right way forward; from sticking to our successful, proven, policies; from holding a steady course through uncertain waters.</P>
    <P>To those who, before the budget, thought we could not hold the line, let me state clearly: there has been no halt to budgetary discipline; there has been no halt to tax reform; and there has been no halt to social progress.  Instead, we have moved forward purposefully in all these areas and have actually expanded our agenda.  The budget has delivered solid benefits, while holding responsibly to discipline.</P>
    <P>This budget clearly confirms and continues our policy of sound financial management. That cannot be disputed.  The objective is a current budget deficit of 1 per cent of GNP and Exchequer borrowing of 1.9 per cent.  Outstanding progress has been made over the last four years in reducing the current budget deficit, Government borrowing, especially foreign borrowing, and the ratio of national debt to national output.  Year after year the outcome at the end of the year has been better than the targets we set in the budget, clear proof of consistent good mangement.</P>
    <P>In the four year period to 1990 the current budget has been brought down from 8.3 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 0.7 per cent last year.  This year, it has been set at 1 per cent and the Government have undertaken to bring it into broad balance by 1993.  Similarly, Exchequer borrowing has been reduced from 13 per cent to 2 per cent of GNP, or in money terms from £2,145 million in 1986 to £462 million in 1990.  I remind the House that these borrowing figures, both last year's and this year's, are the lowest for over 40 years.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress also that the actual amount to be borrowed this year will in all probability be substantially below the official target, we have set, because of the sale of a majority stake in Irish Life. While this will, of course have little effect on the underlying borrowing level, it will mean that there will be little actual addition to the national debt this year, <Col N="2019" /> with subsequent savings in interest in future years.</P>
    <P>Without continued reduction of the burden of debt, all our aspirations will be frustrated.  This is why the Government considered it essential, even in the difficult circumstances of this year and despite many conflicting demands, to continue the downward pressure on borrowing levels.  It was important to signal our determination to hold on to the gains that have been made and to continue the process, until our goals have been achieved.  With borrowing levels rising in Germany and Britain, our decision to continue to reduce borrowing has sent a strong positive signal of our resolve to financial markets everywhere around the world.</P>
    <P>Since 1988 increases in the national debt have been minimal.  Today it stands at just over £25 billion and the foreign debt has actually been reduced from £9.7 billion in 1987 to £8.85 billion at the end of 1990.  The debt/GNP ratio fell eight percentage points last year to 111 per cent, making a drop of 20 points from its peak in 1987.  Further progress will be made this year.  We are on target for reducing it towards 100 per cent of GNP by 1993.  Our longer term target is a level more in keeping with our EC partners.</P>
    <P>Service of the national debt, despite the record reduction in annual borrowing that has been made and the savings achieved by better management of the debt portfolio, has nevertheless increased from just under £2 billion in 1986 to £2.4 billion in 1991.  Looked at in one way, that is a significant containment compared to previous years, but it continues to be a massive overhead, which remained a major obstacle to our economic and social development.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, now established a National Treasury Management Agency, directly responsible to the Minister for Finance, but operating outside traditional Civil Service structures in a strictly competitive market environment.  The agency will utilise the most sophisticated tools of debt management in order to <Col N="2020" /> achieve maximum savings on debt servicing.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates is the basis of the budget.  That is where the quality of a budget is decided.  The Government subjected the Estimates to detailed examination and assessment again this year.  The key indispensable element in the improvement in the public finances since 1987 was the control of and the reduction in Government expenditure. There should be no doubt about that. Other factors helped but that was the core element.  The level of Government expenditure has been brought down from around 55 per cent of GNP in 1986 to around 41 per cent this year, a fall of 14 points.  I do not know of any other country in Europe or in the OECD in the past 30 years, which has succeeded over the relatively short space of four years in making a downward adjustment of that magnitude.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the publication of the 1991 Book of Estimates in December last year, the Government carried out a further final rigorous review of expenditure in every Department.  This produced further reductions of £33 million which are shown in the budget table.  This was achieved despite the fact that in many sectors expenditure had to be increased in order to draw down Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>There is no question of allowing Government expenditure to rise again as a proportion of GNP above the present level of a little above 40 per cent. Improvements in services will have to be paid for out of economic growth, which has also to provide the means for easing the tax burden and maintaining a steady improvement in the public finances.  I wish to categorically reject the suggestion that the programme involves any relaxation or return to the days of big spending. There has been no policy change whatever.  Instead, we have reinforced and strengthened our medium term targets.</P>
    <P>There has been some suggestion by certain commentators that the alleged cost of the programme raises the spectre of a return to high borrowing.  But if the record is examined, most of those who <Col N="2021" /> are sceptical of the new programme were equally sceptical about the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in 1987 and its implications for borrowing.  The success of that programme over the last three years proved them wrong.  I would not like respected commentators to misread the situation and this Government's determination a second time.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is a model of economic, financial, and social responsibility.</P>
    <P>Those for whom the size of the national debt and borrowing are the main concern should, in fact, welcome the agreement reached on a new programme and the stability it ensures in the economy and the public finances.  The truth is that the Government's success in dealing with the public finances and reducing debt and borrowing since 1987 can in large measure be attributed to building a consensus around a number of key objectives, allowing balanced progress to be made on the public finances, employment, tax reform and social equity.</P>
    <P>A good deal of the critical comment outside this House has focused on the issue of public service pay in recent times, both before the new programme was agreed and since.  Some economic observers talk about the public service as some kind of impersonal body isolated from life's realities, unnecessarily absorbing a large slice of the country's resources.  The reality is something totally different.  For the most part the public service is made up of staff who provide the services to the community which everybody, including the commentators themselves, would accept and demand as being an essential part of the type of caring democratic society that we all cherish.</P>
    <P>When we refer to the public service, we are talking of the doctors, nurses and other staff who provide the health services, teachers who educate our children, gardaí and soldiers who provide security for us all and who maintain law and order, welfare officers and social workers who deal with the unemployed and others who are disadvantaged, and so on, not forgetting those who have the task of raising <Col N="2022" /> the revenue needed to meet the cost of all these services.  These members of our national community perform vital functions and the overwhelming majority are highly qualified and dedicated people.  They expect to be treated as fairly as possible by the community they serve in terms of remuneration, reasonable account being taken of the rates available outside the public service, with due allowance for the capacity of the public finances.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the crucial question is how, as a country, we can afford public services of the size and quality we aspire to without incurring levels of taxation which are unsustainable and damaging to the economy as a whole.  <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i> attempted to provide a balanced response to that key question. There was an acceptance that the numbers in the public service would have to be reduced significantly, that economies should be effected, especially where there was an overlapping of functions between different agencies, and that greater efficiency and better management should be promoted and achieved.  In the period 1987 to date, public service numbers were reduced from 217,000 to 199,000; the efficiency audit group were set up; major efficiency studies in Office of Public Works and the health area were completed and the new system of administrative budgets was developed.  There was a significant rationalisation of State bodies, and a substantial investment in technology took place with the result that a number of our larger Departments are now as technologically advanced as many of the most progressive private sector companies.</P>
    <P>Special pay increases arise from independent arbitration awards on claims for particular groups.  Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, there was agreement by the public service unions in the national interest that a large amount of the special pay awards would be deferred from 1987 to 1991.  This agreement was of very significant benefit to the Exchequer for the critical period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It means, however, that a major portion of <Col N="2023" /> the cost of these different specials have to be paid in 1991, in addition to the cost of the general pay increase &mdash; 4 per cent &mdash; provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> For 1991, therefore, a total of £245 million is being provided for pay increases &mdash; £54 million in the published Estimates and £191 million in the budget.  That is a major increase with which we have to deal.</P>
    <P>The overall provision for the Exchequer pay and pensions bill in 1991 is, therefore, £3,422 million, an increase of 8 per cent over the 1990 provisional outturn.  However, in the new programme there will be a further moratorium on all new claims, and the restrictions on local bargaining including the limit of 3 per cent will not apply earlier than 1993.  The public service unions have agreed again to the same type of procedure in this programme as they agreed to in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the rising cost of Exchequer pay and pensions presents a major problem in the management of the public finances and in the framing of any budget.  At the same time, public servants are entitled to reasonable standards of remuneration and conditions of service relative to the private sector.  The only way to reconcile these apparently conflicting demands must lie in consistent and unremitting efforts to limit overall numbers in the public service by better management, increased efficiency and increasing use of technology.  The new programme provides a clear framework in the memorandum of understanding within which this greater efficiency can be negotiated and achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which this budget starts to implement, is the best long term strategy for attacking in a coherent way our persistent unemployment problem, including long term unemployment.  It is a comprehensive programme for development, and the budget provides for the Government's special commitments under the programme in 1991. <Col N="2024" /> More than that, it ensures the continuance of the basic underlying financial and economic conditions which make growth and development possible, and from which the defeat of unemployment will in due course follow.</P>
    <P>In this budget and in the new programme, the interdependent relationship between economic development and social progress is clearly stated and emphasised.  Arising from the programme, the scope of the social provisions of the budget has been broadened to include health, education and housing, with continuing concentration on the problems of disadvantage and of low income families.</P>
    <P>The critical achievement has been to renew the consensus between the social partners and to develop a new and more ambitious strategy for the next three years and extending to the end of the decade.  This firmly establishes the consensus approach to our economic and social affairs.  It is this fundamental change in the national ethos and the enormous unquantifiable bonus that this brings right across the board that the critics fail to take into account in their restricted evaluation and assessment of the programme.  The fact that we can agree is more important than the precise detail of what we agree about.  Once the consensus is there, the targets, the projections and so on, if shown to be unrealistic or unattainable, can be adjusted by agreement.  The national consensus provides the basis for a sustained renewal of confidence, increased investment and higher employment, all within the framework of a sound economy.  Its benefits continued to be reflected in the economic achievements of 1990, and indeed in the cumulative advances that have been made since 1987, a situation which has caused the English newspaper, <i>The Guardian</i> to say about the Irish economy that &ldquo;amazing things are happening in Ireland&rdquo;, or the Annual Economic Report of the EC Commission to state in its chapter on convergence that &ldquo;the most spectacular results were achieved in Ireland&rdquo;.  The critics do not seem to <Col N="2025" /> understand the enormous and inestimable economic benefit that flows from the atmosphere created by consensus, industrial peace, certainty in planning and a spirit of co-operation.</P>
    <P>At the most recent ECOFIN Council, the President of the EC Commission, Jacques Delors, praised Ireland's efforts to redress its economy since 1987, and said &mdash; this is important &mdash; the reason for our success was through sticking to a rigid programme of fiscal management in agreement with the social partners.</P>
    <P>The year, 1990, was the fourth year of sustained economic progress, further consolidating the recovery that began here in 1987.  For the second year running, we had exceptional economic growth, close to 5 per cent, the best performance in ten years, and also the highest growth rate in the European Community.  In the period 1987-90 our GNP has grown by an average annual rate of 4.25 per cent.  From being well under two-thirds of the Community average of national income per head five years ago, we will be approaching 70 per cent by 1991, demonstrating that a process of convergence is taking place.  We are catching up.</P>
    <P>In 1991, we are anticipating continued growth of 2.25 per cent.  Some of the criticism of the budget is based on the suggestion that this projected growth rate is over-optimistic, and that a shortfall in revenue will throw the budget off course during the year.  This is a fairly standard criticism, and in recent years has invariably been proved unfounded.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the economic forecast underlying this budget is too optimistic. A range of relevant forecasts &mdash; issued this month &mdash; suggests GNP growth rates from 1.5 per cent to almost 2.5 per cent.  Our post-budget forecast, at 2.25 per cent, falls comfortably within this range.  In general, over the years the official Department of Finance Estimates have proven to be the most accurate, probably because they are more directly related to the final make-up and impact of the budget.  Some private sector post-budget forecasts envisage domestic output growth of 2 per cent or more, <Col N="2026" /> which is broadly in line with that underlying the budget.</P>
    <P>The view taken of external growth is one crucial element in any macro-economic forecast.  The forecast of Irish economic developments assumes external growth as projected by the European Commission in December.  Recent reductions have brought world oil prices well below the level the Commission then assumed.  However, our economic forecast makes the prudent assumption that any beneficial effects on world growth of lower average oil prices would be offset by the negative effects of the greater uncertainty brought about by the Gulf War.</P>
    <P>An essential difference in the budgetary context between the various forecasts relates to investment propects and expectations for construction.  In the short term some investors may be tempted to defer decisions because of the uncertainty induced by the Gulf conflict.  On the other hand, investment this year will continue to benefit from the EC Structural Funds, and business investment should benefit as industry gears up for the Single European Market.  Taking into account the overall budgetary stance and its various specific measures, an estimate of the order of 3 per cent volume growth for the construction industry is scarcely unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The very major economic uncertainties facing the world are unfortunately a fact of life.  They pose particular problems for countries which, like us, depend on external trade and, critically, on imported energy, but Government cannot wait until the outlook becomes clearer.  Assumptions must be made, and budgets formed and implemented even as events are unfolding.  Those assumptions must be as realistic as circumstances may permit but, on the other hand, we must not over-react to international uncertainties. One of the early effects of the Gulf War, unexpectedly, was to bring oil prices down.  We should not underestimate the worth of the progress made at home and the capacity it provides to withstand adverse external developments now as against our previous capacity.  Our <Col N="2027" /> workforce is skilled, educated and motivated, our economy is competitive, the new programme ensures industrial harmony, over the years immediately ahead. I believe that we are capable of progress this year, despite the uncertain external conditions that now prevail.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the predicted increase in tax revenue is optimistic in relation to the economic forecast does not stand up.  Revenue is predicted to represent the same percentage of GNP in 1991 as in 1990.  Put quite simply, the budget figures imply that we expect revenue, in aggregate, to grow in line with money GNP in 1991.</P>
    <P>Unlike some previous occasions, we have experienced fast growth, while maintaining a low level of inflation.  Low inflation growth means that gains made should be sustained.  It is a remarkable achievement that, despite the recent oil price shock following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, inflation in Ireland has nonetheless continued on a downward trend, ending the year at 2.7 per cent among the lowest in the European Community, compared with an inflation rate still close to 10 per cent in Britain.  In 1991, we are expecting a rate of inflation in the region of 3 per cent, a reduction by nearly ½ per cent on the average for 1990.  This position is in sharp contrast with our experience in the two previous oil shocks. Whereas very often in the past decade budgets contributed substantially to annual inflation, the present budget will have a negligible impact on inflation of 0.1 per cent.  Likewise, the pay rises envisaged in the new programme are fully consistent with the maintenance of low single figure inflation.</P>
    <P>A firm exchange rate policy has helped us to secure low inflation, and that in turn has enabled us to maintain over a four year period, and into the future, a stable exchange rate which is of fundamental importance in the economic and financial situation.  In March 1987, the Irish pound was worth around 2.67 DM.  Today, four years later, it is still worth around 2.67 DM, give or take a pfennig.  Irish businesses, which borrowed DMs, will <Col N="2028" /> have gained, as have German investors who have bought Irish Government bonds.  In contrast with earlier years, we have succeeded in establishing a firm link within the European Monetary System to the currency of the strongest economy in Europe.  This is good preparation for full participation in economic and monetary union.  This has also enabled us, for the first time ever, over the past two years to keep interest rates several points below British interest rates, although of course, internationally, interest rates remain high.</P>
    <P>The uncertain international background makes it particularly difficult to forecast the trend of interest rates at present.  Last week we saw pressures arising from German unification pushing up official interest rates by ½ per cent in Germany, while at the same time weakness in the US economy led to a cut of ½ per cent in the US discount rate.  In budgetary terms, these movements are not significant, given the magnitudes involved in the budgetary aggregates.  In any event, the increase in official German interest rates has, so far, had little impact on market rates, even in Germany itself.</P>
    <P>Given the extent to which emigration can fluctuate with the economic fortunes of the UK and the US in particular, the real measure of progress in our economy is the trend of employment in Ireland. The basic aims of Government economic policy are to provide the conditions for a substantial and sustained increase in employment, to encourage investment for this purpose, and to act directly to bring jobs on stream where possible.  The right financial conditions for investment, tax reform, social policy, specific measures in the different employment sectors, can all contribute to a growth in employment.  The budget will on this occasion directly create some employment; in education, community health care, tourism, and construction.</P>
    <P>Net employment increased in the three years to April 1990 by 40,000 and by a further significant amount in the course of last year.  Emigration declined by 15,000 in the year to April 1990, and the signs are that there has been a further <Col N="2029" /> signficant fall since.  Unemployment was brought down from its peak of over a quarter of a million in the winter of 1987 to 215,000 last May, but because of the fall in emigration it has increased somewhat since then.  It is also encouraging that unemployment among school leavers has continued to fall.  The best strategy to increase employment and to reduce unemployment is a sustained high level of economic performance, as well as targeted measures following the approach recommended in the new programme.</P>
    <P>A problem in our economy a few years ago was the absence of a positive link between economic growth and employment. I am sure a number of Deputies will have heard me say from time to time that this was a dilemma which we did not seem to be able to solve and that we did not seem to be able to translate economic growth into employment.  Fortunately, that scene has changed.  Research has now shown that one of the most significant changes brought about by the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was the re-establishment of a positive link between growth and employment.  Since 1987, every 1 per cent growth in output is producing a rise in employment of two in every thousand.  This new and positive link between output and employment will continue under the new programme, which maintains the low inflation competitive conditions first established by the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>The new programme, carries forward the approach of its predecessor to employment creation; 20,000 new jobs are to be created each year in manufacturing industry and the international services, with carefully targeted incentives and selective development measures.  An additional 5,000 jobs on average are being created in tourism. Objectives for the construction industry, the marine, forestry and commercial State companies are also set out.</P>
    <P>Employment in Ireland primarily depends on our success as a trading nation, in relation to both goods and services. Our achievements in the last four <Col N="2030" /> years have been outstanding and unprecedented. The surplus on both the balance of trade and balance of payments was continued for the fourth year in succession in 1990, an unprecedented performance for the Irish economy, and the balance of payments surplus is likely to remain near its 1989 level, due to an improved balance on services, a slowdown in profit repatriations, and the increase in EC transfers.</P>
    <P>The level of investment, which is the key to employment, increased by about 10 per cent for the second year running. This is the best performance for at least a decade, and puts us back at or near the top of the European league.  The new programme is intended to maintain the conditions here for a strong and positive investment climate over the coming decade.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to demonstrate that it is a very attractive location for major overseas investment.  Many leading international corporations at the forefront of technology have decided to locate their European manufacturing operations here.  The fact that high-quality corporations such as Intel, Motorola, Maxtor, Seagate, Brother, Fujitsu Isotec and Yamanouchi, established in Ireland during 1990, rather than anywhere else in the EC, shows that our economic criteria are right for the establishment of successful modern technological enterprises, including the best and brightest young workforce in Europe.  That is the advantage of having a good, bright, highly skilled and well-trained workforce.</P>
    <P>With the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin, the Government have successfully pioneered a new development which will make the city an important financial centre in Europe; 150 companies, including some of the world's leading financial institutions, have already committed themselves to locating in the centre, creating 2,500 jobs.  The time limit for approvals of new firms has been extended to the end of 1994, and the Finance Act will extend the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to the end of the year 2005.  The 10 per cent rate of tax for firms in the Shannon Customs Free <Col N="2031" /> Airport Zone will be similarly extended to 2005.</P>
    <P>While more than half of all new manufacturing jobs were created in the past three years in Irish-owned companies, there is an increasingly urgent need to build more such companies with the scale and scope to compete in the Single Market.  The firms which will get priority from the State agencies will be those which show a clear commitment and ability to achieve growth in excess of £2 million turnover.  In addition, the dynamic contribution to job creation seen for the first time from some of the State companies will continue to be fostered and supported.  Ambitious investments in companies, such as Top Tech and TEAM Aer Lingus, are role models for other joint-venture developments within this sector of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Small business is also a vigorous part of the industry scene.  Over one-third of the sustainable new jobs in the last three years were created by small firms, which supply £3.5 billion worth of goods to overseas companies in Ireland.  The renewal of the business expansion scheme, now firmly focused on the smaller company needing equity finance, will contribute to fostering and nourishing the spirit of enterprise, which is critical to achieving a regional spread in our job-creation work.</P>
    <P>The construction industry has also shown strong growth over the last two years, leading to a substantial increase in employment.  The number at work in the sector should be about 10,000 higher this year than in 1987.</P>
    <P>New industrial investment, growth in tourism, the revival of the housing sector with the highest level of completions since 1983, urban renewal, and increased Structural Funds which have allowed a 5 per cent increase in the public capital programme affecting the building industry in 1991, are all contributing to a much more healthy building industry as well as the maintenance of a climate of confidence in a sound economy.  The budget <Col N="2032" /> also contains measures to boost the voluntary housing sector, and retains &ldquo;section 23&rdquo; relief for one final year. Predictions last year, however, that there might be an overheating in the construction industry fuelled by the Structural Funds, have proved groundless.</P>
    <P>Tourism has enjoyed four successful years in a row, with growth rates of between 12 and 15 per cent far in excess of the international average, fully justifying our decision in 1987 to give tourism a much higher Government priority. We aim to create an additional 15,000 tourist-related jobs by 1993.  It is one area in which heavy new investment has been in progress since 1987, which will continue through to the end of 1993 with the help of Structural Fund assistance. However, given that tourism is one of the sectors that could be adversely affected by the Gulf War, an extra £1 million has been provided for marketing promotion by Bord Fáilte in the budget, into markets such as continental Europe that have performed strongly in the last four years, with a doubling of the number of visitors.</P>
    <P>Two other areas that have shown considerable growth potential are the marine and forestry.  Employment in the fishing industry is set to increase by a further 3,000 over the next three years.  Forestry planting has almost doubled to nearly 20,000 hectares in 1990, mainly due to a huge increase in private sector planting, and will be increased to a level of 30,000 hectares by 1991.</P>
    <P>I think everybody knows that our farmers are having a difficult time.  In nominal terms, income fell by some 5 per cent or so last year.  When account is taken of inflation and the net interest position, the real drop was well in excess of that figure, but it must be pointed out that that was a reduction from a relatively high plateau in 1989 when incomes in farming, in nominal terms, were 51 per cent higher than in 1986.  Farm incomes therefore in 1990 are still about 28 per cent above the 1986 level.  In the difficult circumstances prevailing since last summer, the Government sought to limit the fall in farm incomes by obtaining increased EC intervention purchases, <Col N="2033" /> and through earlier payment of headage grants.</P>
    <P>The new programme recognises the central importance of agriculture to the Irish economy and the need to maximise its contribution.  While the protection of the livelihood of farmers must to a great extent be negotiated at EC level, a number of specific measures agreed to in the programme are being implemented in the budget, including the bringing forward to 1991 of the increase in headage rates scheduled for 1992.</P>
    <P>Farmers, of course, do not live apart from the rest of the community.  From the point of view of their farms as business enterprises, they will benefit from overall economic improvement and, in particular, from low inflation and interest rates.  Farm families will benefit too, with other families, from the improvements in the budget and the programme in education, health, community care and social welfare.</P>
    <P>An essential component of the new programme is a firm commitment to the future growth and development of our agriculture industry and the prosperity of our farmers.  In my view, both of these are necessary not only in the interest of keeping an equitable balance in our society but in the overall national interest also.  Agricultural output and the food industry make a massive contribution to the economy, both domestically and externally.  Of equal importance is the need to maintain a viable and vibrant rural population based on the family farm as part of our basic social structure.  It is also important for the preservation of the countryside and our natural environment. Deputies will be interested to know that in the course of a conversation recently among European leaders, I found that there is a fairly widespread commitment to this concept and agreement that it must be a key element in any reshaping of European agriculture.</P>
    <P>A major debate is now under way on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, and the EC Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, has been outlining radical reform proposals, which involve a <Col N="2034" /> considerable switch from farm price support to income support, concentrated on the smaller and less intensive farmer.  The philosophy behind these reforms is that substantial reductions in Community support will be inevitable over the foreseeable future and that, in those circumstances, small scale producers will have to be protected.  The objective is to maintain the fabric of rural society by helping retain the maximum number of families on the land.  We have no problem with the philosophy, indeed we welcome it, but how it is to be implemented could create significant difficulties for us.  Our task will be to ensure that there is no damage to the vital interests of Irish agriculture as a modern viable commercial industry.</P>
    <P>In adapting the Common Agricultural Policy, we will be insisting that smaller scale producers receive adequate protection, going beyond socio-structural aid and built into the market mechanism.  The right balance has to be struck.  The future development of rural society and of a competitive food industry demands the continued viability and participation of the modern and progressive commercial farmers, whose contribution is vitally important to us.  The Community must ensure that competition and efficient commercial farming on a reasonable scale is not undermined in the policy changes which will eventually emerge. Therefore, we will be insisting that full account must be taken of the diversity of Community agriculture and of economies like ours, particularly dependent on agriculture, and that adequate, Community-funded compensation for producers and regions adversely affected is provided, in whatever proposals emerge from the Commission on Common Agricultural Policy reform and on the Community's response to the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>One major long term objective of tax policy must be that Ireland has a fully competitive tax system compared to other countries in relation to all key areas of taxation.  This must be accompanied by the creation of equity throughout the entire taxation system.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to tax reform is being <Col N="2035" /> pursued.  Tax reform to most people means tax rate reductions.  We have accepted for some years now that rates of taxation in our main revenue-earning taxes &mdash; Income Tax, VAT and excise duties &mdash; are generally too high.  We have begun adjusting them and in the process have put many hundreds of millions of pounds back into taxpayers' pockets: £800 million in income tax alone over the past few years.  This is right both from the viewpoint of the domestic incentive to effort and the onset of the European Single Market in 1992.  The resources generated through taxation are not excessive by international standards.  It is the way the burden is structured that gives rise to concern.  Accordingly, we have committed ourselves to a programme of major &mdash; even radical &mdash; reform of the structure of taxation, which is continuing in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, breaking the trend of more than 20 years, the burden of taxation, both direct and indirect, has been substantially reduced.  In the area of income tax, the changes made have exempted many thousands of taxpayers from any liability.  Through broadening the bands, especially in 1988, the proportion of taxpayers on the standard rate has been brought to over 60 per cent. The standard rate of tax and the top rate have been progressively reduced.  In three budgets, six points have been taken off each.  The important thing is that progress towards the objective of a 25 per cent standard rate and a single higher rate of tax is continuing to be made, despite the difficult conditions facing us this year.</P>
    <P>This budget continues to give effect to our policy of steadily improving the position of the lower paid.  The exemption limits and the allowance for the third and subsequent child have been raised. Significant improvements in the family income supplemement, the special minimum wage increase in the new programme draft pay agreement, and the extension of PRSI to part-time workers are all part of a consistent approach to helping this section of our society, whose <Col N="2036" /> situation requires special priority treatment. These changes for the benefit of those whose family situation is particularly difficult are also reflected in the new provision for persons bereaved and the extension of the PAYE allowance to persons living on this side of the Border and working on the other side.</P>
    <P>The tax base has been substantially broadened in this budget.  The business expansion scheme is being redirected.  The business expansion scheme has served a purpose of stimulating investment and employment, but its cost is high, and we could not afford the rising costs of the scheme if we were to take further action this year to reduce the main rates of income tax.  I just could not afford to bring in these improvements in the rates of income tax and at the same time bear the increasing costs arising from the business expansion scheme. There will, undoubtedly, be grounds for complaint that this or that valuable scheme providing employment will not now be able to go ahead or that the sudden cutoff point is unfair to individuals, and these we understand.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the dedication, professionalism and integrity of officials of the Department of Finance.  These qualities and the range of modern skills which they can deploy in support of the Government's efforts to transform the Irish economy have been of crucial importance in everything that has been achieved.  Their performance during the Irish Presidency and in the ongoing EC negotiations has been superb.  The Government have not been and are not now prepared to engage in irresponsible tax cutting of the type that caused major disruption in the British economy, while postponing the elimination of the current budget deficit indefinitely.  The budget is decided and produced by the Government, and any criticism or complaints about it should be politically directed at the Government in accordance with the best traditions of our parliamentary democracy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always been cautious about the notion of radical tax reform involving as it must enormous short term disruption of personal finances and of borrowings made on the assumption of a reasonably stable tax system. To keep on bleating about some vague unspecified &ldquo;tax reform&rdquo; while ignoring what is actually happening is not very honest.  The truth is that real tax reform has been taking place at an unprecedented rate in recent years and is continuing apace.</P>
      <P>There has been a vast improvement in the tax administration system also in recent years.  The introduction of self-assessment procedures has undoubtedly, for self-employed individuals in 1988 and for companies in 1989, been very successful from every point of view, including a very satisfactory increase in revenue.  A scheme of self-assessment has now been extended to capital acquisitions tax with effect from September 1989. Self-assessment has greatly improved the efficiency of the tax system and simplified its operation for taxpayers and their advisers by bringing greater certainty into their tax affairs and eliminating long delays in finalising taxpayers' liabilities which were such a diverse feature of the old system.  It ensures that more resources are available to pursue those remaining outside the tax net.</P>
      <P>The Government have also very substantially increased the yields from capital taxes and from corporation tax, the rates of which have been simplified and rationalised.  Whereas the yield from capital taxes only increased by £13 million in the four years to 1986, they are projected to increase by £16 million alone this year, and the total 1991 yield of £87 million is well over double the 1986 yield of £34 million.  The increase in yield has come, it should be noted, not from punitive increases in the rates of capital tax as advocated in some quarters, but from the creation of more wealth in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in corporation tax is even <Col N="2038" /> more substantial.  The reduction of the standard rate and the broadening of the base over recent budgets, including the reduction of accelerated capital allowances, and the restrictions this year on section 84 lending are leading to a significant increase in the yield from corporation tax.  In the four years to 1986 inclusive, corporation tax increased by a mere £26 million.  Since 1986, the increase has been ten times that amount, with an increase of £270 million since that date.  As a result, the total yield will have more than doubled to £527 million in 1991 compared with £258 million five years ago.  Again, these results have come from important reforms coupled with greatly increased industrial and commercial activity, rather than from the imposition of penal measures or a breach of faith with overseas investors who have been promised long term tax stability, which some have urged.</P>
    <P>The changes in VAT rates are designed to align ourselves progressively with our European partners in preparation for the Single Market.  There has now been a 4 per cent reduction in the standard rate to 21 per cent.  While it was necessary to increase the lower 10 per cent rate to 12.5 per cent, sensitive sectors of the economy from the employment point of view, such as tourism, construction and newspapers, have been left out and remain at 10 per cent, until such time as harmonisation requires further change.  The VAT changes represent a net cost to the Exchequer of £37 million.  That is what I pointed out here on budget night.  The combined effect of the changes in the VAT rate is to give £37 million back to our consumers.  Indeed, most people will benefit from these indirect tax changes, with the possible exception of the heavy smoker, with due apologies to Deputy Brendan McGahon.</P>
    <P>For the second year running, there has been no increase in the excise duties on drink and petrol.  Indeed, VAT on both drink and petrol has been reduced, resulting in a fall of 5p in the price of a gallon of petrol from 1 March and a 3p fall in the price of a pint.  It is a long time since any Minister reduced the price of <Col N="2039" /> the pint, and it astonishes me that there have not been more excited, congratulatory and even ecstatic comments about that aspect of the budget.  The price of new cars also will come down and many household goods will be favourably affected &mdash; electrical goods, soaps, detergents, household furnishings, kitchen utensils, etc.  Items required by children, particularly school children, will all be reduced in price.  These reductions will benefit not only the consumer but important sections of industry as well, and the cost of professional services will be reduced.</P>
    <P>One of the prime objectives of the budget was to give priority, as always, to improving the circumstances of the less well-off and disadvantaged, and to begin work on the comprehensive and ambitious social agenda of the new programme. The clear thrust of this budget is progressive and redistributive.  The fruits of economic growth must be shared.</P>
    <P>The general increase of 4 per cent in social welfare rates, in line with this year's wage and salaries increases under the programme, is 1 per cent above the projected rate of inflation and to that extent is an improvement in real terms. All categories of social welfare recipient, pensioners, widows, the long term unemployed, and the handicapped are, therefore, receiving real increases in benefit. As in previous years, those on the lowest rates are receiving increases over and above the general rate.  The long term unemployment rate is increased by almost 6 per cent.  The lowest payments, short term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, are up by 11 per cent to a minimum of £50 a week.  Adult dependant allowances for the unemployed are increased by 6.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> sets out a timetable for fulfilling the priority requirements of the Commission on Social Welfare.  That is our basic long term approach to the social welfare rates.</P>
    <P>Families, especially those on low <Col N="2040" /> incomes, are our continuing and special priority in both the income tax and social welfare codes.  As I have pointed out, there will be substantial improvements for families from the increases in the income tax exemption limits, and the family income supplement.  In addition, the higher rate of child benefit is now being extended to the fourth child, having been given to the fifth child last year. Child dependant allowances are being raised by up to 9 per cent, and are being continued up to age 21 for children in full-time education.  Other measures for deprived families are the allocation of 60 extra teachers to schools in disadvantaged areas and a repeat of the £0.5 million allocated by the Minister for Social Welfare to women's groups in last year's budget.</P>
    <P>An important and significant social reform is the extension of social insurance and corresponding benefits to part-time workers, most of whom at present are women excluded from social insurance cover.  We are in the process of creating one of the most progressive systems of protection for part-time workers in Europe.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has a broad and comprehensive social agenda.  Significant steps are being taken in this budget to implement important parts of that agenda and commitments that we have entered into.</P>
    <P>Action to deal in a real way with the scourge of long term unemployment spans the ground between employment and social policy.  A major new initiative in dealing with the problem of long term unemployment is included in the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and will be implemented quickly following the ratification of that programme.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this new initiative will be undertaken, first of all, at local level by a new, more effective and co-ordinated partnership between the local community, including employers, trade unions and farmers, and the official development agencies both national and local, and in addition, at the national <Col N="2041" /> level by the involvement and supervision of the Central Review Committee which will recommend appropriate arrangements to Governments to bind together the local community interests and all the public agencies concerned in each participating area.</P>
    <P>This is a new departure bringing a much more intensive approach based on recommendations by the NESC in its recent report <i>A Strategy for the Nineties.</i> What is now envisaged is welding all these agencies together and linking them up with the local community groups who have done much work in these areas, so that there will a single combined attack on long term unemployment and all the deprivation which flows from it in these areas.  By combining resources in this way and by involving local communities in the planning and delivery of area based projects, the more specific local needs and priorities will be recogised and met.</P>
    <P>A primary focus of the new strategy will be to improve the education and skills in these communities.  A major cause of long term unemployment is educational deprivation.  Special measures will be taken to improve education and skills throughout these areas, particularly among young people who need a second chance in education or an opportunity to acquire appropriate qualifications in the skills now in demand in all labour markets. We must ensure that employers and trade unions in the areas are involved, so that training and education can be directed to producing the skills required for the jobs likely to arise in these particular areas.  It is very important to relate the jobs that we will create in any particular area to the needs that will arise in that area and to the sorts of jobs that are likely to arise, in other words, to match the two.  The objectives will also include community development in its widest sense, so that all resources are mobilised within these areas to change fundamentally the corrosive patterns of deprivation which exist in them and contribute directly to long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>At national level, the Central Review <Col N="2042" /> Committee, including all the social partners and also representatives from combat poverty, The Irish Resource Development Trust and the Trust for Community Initiatives, will meet as soon as the programme has been ratified and will recommend to Government the specific organisational requirements for this new strategy and for the pilot areas which will be selected to be implemented in 1991.</P>
    <P>The new approach will be piloted in both rural and urban areas this year on the basis of the provision of £0.5 million in this year's budget to cover the managerial costs of the local companies to be established.  The relevant public agencies will implement the specific measures of the new strategy in the pilot areas with appropriate funds from their budgets and with new assistance from a number of European funds.  Satisfactory models will be progressively extended nationwide by 1994, as resources become available from a growing economy.  I am quite optimistic that this new approach will succeed and I hope Deputies will play a supportive role in their own areas.  I would like to recommend it to Deputies on all sides of the House and seek their full support for it in local areas, in their constituencies.</P>
    <P>Before I come to the improvements in the budget and the programme related to health and education, I would like to clear up a serious misrepresentation of the real level of Government expenditure in relation to these key elements of the social services.  Health expenditure in 1991 will be about 6 per cent ahead in real constant price terms of its 1986 level. Between 1986 and 1990 education spending increased in real terms by over 13 per cent.  In other words &mdash; in spite of all that has been said &mdash; there have been no lasting cuts in the overall health and education budgets.  Indeed, resources either have been, or are being, increased in both areas.  In response to a greater deal being said at present about the health budgets for 1991, that fact should be borne in mind, that they are actually 6 per cent higher in real terms &mdash; not just in money terms &mdash; than they were. Somehow that dilemma has to be sorted <Col N="2043" /> out.  Why is it that there are such complaints from health boards and others when, in fact, in real terms, budgets have been increased by 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>A high quality of education for all children and young people is increasingly being seen worldwide as the key to a country's future development.  Research has estabished that it is a major factor in competitiveness of any country's economy. The Irish education system, relative to its resources, is excellent.  The objective of the new programme is to make it even better by introducing major educational improvements &mdash; the lowering of the pupil-teacher ratio at primary and second levels, the reintroduction of clerical and secretarial assistance in national schools and of vice-principals and guidance teachers in post-primary schools, the upgrading and replacement of buildings, the tackling of disadvantage, the phasing in of a six-year post-primary cycle and the expansion of third-level places.  The extra resources that will be involved represent one of the best investments we can posssibly make in our future.  We have made a start in this year's budget.  I have said already that education is the key.  Certainly in this new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we have given effect to that principle.</P>
    <P>From June, we will be providing free access to hospital consultant services for the entire population.  That completes the process of extending access to hospitals which I started as Minister for Health in 1979, when I gave free access for all to hospital beds.  This is designed, in accordance with the programme particularly to ensure equity of access to hospital services. The Government remain committed to the maintenance of private practice inside and outside of hospitals, and to supporting the vital role played by the VHI, payments to which will continue to receive full income tax relief.</P>
    <P>An additional £8 million is being provided to health boards for community health services in 1991, to assist older and handicapped people to live in their own community, and not in institutions.  One <Col N="2044" /> Fine Gael Deputy last evening &mdash; I think it was Deputy Boylan &mdash; spoke about that very specific matter, about the problem of an old person in a hospital who could no longer remain there and had to be sent home.  This is precisely what we are tackling in a major way in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> We are starting this year by providing an extra £8 million for community care. Dental services will be improved also and we will provide the particular services and facilities required under the provisions of the new child care legislation. The carer's allowance has been increased from £45 to £50.  It has now been extended to carers of people in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance. In addition, £500,000 are being provided to assist voluntary and community organisations.  Those are a number of initiatives outlined in the programme and referred to in the budget to encourage the provision of social housing and to tackle the problem of homelessness at a total cost of almost £10 million.  We have no intention of allowing this social problem to grow to the proportions it has assumed in many other more developed countries.</P>
    <P>Concern for our environment permeates all the policies and actions of this Government.  Last year, the Government launched an ambitious £1 billion environment action programme to secure a high quality environment to protect the health, safety and well-being of this and future generations.  In fact, we will shortly be carrying out a review of progress in that programme, to date.</P>
    <P>Environmentally friendly aspects of the budget include higher road tax increases for larger cars, the reduction in excise duty on auto LPG, and the combination of the 50 per cent rate of accelerated allowances to help combat farmyard pollution.  In addition, half a million pounds has been provided to assist the restoration of heritage buildings, which are open to the public, on the advice of the National Heritage Council. The restoration of architecturally important buildings in urban designated areas is an equally valuable step.  For the first <Col N="2045" /> time the refurbishment costs of these buildings can now be offset against all rental income.</P>
    <P>We should be very satisfied, in today's international conditions, that it has been possible to bring in a positive budget, one which enables us to continue the progress of the last few years and to start significant new initiatives agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The budget has been generally welcomed outside the House.  It has been recognised as right in present circumstances. Business and financial confidence has been fully maintained.  There is tax reform and real social progress. Our strategy for increasing employment and living standards is in place.  We are meeting the challenges of the nineties fortified by a national consensus.</P>
    <P>We may not have been able on this occasion to do all that we would have wished to do in the social area, but we have been fair and balanced in our approach and taken the careful and prudent approach demanded by present circumstances in the best long term interest of all the people.</P>
    <P>We, the Irish people, must make our way in increasingly difficult world conditions. We can make no better response to those conditions than by creating economic stability at home.  This year's budget, and the longer term framework provided by the new programme, lay the groundwork for doing this.</P>
    <P>We know there are difficulties to be faced in the world market-place.  We must not be intimidated by these difficulties. There is a huge potential there as well.  Our people are better equipped than ever before to exploit that potential. By working together we can build up and strengthen our economy and our society. This is the only way, ultimately, that we can help and encourage the unemployed, the deprived and the disadvantaged in our society, and create a better standard of living for all the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has spent the last 70 minutes gilding the lily in the most outrageous fashion.  He has been <Col N="2046" /> laying on the gilt not just with a trowel but with a shovel and it is about time he realised that.  The Taoiseach went as far as repeating the nonsensical guff about farm incomes in 1990, recently retreated from by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  It is time to get back to reality.</P>
      <P>There are two major fundamental flaws in this budget.  The first is that it is based on the expectation that there will be growth in output and real GNP this year of 2¼ per cent.  That expectation is clearly central to the revenue figures set out in the budget.  I am not yet sure whether the last minute change in the provision for unemployment assistance marks a departure from that expectation. It may well.  The Government now seem to be the only actor on the national stage who believe in the projection of 2¼ per cent growth.  The Taoiseach thinks that the Government's projection of 2¼ per cent falls comfortably within the range of projections of between 1½ per cent and 2½ per cent that are being made.  I have news for the Taoiseach.  That 2½ per cent at the top of the range is very far fetched and the Taoiseach's 2¼ per cent is not much less far fetched.  I suspect that the projection of 2¼ per cent has been chosen for political reasons because it suits the culture the Government are trying to cultivate. It suits the propaganda they are trying to get across.  Large sections of the media have swallowed the propaganda and are now promoting the culture in spite of the fact that their colleagues in other sections constantly bring before them evidence to the effect that things are not as they are presented to be.  All the other experts and commentators have lower expectations of growth, sometimes substantially lower expectations.  If they turn out to be right, as I believe they will, the Government will quickly find that their budget arithmetic is getting seriously out of kilter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second flaw lies in the underlying trend in the current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement as they were set out by the Minister in his budget speech.  The Minister indicated that the current deficit for 1990 turned out at £152 million.  His forecast for 1991 <Col N="2047" /> is £245 million.  That in itself is a substantial increase in circumstances where, if we were to believe the Minister's rhetoric over the last three years, we should see a reduction rather than an increase, in the current deficit.  The outturn for the Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1990 was £462 million and the Minister is forecasting a figure of £460 million for this year.  When we look behind the figures we get a clearer picture.  A sum of £52 million due to the Government here from the European Social Fund was held up in the works towards the end of last year.  It is expected apparently that that money will come in during the course of this year.  Had that delay not happened last year the current deficit for 1990 would have been £100 million and the Exchequer borrowing requirement would have been £410 million.  Equally, had that delay not happened last year, the current deficit for this year would be £297 million and the Exchequer borrowing requirement would have been £512 million.  The real underlying picture is that the current budget deficit for 1991 would be three times what it was in 1990 &mdash; £290 million instead of £100 million and the Exchequer borrowing requirement would be £100 million more in 1991 than it was in 1990.  That is the real underlying trend in those two major budgetary aggregates.  The trends are going in the wrong way and no amount of lily gilding by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance can alter that.</P>
    <P>Those two factors in themselves &mdash; the inflated expectation of growth and the unreal picture presented by the Minister's figures for a current deficit and Exchequer borrowing requirement &mdash; cast doubt on the overall architecture of this budget.</P>
    <P>The growth projection is clearly the key to the projections of revenue and receipts.  Looking at the figures, we find that non-capital receipts are projected to increase by 6.3 per cent in 1990 and capital receipts are expected to double.  The total increase in receipts is projected at 9.7 per cent.  That gives a real increase in receipts of 3.2 per cent for non-capital, <Col N="2048" /> 95 per cent for capital receipts and 6.5 per cent overall.  If the growth in the economy falls short of the Government's assumptions, these levels of receipts will be in danger and the outturn in terms of the current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement will exceed the levels now being projected by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The picture is no brighter on the expenditure side.  Looking at the pre-budget projections of expenditure for 1991 presented to this House by the Government last week, we find an overall increase of 6.7 per cent in non-capital expenditure.  This means a real increase of 3.6 per cent in Government current spending, if we are to believe the inflation figure projected by the Government.</P>
    <P>The total increase in expenditure on debt service and other Central Fund charges is 7.4 per cent in current money terms, or 4.3 per cent in real terms.  The increase in expenditure on non-capital supply services is 6.4 per cent in current terms, or 3.3 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>Thus, we see that instead of there being any curb on the volume of public expenditure, as the Taoiseach tried to indicate and as the Minister's rhetoric over the last three years would seem to be designed to make us believe, there is, in fact, an increase in the volume of Government activity in terms of current expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Government, who are presenting themselves at every opportunity as having expenditure under control, are again this year projecting real increases in the volume of public expenditure and trying to hide the fact that in the process they are increasing the current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  That is important in terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; PESP, as it is now being called.</P>
    <P>Looking at capital expenditure, we see an increase of 27.3 per cent in current money terms or 23.6 per cent in real terms.  The biggest single increase here is in relation to capital issues under various statutes, where there is an increase of 182 per cent in current money terms or 174 per cent in real terms.  Here again, there <Col N="2049" /> is no evidence whatever of the Government's taking the rhetoric of the Minister for Finance in any way seriously.  The Taoiseach referred in his speech to his expectation that there will be a volume growth of 3 per cent in investment this year and he referred to the fact that some of the capital expenditure provisions had to be increased in order to allow us to draw down money from the Community Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>I recently carried out a brief review of the prospects for investment in the major areas in the coming year to try to decide how successful we would be in drawing down Community Structural Funds. There was only one area where I could feel confident that we would use up all the Structural Funds that would come onstream.  That was in the specific area of industrial development, not in infrastructure where programmes are years behind, not in agriculture where I have very little confidence that there will be the response in terms of investment, given the income situation.  Maybe there will be the kind of response we need in our food processing industry because it needs constantly to update its technology. In the other areas I cannot see any real grounds for expecting the kind of investment activity this year that would give us a 3 per cent volume increase in investment in the economy.</P>
    <P>There are 19 separate tax measures in the budget and one would think that the devil and all was being done in terms of tax reform.  That is not the case.  Twelve of these tax measures work out, on the face of it, to the benefit of taxpayers in general.  The remaining seven represent new impositions of one kind or another. We have to ask ourselves what the net effect is of this complex of 19 separate measures.</P>
    <P>Let us look at tax relief first.  On the face of it, the measures cover a wide range.  They include the increase in personal allowances &mdash; £50 for a single person or £100 for a married couple.  It is not worthwhile to give the Revenue Commissioners the extra work of doing that.  The widening of the standard rate band by £200 for a single person or £400 <Col N="2050" /> for a married couple will cost more to administer than it will bring in and the ordinary taxpayer will not notice the effect.  There are the extension of capital allowances for farm pollution control, the renewal and extension of section 23 relief, so beloved of Fianna Fáil, miscellaneous reliefs, the reduction of the 23 per cent VAT rate to 21 per cent, miscellaneous excise reductions and minor reliefs on capital taxes.  Together these measures come to a grand total of £175 million in 1991.  Ten tax measures produce a mere £175 million.  If we add in the effect of the increase in the general and age tax exemption limits &mdash; £150 for a single person or £300 for a married couple &mdash; and the increase of £200 for the third and subsequent children, as well as the reduction in the marginal income tax relief rate, we get a grand total of £183.6 million worth of tax reliefs.  I wonder what proportion of people claiming the child exemption have three or more children.</P>
    <P>Now let us look at the tax impositions. There are the reduction in life assurance relief, the BES restrictions, the increase in the 10 per cent VAT rate to 12.5 per cent, the increase in road tax rates, the increase in excise duties on cigarettes and tobacco, which I personally will have the honour of paying, the introduction of self-assessment for capital gains tax, which I will not have the honour of paying this year, and the introduction of a capital acqusitions tax amnesty, from which I will not benefit.  Taken together, they increase tax revenue by £134.3 million. So far we have tax reliefs of £183.6 million and new impositions of £134.3 million.  The figures are getting very close.</P>
    <P>Two other measures are hidden in the explanatory table under the apparently innocuous heading of &ldquo;Net Revisions to Estimates&rdquo;.  There we find in the footnote that this includes £10 million receipt arising from the abolition of the health contributions ceiling and the extension of PRSI to part-time workers.  These are two measures we must look at to determine the total effect of the taxation measures on the ordinary person.  When <Col N="2051" /> we take all these into account we find that the net effect of the budget on the taxation of ordinary people is to relieve taxation by the miserly sum of £39.3 million.  All that fire and thunder &mdash; 19 tax measures in the budget &mdash; to produce a net hand back to taxpayers of £39.3 million.  The mountain laboured mightily and produced a mouse.  Let the Minister not tell us that this plethora of measures which has to be gone through to arrive at the figure of £39.3 million makes any substantial change in the balance or equity of our tax system.  Each of them is far too small to have any effect.  Taken altogether, they are too mean and too miserly to make the slightest difference to the ordinary taxpayer.  All it means is that Irish taxpayers will end up paying more tax this year than last year despite all the posturing by the Minister and despite all his claims to be giving something back.  They will pay this extra tax under a system that has not been reformed in any real way, but has been tinkered with around the edges.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach tried to defend some of that and he tried to find a little bit in it that would take some of the badness out of it.  On VAT and trying to soften the impact of the VAT, his script read: &ldquo;Items required by children, school notebooks and satchels, toys, soft drinks, sweets and biscuits will all be reduced in price&rdquo;.  This is the sweetner for these changes in VAT.  I wonder if the Taoiseach remembers the simple fact that people who are involved in the ordinary day-to-day business of raising children, getting them up in the morning, giving them their lunch, getting them out to school and looking after all the other things they need, will very quickly tell you that school notebooks and satchels, toys, soft drinks, sweets and biscuits are very marginal to their main concerns about the costs and burdens of raising children.  I find it very amusing because I read that text which the Taoiseach was kind enough to distribute to us before he started.  Even the Taoiseach himself was so embarrassed by the vacuity of that statement that he did not read it out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2052" /> That is eloquent comment on what that will mean for taxpayers raising children in this country.  No wonder that the Progressive Democrats' chairman in exile and spokesman in the wilderness has most recently been even more virulent than ever about the &ldquo;temporary little arrangement&rdquo; of having Deputy Reynolds as Minister for Finance.  As far as tax reform is concerned this year the Progressive Democrats huffed and puffed and blew themselves out of the water.</P>

      <P>The only expenditure provisions of this budget that give anything back to ordinary people are the much vaunted social welfare improvements.  These amount to £62 million in 1991.  In the context of this budget, this must be the smallest provision made for many years.</P>

      <P>I want to give one example. I spoke to a constituent of mine last Thursday, an old age pensioner who uses kerosene for heating and cooking.  I will give the example very summarily.  His pension will increase by £90 in 1991 and <Col N="2053" /> his fuel bill, with the addition of the value-added tax, will increase by £417.50. This budget has done absolutely nothing for him.  If we add that £62 million to the miserly £39.3 million handed back in tax we will find that the Irish population have been given £101.3 million and that is the total measure of the munificence of this Government faced as it is by intractable problems of unemployment and the growing problems of poverty.  So much for caring, for understanding or for even the slightest comprehension of what is happening in Irish society.</P>
      <P>It could have been very different.  Over the past three years my party have made a series of proposals providing for real reforms in our tax system, a restructuring and greater efficiency in our health service, a fundamental reorganisation of our social insurance payments scheme and a much more creative and employment-friendly approach to social welfare.</P>

      <P>Only two weeks ago, a very coherent and thought-provoking proposal for a budget was put forward by the Reverend Sean Healy of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.  On reflection, I suppose, even on mature reflection, we should have seen that that proposal had very little chance of getting any consideration from a Taoiseach who is on record in this House as distrusting organisations that use the words &ldquo;major&rdquo; and &ldquo;superior&rdquo; in their titles.  The Taoiseach's hubris, apparently, is such that he thinks those terms must be exclusively reserved to himself.  Any chance that the Reverend Sean Healy's proposal might have had after that was further jeopardised when the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, described the author &mdash; and I quote his exact words &mdash; as a man who would &ldquo;still be complaining when he gets to heaven&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I must say it is a pity that the Minister and the Government are not able to count as closely as the Deputy. They might have got their sums right.  It is nice to know that I am under benevolent scrutiny from the other side; and I will come to a conclusion.  The point I want to make is that a very large proportion of this budget was decided outside of this House by groups of people who are not democratically representative.  I do not criticise the people who negotiated with the Government; I criticise the Government for having capitulated.</P>
      <P>I look back to 1987 &mdash; and I will conclude on this, Sir &mdash; at what Deputy O'Malley then had to say about the predecessor of this programme, the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> He rightly castigated the job targets.  The new programme has even more ambitious job targets.  He called them myths back in 1987.  He rightly castigated the expenditure commitments contained in them and he came to this conclusion: &ldquo;I am afraid the leopard does not really change its spots.  This Government's wilful throwing away of all they gained in recent months underlines again the daftness of giving such an administration a blank cheque&rdquo;.  He was right.  The leopard does not change his spots; but then, Deputy O'Malley is no leopard.  He is a submissive and compliant pussy cat.</P>

      <P>This budget is scarcely eight days old and already it is becoming increasingly difficult to find anything new to say about it.  Indeed, it is only fair to remind ourselves of the atmosphere in which the budget was framed, an atmosphere of extreme uncertainty arising out of the gathering gloom in the Gulf and the ever deepening recession in the United Kingdom and on the continent of North America. When the EC demands of tax harmonisation are added to this climate of unpredictability, it then becomes both unfair and unreasonable to have expected a major radical budget in the year that is in it.  At times like this responsible Governments seek to consolidate existing gains, batten down the hatches and opt for stability.  That is what was done in the budget of 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Progressive Democrats are disappointed.  We argued for more extensive tax reductions and more accelerated tax reform.  We wanted to see a comprehensive reform of PRSI in this calendar year, but we have to be ruthlessly realistic.  In all the circumstances, we have to settle for the slower pace that the delicate balance of today's events and tomorrow's uncertainties dictate.  Is it not significant that we are now regretting the pace of reform, not the absence of reform, as we did in the eighties? <Col N="2057" /> One thing I find hard to settle for, however, is the antics and semantics of the main Opposition party in their reaction to this budget.  Traditionally times of international difficulties have been times of constructive Opposition and have been times of a basic consensus at home.  This consensus seems to be remarkably absent these days.  I was particularly struck by the extraordinary comments of the present Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy John Bruton on the budget debate on Thursday last.  In the course of his comments he made a bitter attack on the Progressive Democrats Party and proceeded to predict in his own inimitable fashion a rapid demise for our party.  I was reminded of another day in the interesting history of Fine Gael in March 1987 when the then new Leader, the previous speaker Deputy Alan Dukes, was chaired shoulder high from this House to Kildare Street where he gave an impromptu press conference in the course of which he predicted that the Progressive Democrats Party would be gone in one year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is some nerve coming from a man who holds the unique distinction of being the only politician in the history of Irish political life who on two occasions, failed to bring a successful budget before this House.</P>
      <P>I wonder what the Irish electorate, who have a fairly long memory, think of his utterances in this budget debate.  Let me briefly remind them of Deputy Bruton's pitiful record in Government by referring to the economic misery this country suffered in 1985 the mid-term point of his time in office.  In 1985 the Irish economy was in utter despair, unemployment and emigration shot up, manufacturing jobs were lost at the rate of 6,000 per year, the Exchequer borrowing requirement reached a record high of 12.9 per cent, average industrial earnings were falling by up to 10 per cent a year, moneys flowed out of this country into the infamous black hole and total confidence in the Irish economy both at home and abroad collapsed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Today the contrast with those depressing years, could scarcely be greater.  Confidence has now been restored in the Irish economy both at <Col N="2060" /> home and abroad and much of that economic recovery owes its origin and momentum directly to the policies of the Progressive Democrats and to our contribution to Government.  When Deputy Bruton was last in Government the top tax rate was 60 per cent, now it is 52 per cent.  At that time the standard rate of tax was 35 per cent, now it is 29 per cent and it is only in the past two years, since the Progressive Democrats came into Government, that our out-of-line VAT rates are being tackled and have now been brought down in two successive budgets from 25 per cent to 21 per cent. Let us not forget that it was Deputy Bruton's Government who brought the standard VAT rate up to the exorbitant figure of 35 per cent, a measure which obviously and inevitably not only crippled industries up and down the country but laid waste our Border regions and in particular, led to a flood of cross-Border shopping.  It is fascinating to compare the situation now with what it was then.  I will not say any more about that unless I am provoked further.</P>
      <P>This year's budget takes a significant step forward in tax reform.  I am satisfied that our presence in Government is playing a crucial role in ensuring that the overall momentum towards reform and towards the achievement of lower rates of personal taxation will be realised.  Irish PAYE taxpayers can now look forward with every degree of confidence that over the next two budgets the standard rate of income tax will be brought down to 25 per cent and that there will be just one higher rate.  Obviously, my party want to see a rate very much lower than the present rate of 48 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another major focus of concern for Progressive Democrats would be the plight of the less well off and the poor in our society.  We are very pleased with the extension of child care benefit in this budget.  We are pleased with the extension of the carer's allowance, even though we would argue for a much more sympathetic system than currently applies. Because of the eligibility limits a number of people who ought to qualify do not <Col N="2061" /> qualify at present.  We will be working towards that end in the course of the next year.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that a number of additional teachers are put into areas of disadvantage in education.  I agree totally with the Taoiseach when he said in the course of his address this morning that education is the real key to getting young people out of poverty traps &mdash; poverty traps into which they were put during the bleak and miserable years of the mid-eighties. In my own city industries such as Fords, Dunlops, the dockyards and a host of other small industries were closed down and no alternative employment was put in their place.  We still have to this very day deep, entrenched pockets of poverty resulting from those closures in those bad years in Irish political life.</P>
    <P>I have first hand experience of this.  No matter how many new jobs we create in Cork city &mdash; and in the past year we have created more new jobs than were created in any given year in the last ten years &mdash; the backlog and the job losses are so great because of the failure to create jobs in the eighties, that even with creating a record number of new jobs we are still only nibbling at the margins of the problem. We still have deep poverty with its consequent economic and social effects in my own city, all of which stems back directly to the miserable years of the mid-eighties.</P>
    <P>However, I am glad to see that significant steps are being taken to come to the assistance of poorer families.  I am pleased to see an increase in the rate of family income supplement and an extension of the eligibility limits for those who wish to apply for that supplement.  A very serious problem must be addressed in regard to the net take home pay of workers on low wages and the income of people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.  We must use stronger measures to ensure, in the years ahead, that we make it rewarding for workers to get up and go out to work. That has not been the case in recent years.  I know of householders living side by side in housing estates in my city where the would-be breadwinner who is at home <Col N="2062" /> and in receipt of unemployment assistance has a better cash take at the end of the week than his next door neighbour who goes out to work and who does not have access to a medical card or a rent reduction or any of the benefits that go with being in receipt of unemployment assistance.  That cannot be allowed to continue because if so it will have a corrosive effect on the work ethic in this country and it will kill off enterprise and the appetite for work.</P>
    <P>In the coming year and in future budgets I will be arguing very strongly for measures that will make it more profitable and more rewarding for people to work and will take away the penalties that go with low paid work in some parts of our city.  However, over all, I am pleased with the measures which have been adopted this year.</P>
    <P>The last point I should like to make relates to the matter of health and health budgeting and the value that we as taxpayers are getting from our budget this year and in recent years.  In general terms it is fair to say that health has become the Achille's heel of almost every Government in the western world.  We all have direct experience of a steady deterioration in the quality of health services. This has happened despite the fact that year after year additional funding has been made available from central Goverment to health boards.  In the current year £1.426 billion has been made available for the health services.  This is the largest amount of money made available by any Government in Ireland for the health services since the foundation of the State. That includes a sum of £100 million additional to what was provided in the Book of Estimates and a further £8 million in the budget to be targeted at certain community services.</P>
    <P>Despite the allocation of these vast sums of money, the health services are in a state of chaos.  This has led to acute anxiety among patients and families of patients who expect and demand a decent standard of public service.  It is also a cause of acute bafflement to the taxpayers who, year after year, are expected to pay more and more for a health service <Col N="2063" /> that appears to be getting worse.  Clearly, there is some fundamental fault in the administration of the health services.  It is now becoming increasingly evident to everybody that voting additional money at budget time is not the answer.</P>
    <P>This year the Southern Health Board will receive an increased allocation of £6 million; the Mid-Western Health Board will receive an increased allocation of £4 million; and the South Eastern Health Board will receive an increased allocation of £5 million.  Despite that increased allocation there is a steady decrease and decline in the level of service.  I think the time has come for a radical reappraisal of the delivery and the administration of the health services; in other words a radical reappraisal of the health boards. A number of thinking people are now beginning to argue that the boards ought to be abolished altogether and a different system put in their place.  A strong argument could well be made to support that view.  At a minimum I would argue that the composition of the health boards will have to be examined and changed.  It is evident now that, no matter how much taxpayers' money is voted to the health boards, at the end of the day there is no significant improvement in the standard of service.</P>
    <P>If, for example, £100 million were put into education and targeted properly in this financial year, you would see a significant improvement in some area of education.  If £100,000 additional money was put into housing you would see some significant improvement in the area of housing.  When £100 million is put into health what do you find?  You find that the service is getting worse.  I do not think that situation can be tolerated any longer. I said at the outset that the public health services were the Achilles' heel of many Governments in the western world.  My own belief now is that the health services will be the Achilles' heel of this Government and I am giving a warning here this morning that the situation will have to be tackled soon and in a fundamental way. People who expect a reasonable standard of health care are not getting it at present. <Col N="2064" /> Tired taxpayers who are asked to put up more money year after year are not having their expectations met either.  This issue will have to be tackled by the Government in this financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The only factual and honest statement the Taoiseach made in his lengthy address was that the Government are pursuing a policy of fiscal rectitude. I am sorry Deputy Quill has not remained in the House to hear what I have to say about health contributions.  I have never heard a more dishonest or inaccurate appraisal of the financial needs of the health services.  The emphasis placed by the Taoiseach on the Government's efforts to contain public expenditure at a low percentage of GNP means only one thing, that there is a cut in public expenditure.  I want to refer to how this cut in public expenditure affects people.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach went to the country in 1989 he said he had not realised that the cut in expenditure on the health services was having such a detrimental effect.  The Taoiseach has made the same mistake twice.  He has failed to recognise that health board officers have an obligation to provide an adequate and safe level of services.  The current crisis in the health services makes a nonsense of the commitment given by the Government in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to provide a comprehensive, equitable and efficient health care system.  Failure by the Government to honour the commitments in the programme in regard to the health services will cast doubt on the commitments they have made in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chaos in the health services a year ago was blamed on the flu epidemic. There has been no flu epidemic this year but patients still face cutbacks and a seriously reduced level of service.  Several health boards have made it clear that far from moving towards the comprehensive service envisaged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> they are unable, due to a lack of Government funding, to even maintain existing services at their present levels.  This will <Col N="2065" /> mean longer waiting lists, the early discharge of patients, longer closures of wards and beds during holiday periods, a worse plight for the mental handicapped and less money for child care services and facilities for the elderly.</P>
    <P>I want to quote from a letter I received from the President of The Cheshire Foundation in Ireland:</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of the Budget by the Government on the 30th January, there has been a great deal of publicity and comment concerning the needs of people with mental handicaps and their carers.  It is marvellous to see politicians and journalists making an issue about a real problem that has existed for many years.</P>
    <P>However, I am deeply concerned about the lack of notice given to the needs of people with severe physical disability.  The Cheshire Foundation provides residential accommodation for close to 200 people in the seven Cheshire Homes that currently exist in this country.  For every person living in our Homes, there is at least one other seeking a place.  Carers of people with physical disabilities are experiencing the same degree of stress as carers of mentally handicapped people &mdash; some are barely surviving.</P>
    <P>A submission made by a social workers' group to the Southern Health Board indicated that there are no places for people with mental handicaps.  In some cases these are adults who have been maintained at home by elderly parents who have now reached the end of the road. There is no provision made for such people.  The five or six hours per week care assistance provided by the Wheelchair Association to help the parents of mentally handicapped children of one or two years of age is being reduced because the health boards do not have the wherewithal to pay any additional money to the Wheelchair Association to enable them to provide that home care assistance.</P>
    <P>I have asked many times when the recommendations in the report of the Commission on Health Funding will be implemented.  I now find that these <Col N="2066" /> recommendations are being implemented piecemeal.  While I welcome the recommendations on the extension of hospital facilities to all, I cannot understand how any Minister could entertain a request from consultants for an increase in their income to £100,000. It is obscene to entertain such an application at a time when so many of our people are unemployed.</P>
    <P>The number of people eligible to receive a free hospital service was always around 39 per cent but this has now been reduced to 35 per cent.  This means stricter guidelines are being applied in assessing people's eligibility and those who are marginally over the limit are not regarded as eligible.  As I have said previously in the House, no account is taken of the amount of tax and PRSI deducted from the gross income of a person who is marginally over the limit.  This is a scandal which needs to be rectified.  If it is not rectified, people will not get the service to which they are entitled, with the result that many people may die.  That is not an exaggeration.  I have experience of this every other day.  How has the number of eligible people decreased at a time when an increasing number of people are unemployed?  There is something radically wrong with that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals in the programme in regard to the care of the elderly. However, more beds are needed for long stay patients.  The present policy is to use beds which were formerly used for long stay patients as respite beds. Patients' relatives are being asked to sign a document stating that they will take the patient out of hospital when their time is up.  This is creating a lot of stress not only for the elderly but for their families as well.  Many people are now seeking beds in private nursing homes, yet no provision has been made in the budget health allocation to pay the subvention to which nursing homes are entitled under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1989. Demands were made for that subvention but, because no provision has been made for it, the health board of which I am a member will not be able to pay it.</P>
    <P>For the information of the previous <Col N="2067" /> speaker, I should say that the shortfall in expenditure for the Southern Health Board is £4.076 million, plus over-expenditure in 1990 of £2 million.  The board are now requested by the Minister, and his Department officials, to retain the level of service at the December 1989 level.  How can that be done with a lower allocation than is required to meet the increased cost of labour and the increased rate of inflation?  There is no way the board can provide that level of service. Consequently, there will be a reduction in the level of activity in acute hospitals, longer holiday and seasonal closure of beds and an increased range of surgical and medical procedures to be performed on a daily basis.  The Minister referred to this yesterday and said that was what was happening in America but it would not happen here.  That is exactly what is happening and we are not making proper provision for any backup service.  Our public health nurses cannot cope with their present workload let alone cope with people who are discharged early from hospitals.  All that leads to a crisis in our health services.</P>
    <P>The budget allocation for health is like a lottery.  It is based upon the budget of the previous year, or even the year before, rather than on the needs of patients.  I would like to mention a point to which the Minister did not refer.  I find it surprising that the voluntary hospitals do not seem to have the same problems as other hospitals.  They receive their allocation without having to submit any programme or plan for expenditure.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Byrne, covered social welfare very adequately, but I would like to refer to what I see as great anomalies in the social welfare code.  A great number of people on disability benefit do not qualify for other benefits such as free fuel, electricity and so on.  They may be asthmatics but they do not get invalidity pensions.  Some of them have been on disability benefit for eight or ten years and are receiving less than a person on long term unemployment assistance. There is an anomaly there.  People on long term unemployment assistance are <Col N="2068" /> entitled to every penny they get, and more, but the person on disability benefit for a great length of time should be entitled to the same amount.</P>
    <P>There is an archaic system of assessing people who apply for unemployment assistance, and this is driving people out of their homes.  Very often they have to emigrate with not a penny in their pockets.  It is a pity Deputy Quill did not read <i>The Cork Examiner</i> in which there was an article by a returned emigrant who stated that a very high percentage of people from our own city and county of Cork are homeless and hungry on the streets of London.  That is an indictment of Government policy.  It is very well to say the Government are putting their finances in order, but they are kicking out the people for whom there are no jobs leaving the remainder to wallow in unemployment and poverty for as long as they can get away with it.</P>
    <P>On the question of education one welcomes the change in the pupil-teacher ratio, which is not before time, but it will not come until 1992.  As a result of the crazy system which operated over the last number of years the percentage of young people who are illiterate when leaving national schools has increased enormously. The figure of 40,000 has been given &mdash; I stand corrected if I am wrong &mdash; and that is an indictment of our educational system.  There are not enough remedial or career guidance teachers in our schools.  That area of education needs to be addressed if we are to ensure that our young people are not illiterate and are able to cope with the problems of the world.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in the matter of housing.  It has been stated that 20,000 extra houses are needed.  In the area I represent, which accounts for one-third of the county of Cork, 300 people have been on a housing list since 1989, 140 of whom are in urgent need of houses, but only 20 houses were completed in 1990.  There are 700 families without piped water in the same area &mdash; those figures are from the last census &mdash; some of them are elderly people who have to get water from holes in the ground which <Col N="2069" /> may be polluted.  Others use rain water taken from barrels at the rear of their houses.  I demand that something be done about this matter.  A reconstruction grant should also be given to enable people to reconstruct their homes.  The scheme of grants for the elderly is working quite well but it is confined to pensioners.  Widows, and people who are not very elderly, cannot afford to repair or improve their houses.</P>
    <P>On agriculture, organisations like the IFA did no service to their members and the country by suggesting that the course on which the EC have now embarked could be reversed.  The priority must be to set about restructuring Irish agriculture and ensuring that farm supports are given to those who need them most. At present 80 per cent of grant aid is given to 20 per cent of producers, people who run factory farms and do not care a straw whether their neighbours live or die.  Unfortunately successive Irish Governments used the Common Agricultural Policy as a substitute for an effective national farming strategy.  Goods are. produced for which there is no market and as a result the cost to the consumer is increased by up to £15 per week.  Rather than fighting an unwinable battle to preserve Common Agricultural Policy spending at its current level the Government, and farming organisations, should be demanding that any reduction in EC farm support be matched by a compensating increase in EC Structural Funds for Ireland.  Such a development would be of far more benefit to all sectors, including farmers, than the wasteful spending of the CAP.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is vague in terms of job creation in the agriculture and food industry and the development of horticulture. Our future lies in the products we can produce and manufacture.  We must develop what we can control and produce ourselves.  I recently saw a submission from the new farming organisation &mdash; the United Farmers' Association &mdash; which greatly impressed me as they are the only group which seem to be concerned about the plight of small <Col N="2070" /> farmers.  We must seek to maintain a living for people on the land as there is no alternative employment.  However, in order to achieve this a land policy is needed.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to what Deputy Sherlock said in relation to the budget.  I suppose it would be fair to summarise his contribution as one in which he pointed out how far we still have to go.  I do not think that anybody in the House would disagree that there is a long way to go to solve many of the problems facing us.  The point that we on this side of the House, and the Government, would make is that over the past four years there has been a very conscious and committed effort by the Government to try to rectify the serious problems which have recently arisen and indeed which had arisen in the economy over the last ten to 15 years.  I know that the commitment is there and, from the way Deputy Sherlock phrased his speech, it is clear he recognises the fact that progress has been made.  However, he is perfectly right to highlight areas where more progress could &mdash; and should &mdash; be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his contribution earlier on, Deputy Dukes, as he thought, tore Government strategy to pieces.  It followed along the lines of the Fine Gael criticism of this budget, that it was a missed opportunity. I find it easier to accept that kind of criticism from someone like Deputy Sherlock and the party he represents than criticisms from Deputy Dukes who spent four years in Government from 1982 to the end of 1986.  Although he was Minister for Finance he did not introduce a single measure to try to solve our very serious problems.  He, like a number of other Fine Gael speakers, are being dishonest because, although they call for taxes to be cut they are also calling for various measures which would add the <Col N="2071" /> cost to the Exchequer.  Before Christmas they called for the reinstatement of full interest on mortgage relief and they signalled their opposition to any curtailment of the VHI relief.  Yet they say that we are overspending, which will cause problems.</P>
    <P>Before I became a Member of this House the one person for whom I always had sympathy was the Opposition spokesman on the day of the budget.  His is an unenviable task; he must have an immediate response to anything from an hour to a two hour speech; he must detect the underlying trends in the speech and he must try to analyse it and, basically, to take it asunder.  It is a most difficult task, particularly when you speak immediately after the Minister for Finance who has had the benefit of advice and a prepared script.  I know that Opposition Deputies prepare some of their speech in advance but they must react to the budget speech.</P>
    <P>As I said, before I became a Member of the House I had great sympathy for the Opposition spokesman but my sympathy for Deputy Noonan is wearing very thin because his speech over the past four years has been almost the same every year.  In fairness, he has made an attempt to update it, this year he used very descriptive military terms &mdash; in deference to the Gulf war &mdash; and he also painted a nice picture of a broken car which Deputy O'Donoghue dealt with in great detail last night.  The picture he painted of the broken car was very amusing and I noticed that it subsequently appeared in a Fine Gael Party political broadcast.  I wonder if Deputy Noonan inspired the script or if he just stole the idea from it. Some people indeed have suggested &mdash; flatteringly for Deputy Noonan &mdash; that he could supply his scripts to a well known Saturday satire programme.  That is a little flattering and because he repeats the same criticism every year of the budget, his script would be more appropriate to a Hal Roach show &mdash; that gentleman's scripts generally have the same names and places.

      <Col N="2072" /> Over the last four years Deputy Noonan predicted that the budget would not work.  For three years running he said that there would not be any growth becuse the Government figures were over-optimistic.  He predicted that the Government would not control public expenditure, that the buoyancy contained in the figures produced by the Government was over-estimated and that there would be trouble in store at the end of the year.  He also predicted that the revenue was over-estimated.  There is no need to underline the fact that, in each of the last four years, he was proved wrong.</P>
    <P>The budget was drawn up in an air of uncertainty because of the Gulf war and the problems it might pose for investment. There is a recession in the United States and the United Kingdom and the budget was also framed under other constraints like our commitments under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Fianna Fáil have an on going commitment to the less well off, especially the old, those on low pay and on social welfare.  There was a general consensus that there was very little room for manoeuvre and that the Minister had to be very careful.  The post-budget analysis by most of the commentators accepted the fact that there were constraints but that the budget was a very responsible one in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to specific areas of the budget.  One of the things about which I am most pleased is the commitment to the less well off which was underlined in the budget in relation to social welfare and taxation areas.  The total value of the package of measures for people on social welfare or working for low pay amounts to £164 million in a full year.  The increases in expenditure are right across the board, from short term unemployment assistance and carer's allowance to adult dependant allowances and child income support.  All the measures in the budget for child income support were outlined by the Minister and will cost £41 million, which is a commitment to the family and to children.  Families on low pay will benefit from the improved <Col N="2073" /> family income supplement and the tax exemption schemes.  The package for social welfare and taxation regarding the lower paid was very comprehensive.</P>
    <P>The criticism levelled at various budgets &mdash; and at the Government &mdash; about the lack of implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare is totally unjustified in the context of this and previous budgets.  It is very hard to accept criticism from Fine Gael or Labour in this area because they had the report over a two year period and they had two years to take the first tentative steps in following the recommendations but did not do so.  Yet, they now criticise us for not implementing almost immediately all the recommendations listed.  The Government have been going through the list and to date 46 of the 67 or so recommendations made have been wholly or partially implemented.  Furthermore, the four priorities listed have been tackled.</P>
    <P>Also on the area of social welfare, I note that in his comments on the budget Deputy Byrne spoke at great length about a conference on poverty held in Galway in June 1990, during the Irish Presidency of the European Community, as part of the Commission's Third EC Poverty Programme.  The conference was attended by 150 representatives of voluntary and statutory organisations from the various member states including those dealing with the mentally and physically handicapped and the unemployed as well as by representatives of the European Commission, the Council of Europe and other representative international organisations.  A wide range of voluntary Irish organisations was also represented at the conference which provided the foundation for the development of a policy on the voluntary sector, at both national and European level, and in particular for the relationship between the State and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that the conference was a success and as a result the Minister intends taking a number of major initiatives in the voluntary sector. The conference had a major input into the formulation of proposals in this <Col N="2074" /> regard.  I find it very hard to accept Deputy Byrne's criticism and he seemed to imply that, as it was a conference on poverty, those attending should have been kept in hovels, that no money should have been spent on them and that they should have either walked or used some inferior transport in getting to and from the conference centre.  Ireland was chosen as the location for the conference because of its commitment in this area. Therefore Deputy Byrne's criticism should be rejected out of hand.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the question of capital acquisitions tax, which I will deal with in greater detail during the course of the discussion on the Finance Bill.  I would ask the Minister in drafting the changes he is going to bring about in the Finance Bill in this area to tackle one anomaly which exists in the system and which relates to those living together but not legally married, in other words two single people living together in a common law marriage.  If one or other dies and the other is named in the will as the sole beneficiary, under existing legislation that person will find themselves at a major disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> a married partner.  As I said, I will elaborate further on this matter during the course of the debate on the Finance Bill but it should be borne in mind that a person legally married, on the death of their partner, will not pay any capital acquisitions tax whereas a person who has been living with a partner in a common law marriage for four or five years will find themselves £32,500 worse off.</P>
    <P>As I have agreed to share my time with Deputy Kitt, I will conclude on that note.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to sincerely thank my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, for his generosity.  At the outset I would like to deal with the question of corporation tax. Some Deputies have argued that the corporate sector are not paying their fair share of tax but the truth is that Fianna Fáil in Government, by way of measures adopted in previous years, have ensured <Col N="2075" /> that there is a substantial tax take from the business community and have ended grants and subsidies.  Furthermore, capital allowances have been cut and the day of the grant for machines is gone.  In 1990 the yield from corporation tax increased by more than 56 per cent over the previous year.  Export sales relief ended in April 1990 and all foreign companies now pay tax of 10 per cent on manufacturing profits.</P>
      <P>The yield from corporation tax in this country is higher than in most EC countries. For example, the yield in 1990 represented 2.1 per cent of GNP whereas the corresponding figure in Germany was 1.9 per cent.  Therefore the figures confirm that the business community are contributing substantially to the development of our economy.  Deputies on the Left continually say that we should get more from the corporate sector but they should look at the figures first before commenting on the future.</P>
      <P>Another issue which has been dealt with is the need to streamline our tax system.  I would argue that in the future we should make the tax system more intelligible.  It seems at present that it is understood only by the tax experts to whom the Revenue Commissioners send a news letter after each budget.  Whatever about its impact on employment, it is certainly true that it creates employment for accountants.  Given the different tax levels, reliefs, allowances and levies, is it any wonder that at the end of the Budget Statement very few people know if they are better or worse off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that it is not possible to change the Taxation Tower of Babel which has been constructed during the years but on a close examination of the tax system it is clear that anomalies still exist.  For example, if a low paid worker, such as a cleaner on £70 per week, gets a rise of £10 she will pay tax at a rate of 29 per cent, PRSI at a rate of 5.5 per cent and a health contribution income levy of 2.25 per cent giving a total tax take of 36.75 per cent, leaving her with £6.33 out of the £10.  However, if a taxpayer in the <Col N="2076" /> Michael Smurfit and Tony O'Reilly category gets an extra £10 he will pay tax at a rate of 52 per cent and health insurance tax at a rate of 2.25 per cent giving a total tax take of 54.25 per cent and leaving him with £4.58.  As one can see, there is not a huge difference between the two.  A tax system which treats a cleaner and Michael Smurfit almost as equals, as I have just illustrated, needs to be re-examined. We should discriminate in favour of the lower paid.  I ask the Minister to consider this in formulating a new budgetary policy.</P>
    <P>The budget is but one component of a larger comprehensive plan, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The previous programme, agreed in 1987, showed us that targets can be met.  Every single objective was achieved and it is clear that the Government have done a good job.  Despite the mish-mash of mixed Gulf War metaphors used by Deputy Noonan I am convinced he knows deep down that this is a good Government. It must have been very annoying for him that he could not find a like minded party to work with when in Government and that his party in hanging on to power, to keep Fianna Fáil out, brought the country to financial ruin. Deputy Noonan can fire all the Scud missiles he likes across the Chamber but they will have no impact.  He will find instead that there is a surplus of Patriot missiles on this side of the House and that we will not be shaken from our clear objectives, one of which is to ensure that the specific targets set out in the new programme are reached regardless of how many journeys Deputy Bruton and his colleagues take on the DART.  I safely predict that Fianna Fáil will still be in Government, to oversee the working of this historic programme, right up to the year 2000, indeed into the next century.  I hope I am right as the Government have strong public support and the country deserves many years of steady and decisive leadership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a contribution to this debate on the budget.  I listened with <Col N="2077" /> interest to what Deputy Kitt had to say and I contend that it would be a fate worse than death to have Fianna Fail in Government for the next ten to 15 years. I could not live with that possibility nor do the people expect it to happen.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach came in this morning to make a &ldquo;state of the nation&rdquo; address in the budget debate which was rather interesting. I presume he is not happy with the contributions from his Ministers or his backbenchers supporting this budget and obviously he came in to bolster the troops, but no amount of figures and percentages, GNP as a ratio of debt, national debt in relation to the population, cost of services and so on, will have any impact on the thousands of young people leaving this country annually.  Try to tell them that our ratio of debt to GNP is satisfactory, GNP is on the way up and this economy is moving, when they cannot get jobs here.  They will not listen, and if we fool ourselves into believing we are making progress when we are only glossing over the real problems, we will make no substantive progress in this House.</P>
      <P>This morning I heard on radio the Bishop of Ferns issue a statement to the effect that 7,500 of his people, young people, the backbone of this country, left his diocese in the last five years.  That can be repeated in every parish right across the country.  We all are aware of it.  At this time of year football coaches are getting their teams ready for the coming season, and of the 15 young men who were available last autumn five, six or seven have gone.  Places have to be filled and the clubs are thinking of amalgamating to try to form teams for the coming season.  That is sad.  For the Taoiseach to come in here and say we are making progress, that this country never had it so good, when such things are happening, is false and is not in the best interests of progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with health because I am particularly interested in it, as is every Deputy, and most of the contributions have dealt with it.  It is interesting that a senior Minister commented that this budget was like a blood transfusion to the economy.  It was not the Minister for <Col N="2078" /> Health; he would be too wise to say that. All I can say is I am glad I was not the patient because if I had had that blood transfusion I would be in intensive care now.  Probably that is where the economy is; it should be in the hands of the Fine Gael Party.  We have people with the ability to deal with that matter, people who have progressive minds to develop the economy.  There is ample scope for development and great opportunities are presented to us, but we are not grasping them.  However, all the opportunities and all the development are of no use if the people have not the comfort of knowing they have a good health care system.  In that regard our health care system has broken down.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Taoiseach this morning, in recognition of a comment I made here two evenings ago in relation to the plight of the aged, stated that in 1991 an additional £8 million is being provided to health boards for community health services.  I will be the first to acknowledge that that is a step in the right direction. The plight of the elderly is nothing short of a national disgrace.  It is not fair or acceptable that the aged &mdash; people of 65, 70,80 and the ripe old age of 90 &mdash; should be brought to the forefront to make their contribution to bring down the national debt.  Those people grew up in hard times in the thirties, twenties or even earlier and made their contribution and helped to build up this country.  We would not be here today if it were not for them. Now at the end of their days, when they should be enjoying their retirement, they find there is nobody to care for them. Elderly people are dying, literally, on the side of the road; they are dying lonely in homes or in their own houses that are not heated, not through their own fault, but because they are not able to look after themselves and we do not have a proper health care service to care for them.</P>
    <P>Every public representative weekly has representations from a family to get an old person into a nursing home or hospital, and there simply are not enough places.  Those lucky enough to gain admission will get some little care, but the pressure is on the hospital staff to <Col N="2079" /> move them out again.  I know of a 70 year old man who was sent to his 76 year old sister and 96 year old mother in a house with no facilities.  I have spoken to the staff in the hospital concerned.  I am not criticising the staff in the hospitals.  I know they are outstanding, dedicated people but they simply do not have sufficient staff to look after these patients. They are over-stretched.  Many of our nursing staff are on the verge of a nervous breakdown because they see what is happening. Wards are crammed and patients cannot be given individual attention; and hospital staff are being asked to do the dirty work for the health boards and the Department of Health by putting pressure on relatives to take patients home. Family and friends are reluctant to visit patients in hospitals because of the pressure exerted on them to bring the patient home when they know &mdash; and the nursing staff and the doctors know &mdash; that the patients are not in a suitable condition to be sent home, and in many cases they have nowhere to go.</P>
    <P>In deference to the family I will not mention names, but I have a letter here dated 4 February 1991 from a son whose father died in a hospital.  I will go no further out of respect to the staff who I know did all they could, but if I was to read that letter people would be shocked at the treatment that unfortunate man received.  There was nobody to look after him in a major hospital and he died a lonely man.  He entered the hospital on Monday, 7 January and died the following Sunday evening having received very little attention.  What happened in between makes a sad story.  This letter has been sent to me, to the chief executive officer of the health board concerned and to the Minister for Health.  The man who wrote it is an only son and he and his mother are very distressed.  I bring this to the attention of the House in an effort to ensure that such a tragedy will not happen again.  I will say no more about that.</P>
    <P>We have a waiting list for orthodontic treatment in the North-Eastern Health Board area.  I must be parochial now and <Col N="2080" /> fight my own cause because many services available in Dublin are far removed from the Cavan-Monaghan area I represent. We have no orthodontist.  I am not qualified to give an opinion on orthodontic treatment, but parents and nursing staff tell me it needs to be carried out in the early years or early teens.  Beyond that, irreparable damage can occur. Those are the formative, important years.  What advice is being given to parents whose children attend for checkup or are notified through the schools selection &mdash; which is quite good &mdash; where the nurse calls to examine the children, sees the problems and recommends that treatment or action be taken to have them corrected?  They are being advised to go to Northern Ireland.  Here we have this great Republican Government yet these people are advised to go to Northern Ireland to get cheap treatment.  Yes it is cheaper in Northern Ireland.  Something that would cost a private patient in the region of £1,200 to £1,500 in a hospital in this country can be carried out in Northern Ireland for around £750 or £800.  It is a substantial reduction but it is still a great deal of money and parents with young families simply cannot afford it.  That is not acceptable.  Likewise, the waiting list for hip replacement operations continues, with people experiencing great pain and discomfort.  It is a very successful operation for those who can have it.  I want to compliment Navan Hospital, its staff and doctors who carry out these operations so successfully.  Hip replacements mean a new life to people, are enormously successful, bringing them great comfort.  But we must remember that there remains a long waiting list. Constituents come to me and ask whether I could ascertain what it would cost them to have such an operation if they were to go private.  Of course they can have it done privately but one is talking then about a figure of £2,000 to £4,000, which simply is not available.  Then there are the operations necessitated by the removal of cataracts for people with eyesight problems in respect of which there is a long waiting list also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2081" /> I have no doubt that Deputy Connaughton, our spokesperson on social welfare, will deal with the carer's allowance, application of which is somewhat like the birds in the forest &mdash; one must catch them oneself.  When that allowance was announced people thought it was marvellous and they would receive financial recognition for the work they were undertaking looking after dependent relatives.  So often a son or daughter devotes his or her life to looking after an elderly parent or parents who find, after the demise of that parent or parents, they are then too old to make a life for themselves, discovering that they have missed out because of their long dedication. That is a great tradition in this country; thank God &mdash; we have this caring attitude to our elderly by sons, daughters, nieces, nephews and neighbours prepared to give of their time in that cause.  There should be recognition of their dedication and care.  I think there were approximately £48 per week available in respect of this allowance, but there was a sting in the tail in that it was means tested.  This means that if one's income was above the limit, one was not eligible.  It was soon discovered that very few people could avail of that allowance. While I do not mean to make fun of it, it transpired that if one was minding a clucking hen in a backyard, one would not be eligible for this allowance.  That is most disappointing for people who thought that would help them in their good work, giving them some financial recognition therefor, whereas many discovered they were beyond the income limit and did not qualify.  It has been pointed out to me that if one were a small farmer, or somebody running, let us say, a small business, little grocery shop, with a son or daughter minding an aged parent in a house above the shop or on the farm &mdash; in the case of a farmer with a couple of cows &mdash; one did not qualify.  There is no evidence in this budget that there will be any improvement for such people.  It is a scandal and insult.</P>
    <P>On the question of agriculture I must take the Taoiseach to task.  He went to <Col N="2082" /> two extremes.  He spoke of farm incomes having fallen by 5 per cent last year.  I am surprised at the Taoiseach, a former Minister for Agriculture, whom I know has an interest in land.  If he is not aware that farm incomes have fallen by a minimum of 20 per cent he is not in touch.  If his Minister has not advised him of that fact, than I suggest he should move him if for that reason only.  Then the Taoiseach went on to the other extreme and said that, in 1989, farm incomes had increased by 51 per cent.  So it appears that, when they are falling, they are down marginally only but, when they are rising, they go though the roof.  That is nonsense; farm incomes did not increase by 51 per cent in 1989 and there are no figures to substantiate that claim.  That is very annoying to people who are endeavouring to eke out a reasonable income on small farms, those people sorely hit at present.</P>
    <P>I have been harping on the issue of severely handicapped areas since I became a Member of this House because such designation would be of tremendous benefit to my constituency of Cavan/ Monaghan.  One must ask what is happening to the application for the extension of that scheme.  I have here in my possession a letter from Joe McCartin, MEP, dated 6 Februarty 1991 in which he says:</P>
    <P>You could say that the proposal by the Irish Government has been rejected by the Commission but this is, of course, arguable.  It seems that the Commission has questioned the Government's proposals for an extension on the grounds that it does not follow a reasonable geographical pattern and, therefore, are not entirely compatible with the original legislation.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the poor man who lost his ministerial position, Deputy Brian Lenihan, had to come in and apologise for misleading the Dáil in reply to a question I had tabled with regard to what was happening to the severely handicapped areas application.  Four years later we are no further on.  For the first time since <Col N="2083" /> 1987 the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk, acknowledged in this House that an application had been lodged for an extension of the severely handicapped areas in respect of all of Cavan and Monaghan, lodged by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, in 1987. That had always been denied until 12 December last when it was rectified and put on the record of this House, though I had been claiming that to be the case incessantly.  Deputy Connaughton seated in front of me will have worked on its presentation which had been acceptable in Brussels but was withdrawn by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government for the reason, they said, it had been poorly presented.  Four years later after endless research, officials having been sent around the country ascertaining farmers' stocking rates and so on &mdash; while all of that information was available already in the Department of Agriculture and Food &mdash; its presentation was rejected.</P>
    <P>This very day, and no later, the Minister should come into this House and make a clear, categorical statement, of the exact position with regard to this matter because it will have serious repercussions nationally.  Here I might quote from Directive 73 of 1975 as follows:</P>
    <P>The livestock headage payments on cattle and/or sheep are intended as an income supplement which will compensate farmers in the very worst areas for the income limitations which the physical conditions of the land impose on them.  The aim is to encourage farmers to remain in these poor areas so as to ensure the continuation of farming, the maintanance of a reasonable level of population and the preservation of the countryside.</P>
    <P>Could anything be clearer &mdash; Directive 73 of 1975, 16 years ago?  Do all of Cavan and Monaghan not qualify under the provisions of that directive?  Would the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for Finance, the Tánaiste or Minister for Health come into this House and explain to the farmers of Cavan and <Col N="2084" /> Monaghan how the Minister for Finance was able to get his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, to submit an application for all of Longford and Roscommon and omit 40 per cent of Cavan and 70 per cent of Monaghan?</P>
    <P>I will give one example of the outrageous behaviour engaged in with regard to this application.  I might add that it did not surprise me it was rejected in Brussels.  A farmer in Longford with a milk quota in excess of 20,000 gallons &mdash; he is not a small farmer &mdash; with a store cattle enterprise on his farm and a sheep herd as well, according to the Minister for Finance, is severely handicapped and in need of aid from Brussels.  Yet a farmer in Cavan &mdash; in Crossdoney up the road from my home &mdash; with a milk quota of 3,000 gallons and a net income of £1,756 last year is not regarded as being handicapped according to the Tánaiste and Minister for Health; he needs no aid from Brussels; he is well able to look after himself and cater for his wife and three children.  That is pure, political skulduggery. Of course the reason that Longford and Roscommon were included is that, at the next general election, it will be a four-seater constituency, when the Government hope to take the maximum number of seats.  That is the business of Longford and Roscommon but I think they will be in for a surprise on that occasion.  If the people of Cavan and Monaghan put up with that type of nonsense, they might as well forget about it. However, I do not think they will because we cannot allow that to happen.  I emphasise: there are no more enterprising people than the farmers of Cavan and Monaghan, particularly bearing in mind the conditions in which they work.  The livestock headage payments would be a means of their maintaining a lively viable farm holding in that region.</P>
    <P>According to the Irish Farmers Association case for increasing headage payments in disadvantaged areas in 1991:</P>
    <P>Headage payments which have been applying in Ireland since 1975 are now a very important part of farmers' <Col N="2085" /> incomes... The last increase for headage payments for cattle and sheep was in 1981; only suckler cow headage rates have been increased in the meantime, in 1986.</P>
    <P>I will give another interesting fact in relation to headage payments which are vitally important.  In Germany the average payment amounts to £1,060; in France, £1,023; in Belgium, £878; in Luxembourg, £1,827; and in the UK, £2,626, whereas the average headage payment here is £605.  An effort is not being made to reap the benefits available from these schemes developed in Brussels for regions far removed from the market place and which are disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>We can pay up to £104 per head in headage payments but we are not doing so.  The Minister for Finance stated in his budget that an increased payment was being made this year.  I think the Minister mentioned £19 million. It now transpires that that £19 million is made up of 65 per cent of moneys from Brussels.  The money is not coming from the Government's pocket.  How dare they claim that they are making that extra contribution to the farmers.  That is not acceptable.  If that is to be the carry on, the people will become very disillusioned. I appeal to the Minister to designate all of Cavan and Monaghan as being severely handicapped.  There is an unanswerable case for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could talk for another half hour on the condition of roads although I have only one minute left.  Of course, I will be told of the increase in road grants this year and what it will mean.

      <P>Last Wednesday's budget was not an easy one to frame.  Nobody can pretend that the economic background internationally is ideal at present.  The underlying circumstances are certainly less favourable than those in more recent years.  Great uncertainty is emerging on the horizon from the general economic downturn in the major Western economies.  To that we must now add the tragic conflict in the Gulf.  In times past, this island country might have tended towards excessively insular economic policies.  Those times have long since gone; this budget had to take account of adverse international developments and this prevented us from doing certain things as quickly or as extensively as we would otherwise have liked.  The situation was not helped by the enormity of the special pay awards to the public sector, something that the Cabinet do not have direct control over. This aspect of public pay policy will have to be urgently reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the current international economic situation is not as favourable as we might like it to be, we have not stood back from adopting useful measures, within our own control, to improve our situation.  There is no basis for undue pessimism.  We can legitimately take <Col N="2087" /> heart from some of our economic achievements to date.  The main economic indicators are positive enough to suggest that we can consolidate and build upon the progress we have already made. Among the more notable of our achievements to date are: an annual inflation rate, amongst the lowest in the EC; economic growth of about 10 per cent over the last two years; an improvement in our external competitiveness; the balance of payments remaining in a healthy surplus; the National Debt/GNP ratio moving steadily downwards; improved living standards for the less well-off; and also, significant progress on tax reform.</P>
    <P>I am not for a moment suggesting that our work programme in these vital areas is complete.  Certainly, for tax reform and unemployment, an awful lot remains to be done before we can record any degree of satisfaction.  This budget and the recently negotiated <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> set out to tackle, in an integrated way, the problems that confront us.  None of the issues or problems are being shirked.  The 1991 budget is, I suggest, yet another most definite step in the right direction.  But that is all it is, a step.  We have a long road to travel yet.</P>
    <P>Indeed, listening to Deputy Dukes making a most hypocritical speech earlier on, I was reminded of how far we have travelled since he was Minister for Finance. It is no harm to put on the record the index of misery for the year 1985 when Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance, who is now suggesting that the Progressive Democrats are not making fast enough progress in implementing our income tax proposals, when we have told the world that it is a four year programme. It is no harm to remind Deputy Dukes how far we have to travel from the penal tax rates he imposed on this country, where we had rates of 35 per cent, 48 per cent and 60 per cent.  At least we have reduced the standard rate by 6 per cent since those days, and the top rate is down by 8 per cent since those days.  There is a firm commitment in this budget to continue reducing the standard <Col N="2088" /> rate and the top rate until, after the next two budgets, we come to a stage where we will have a 25 per cent standard rate and a rate of 48 per cent.  That will not be the end of income tax reform.  There are many other areas of the taxation system which need to be reformed.  These rates of tax cannot be taken as the only aspect of tax reform necessary.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dukes was Minister we had unemployment of 226,000 people or 17.3 per cent.  We had a growth rate of GNP at a miserly half per cent.  That has now gone up to 4 per cent in 1990.  The current budget deficit was 8.4 per cent of GNP.  It is now down to 1.2 per cent.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement was 12.9 per cent and that is now down to 2.1 per cent last year and going down.  The living standards during the period in office of Deputy Dukes's Government were falling by 7 to 11 per cent, taking the average industrial earnings in that period.  We have seen a rise over the last two years of from 4 to 8.5 per cent in average industrial earnings.  I could go on with a long list outlining the state the country was in under Deputy Dukes and the Government of which he was a member.  One must put things into context when one speaks here.  The facile way in which Deputy Dukes sought to castigate the Progressive Democrats will not wash, when we look at his record and the hard work we have to do to turn the situation around.</P>
    <P>The integrated concept underlying this budget and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is worthy of emphasis. This Government are focusing on policies that will successfully develop our economy and job prospects &mdash; in my own area of responsibility, forestry features prominently in the PESP and I will speak on this later if I get time.  But control of the public finances must also remain a priority.  The lessons of the past are that piecemeal, unco-ordinated strategies represent little more than a &ldquo;take now &mdash; pay later&rdquo; approach.  In a nutshell, sustainable progress is real progress.</P>
    <P>This budget is a measured, socially caring, progressive budget.  It sets tough <Col N="2089" /> but realistic targets, but it still offers good grounds for optimism in the future.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are in this Government to achieve change.  Among our priorities is major tax reform.  That is a four year programme and the more difficult decisions lie ahead.  This year's budget is laying further foundations for the radically new tax regime to which this Government are committed.  Of course, major changes are needed in the administration and delivery of health services as outlined this morning by my colleague, Deputy Quill.</P>
    <P>Earlier I stressed the international dimension and background to this budget.  Specifically, the Gulf conflict looms large.  It is, of course, a subject on which I must keep a particularly close watching brief given my responsibility for energy matters.  I have come to this House on a number of occasions to keep Deputies informed of the measures which have been taken to ensure that the impact of the Gulf conflict on oil supply is minimised. It is appropriate that I take this opportunity today to spell out the relatively satisfactory position now existing in Ireland in this regard.  Put succinctly, there is no need for undue concern.</P>
    <P>Compared with the oil supply crises of the seventies, Ireland is now far less exposed to oil supply difficulties.  In the early seventies, oil accounted for over 70 per cent of our total energy requirement. Now, the figure is less than 44 per cent. This did not happen by accident.  Ireland, in common with the major OECD economies, have for many years pursued policies to reduce dependence on oil; the dependency percentages I have just mentioned speak for themselves.  The two main factors behind the reduction were the advent of natural gas which is continuing to make major in roads into the energy market; and the switch towards coal for electricity generation.</P>
    <P>I will return to those two factors later but I mention them now in order to put a correct perspective on a lot of ill-informed comment that has been made about this country's state of preparedness, on the oil supply front.  It is against this changed background that we <Col N="2090" /> must consider our competence to bear the brunt of possible future oil shocks.  I will not pretend that our vulnerability has diminished out of sight &mdash; the position on the transport side remains, for the most part, unchanged but I have taken certain measures to further secure and enhance our position in that sector.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Gulf is, of course, uppermost in most people's minds at present.  At the outset of hostilities, many commentators expected it to lead to an international oil crisis, caused by shortages of oil and by very high prices.  Indeed in the week before hostilities started, market experts predicted a huge price rise as soon as war broke out.</P>
    <P>We are now, of course, aware that the war has not, fortunately, resulted in the price scenarios predicted.  Oil prices, far from rising, dropped about $10 on 17 January, and have remained around the $20 a barrel mark since then.  Oil supplies are abundant, and there is no logical reason to believe that this will change.</P>
    <P>The International Energy Agency, of which Ireland is a member, has confirmed that there has not been any significant reduction in crude oil exports from the Gulf region as a result of the outbreak of war in January.  Crude oil loading operations are continuing normally.</P>
    <P>Although it may appear that these facts have no direct bearing on the Irish oil supply situation &mdash; as we no longer import our oil from the Middle East &mdash; the widespread availability of crude oil on the world market serves to dampen down prices and demand.  This eases any pressure on supplies from other sources of production such as the North Sea, which is our main supply source.  I have been in contact with the oil companies to ensure that they have adequate shipping facilities in place to meet current and projected demand and am satisfied that they have sufficient procedures in place to continue to meet national needs.</P>
    <P>I have already focused on this country's falling dependence on oil.  Not alone am I anxious to reduce further our use of oil but I am taking steps to achieve a reduction in our overall energy consumption. Deputies will be aware of <Col N="2091" /> advertisements I placed in the national newspapers suggesting ways in which people could achieve this through transport use, energy in the home, fuel switching and electricity use.  I would remind people that energy conservation is a saving, not just to the State in terms of oil use, but financially to each individual.</P>
    <P>Ordinary energy consumers should commit themselves whole-heartedly to the energy conservation message.  The Government will continue to do what they can to promote the message and give valuable advice but the people themselves must translate the sound message into sound practice.  This should and must be done irrespective of the potential threats to oil supplies posed by the present Gulf crisis.  The careful use of all forms of energy, not just oil, has always been an important part of my Department's energy policy.  While the current Gulf crisis may now tend to give it added impetus, the conservation message would be valid even if we were getting oil at considerably lower prices.  I shall ensure that the Department's energy conservation programme, no matter what happens in the Gulf, is rigorously pursued and implemented.</P>
    <P>My Department will also continue to support alternative energy sources, where it is economically and technologically feasible to do so.  In particular, I am hopeful that a decision will soon be possible as to which of the firms who tendered for it will be selected to build Ireland's first windfarm in County Mayo.  This will be eligible for a capital allocation of up to nearly £4 million under the EC's Valoren Programme.</P>
    <P>A key method of cushioning ourselves against the kind of shocks experienced in the late seventies and early eighties is to maintain oil stocks additional to normal requirements.  Since 2 August last year, various measures have been taken by me to ensure that national stock levels were increased to meet, and indeed to exceed, EC and IEA stock requirements.  The throughput at the national refinery was maximised in order to boost petrol and <Col N="2092" /> gasoil stocks; the Whiddy storage terminal was reactivated to hold 205,000 tonnes of crude oil and unused storage capacity belonging to the ESB and in the private sector was brought into commission to hold additional product stocks.</P>
    <P>The national stocks situation is good. As of yesterday evening the position is that we have 102 days stocks of petrol, 89 days stocks of middle distillates &mdash; gasoil and derivatives and 283 days stocks of fuel oil.  Given the present favourable international oil supply situation, I am satisfied that an appropriate level of oil stocks is now being held by this country.  Ireland has an oil stock obligation through membership of the EC and IEA.  These obligations are being met and, might I add, very comfortably so.  Oil stocks held by the INPC oil companies and large consumers now represent an aggregate of 111 days supply.</P>
    <P>As a further measure I have set up two national groups to advise on how best to manage the Irish oil market until the international oil market gets back to normal.  I have already given the House information on that matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from the measures I have taken to date and which I have just described, international organisations of which we are members have been monitoring the oil situation and have taken precautionary measures to cope with developments to date in the oil market. The International Energy Agency has asked its members to reduce market demand by 2.5 million barrels a day.  This involves an agreed stockdraw of 2 million barrels a day and consumption reduction of 500,000 barrels a day through demand restraint measures.  Even though no shortfall emerged, the IEA agreed to keep the stockdraw decision in place but to be implemented flexibly and in close consultation with the IEA.  The European Community will also act in unison to reduce consumption if a shortfall in supplies occurs.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party, speaking in this House on 18 January, said that the Labour Party had tabled a series of questions to the Minister for Energy, who was due to answer <Col N="2093" /> parliamentary questions on the day the Dáil resumed, with a view to seeking clarification of the misleading information and advice emanating from the Department of Energy in relation to national reserves of petrol and diesel. There is no question of my Department issuing misleading information.  There would be no reason for us to do so.  I consider this allegation and the request for an independent authority to measure the stocks we hold to be a reflection on the integrity of the civil servants working in the Department of Energy.  I absolutely and completely refute the allegation made by Deputy Spring on that occasion. There has been no change of any kind in the method of calculating stock figures since the setting up of the Department in 1980, nor during the period when Deputy Spring was Minister for Energy.  Many of the people who are responsible for calculating these figures and making measurements of these stocks are the same officials who served under Deputy Spring and whom he never questioned.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy Spring chose to try to create panic during the RTE interview on 28 September when he said he was against the stockpiling of oil here.  When asked if we should stop stockpiling oil ourselves, he replied that in his view we should not be stockpiling at this time. That was in September, after Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait.  Deputy Spring has changed his tune, he began by arguing against our having an adequate supply in the country and then tried to challenge the figures we gave.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that if Deputy Spring when Minister for Energy had not exported from the Bantry terminal the strategic stocks of fuel held there in May 1985 it would not have been necessary for me to commit such large amounts of scarce resources to buying in stocks now to try to put oil back in Whiddy.  If the 115,000 tonnes of oil taken out by Deputy Spring had been left there, this country would have had some level of strategic stocks available to meet the crisis which arose last August.  It was Deputy Spring who chose to release the 115,000 tonnes of crude oil.  In March <Col N="2094" /> 1986 when Deputy Spring was Minister for Energy our level of stocks was well below international requirements &mdash; 62 days supply of motor spirit, 65 days of middle distillates and 95 days of fuel oil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring puts forward a poor argument in seeking to accuse me of not performing my duties when he was largely responsible for many of the problems which confront us today in view of the removal of strategic stocks which were in place.  I hope Deputy Spring, who has made a fool of himself over these figures, will have the decency to apologise to the Department and especially to the civil servants whom he has wrongly accused. I hope he will do so at some time in the near future and remove the confusion and chaos which he tried to engender in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>One unexpected benefit of the events of recent months has been the realisation of many people of the importance to Ireland of the Whiddy Oil Terminal and the refinery at Whitegate.  The Government have always appreciated the importance of these two facilities, and are anxious to promote investment in the facilities to maximise the economic benefits associated with them.  Discussions are ongoing to find a suitable partner or partners to develop these important strategic assets.  Of course, at present, in a volatile international situation oil companies may be slow to make investment decisions, but discussions are continuing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>Since the 1991 allocations were notified to the health boards on 18 December last, my Department have kept in constant touch with the boards, who have been engaged in drawing up service plans for 1991.  I am aware that, while the allocations may not enable all health boards to maintain the level of throughput achieved in 1990, boards will, at a minimum, be in a position to provide services at the level prevailing in the latter part of 1989 which, in fact, was the approved level of service for 1990.  Many boards were operating last year at activity levels considerably above this approved level. With management of the targeted levels of activity and enhanced commitment to the achievement of value for money, particularly through inter-agency co-operation, I am satisfied that health boards will be in a position to provide a satisfactory service throughout this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer Question No. 1, that is, list the health <Col N="2096" /> boards which have indicated they are unlikely to be able to maintain services at the 1990 level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy says, the health boards have indicated they may not be able to maintain activity at the level of 1990.  What I told the health boards when I gave them their allocations was that we expected them to work at the approved 1990 level.  As the Deputy appreciates, the health boards went beyond the 1990 level in 1990 for a number of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that yesterday in the House he boasted of the achievements in 1991 of growth in the services and that it is inconsistent of him today to tell the health boards to wind back all those achievements to the 1989 level?  Will he tell the House why these health boards are reporting an aggregate shortfall of £20 million?  Can he further confirm that the increase over the outturn in 1990 in his allocation for 1991 in percentage terms is minimal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the House yesterday I pointed out to the Deputies that the Government have provided £1,426 million, the largest amount ever provided by any Irish Government since the foundation of the State, for the health services whereas in 1987 in the Department of Health we received just over 18 per cent of the total Exchequer funding for the health services.  In the current year we are receiving 22 per cent which is a very sizeable increase and a very large percentage of what the Exchequer is providing for public services.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that it is an indication of the Government's commitment to maintain services at a high level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Bruton's question about the level of service in 1990, Deputies will appreciate that this time last year there was a 'flu epidemic.  That epidemic caused increased pressure on the service. There was a 14 per cent increase in admissions to hospitals and that, thankfully, has shown no sign of being repeated this <Col N="2097" /> year.  All the evidence is that there will not be a 'flu epidemic this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister would state that the factual position was that three out of eight boards rejected the allocation by a majority decision and that one other health board has yet to make a decision.  Will the Minister try, for once, to explain how he arrives at the view that a health board, such as the Southern Health Board, could maintain the 1989 level of service when the additional funding for 1990 included that for dental treatment, care of the elderly and the 'flu epidemic and when the level of service provided in 1990 was on the increased allocation?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the point.  All in all, at the end of 1990 the health board, in their assessment, showed that they required £152 million and the decision made by the Minister to allocate £149 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect let me ask, does the Minister realise that the allocation to the Southern Health Board would mean providing for 1,000 less patients in the Cork Regional Hospital at this time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock is right that a number of health boards have rejected their allocation.  There may be some confusion in the House because Deputy Ferris says that is the first time that happened since the Health Act, 1970.  In fact it happens every year. Deputy Sherlock is a member of a health board as is Deputy Ferris.  I was a member of a board for 17 years and I am aware of it happening on a regular basis. On initial examination of the budget boards reject the proposals put forward <Col N="2098" /> by management and when they go back and have another look at them they accept the budget.  Only one board, the Southern Health Board some years ago, did not accept the recommendation of the management.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Southern Health Board one has to compare like with like, and the original allocation to that board was £143 million in 1990.  It is £149 million this year, an increase of £6 million.  I am satisfied that that should be sufficient for them to maintain their services at the approved 1990 level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the £20 million shortfall in the budgets of the health boards will result in longer seasonal and some bed closures, the closure of geriatric beds for which he expressed particular concern to see growth, and to the postponement of locum substitution for nursing?  It will, according to all the health boards, seriously affect their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be seasonal closures this year.  It is important to point out to the House that seasonal closures have nothing to do with a lack of funding. Seasonal closures have been a part of hospital activity for as long as I can remember.  I, for one, would expect hospitals to close wards if it was only to wash the walls or paint them.  I was a house man and I know all about it.  A whole corridor was closed for a month back in the good old days in the sixties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the additional services he asked the board to provide, the increase in wages which came under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> and the rate of inflation leave the board in a situation where it cannot provide that level of service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the increase in salaries does take up much of the increased allocation.  However, the Government were adamant that there should be more value for money, something that Deputies talked about for years.  We now have the benefit of the Foxe report and are discussing its implications with the health agencies.  I am glad to say that there has been substantial progress in that regard.  As far as value for money is concerned we have already got a better deal for drugs with more efficiency in the use of drugs.  I believe there are savings to be made there in the current year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the reports referred to but, first, I would like to say that funding to mental handicap agencies directly funded by my Department has increased in real terms and is now 40 per cent higher than it was in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's allocation to these agencies is 6 per cent higher than in 1990.  Last year <Col N="2100" /> the Government provided an additional allocation of £2 million in the budget for the mentally handicapped and this provided 170 new residential places, 442 day places, respite care services for 66 families and 25 staff for other supports. This provision has been repeated this year and in addition the Government have allocated a further £1 million in the budget so that we may continue the improvements we carried out in the past year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that his £1 million provision is less than three-quarters of 1 per cent of the budget for mental handicap and that there is no hope in the wide earthly world that that is adequate to deal with the estimated 1,000 people waiting for residential places, the 1,000 people waiting for places in day centres?  Would he not further agree that the treatment for mental handicap patients is chronic at present with fewer than half the parents getting an opportunity for a respite break?</P>

      <P>I accept that there are gaps in the service and indeed it is one of the services where there have been gaps for a long number of years.  Because of that I have ensured that over the past five budgets they would be well protected and as I have pointed out to the Deputy there has been a 40 per cent increase in their allocation, they received £58 million in 1986 and £81.6 million in 1991&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 10 and 52 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of health policy towards the elderly are: to maintain elderly people in dignity and independence in their own home; to restore those elderly <Col N="2102" /> people who became ill or dependent to independence at home; to encourage and support the care of the elderly in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies in every way possible; and to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for elderly people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.</P>
    <P>These objectives were set out in the report of the working party on services for the elderly, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> published in 1988. An additional allocation of £5 million was made available last year to develop home and community services for the elderly as recommended in the policy document. This funding has enabled boards to strengthen substantially the support they can offer elderly people and their carers at home.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> identifies the priorities for the development of services for the elderly based on the recommendations of The Years Ahead as the expansion of home nursing, respite and other support services for the elderly and their carers living at home and the provision of specialist assessment and rehabilitation units in the main acute general hospitals and adequate numbers of extended care beds in those boards experiencing a rapid increase in the elderly population, particularly in the Eastern Health Board area. The additional funds made available in this year's budget to develop services for the elderly will enable progress to be made towards meeting these priority needs.</P>
    <P>The provision of sufficient beds for people who no longer require acute hospital care and extended care beds for the elderly is a matter for each health board in the first instance.  I am aware that some health boards are examining how patients who no longer need to be in an acute hospital, can be cared for in more appropriate accommodation.</P>
    <P>The number of elderly patients in public extended care facilities is approximately 8,500.  The number of extended care beds for the elderly in private and <Col N="2103" /> voluntary nursing homes and hospitals subvented by health boards is approximately 3,500.  I am satisfied with the adequacy of the overall provision of long-stay accommodation for the elderly but I recognise that a particular problem exists in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, chaired by Professor David Kennedy, has recently highlighted the need to increase the number of extended care beds for the elderly in the greater Dublin area.  The additional funds made available in this year's budget to develop services for the elderly will enable progress to be made towards meeting these needs.</P>
    <P>Details of the number of patients on waiting lists for extended care beds are maintained locally by each health board and are not readily available in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply in which he details his aspiration and the reports he has commissioned. The Minister is obviously not aware of the problems of people requiring geriatric care and attention and accommodation. Is the Minister not aware of the waiting lists in all geriatric institutions or the waiting lists for sub-acute beds for older people?  The Minister is obviously not aware that a person must wait for somebody else to die in one of these institutions before another bed becomes available?  Is the Minister aware that public health nursing and the community supports that were provided for in the budget will not address that problem?  If the Minister is not aware of this may I ask the Minister to have the health boards brief him on it as in all other health board areas apart from the Eastern Health Board on which he has commented there is a crisis in services for this segment of the community who need geriatric accommodation and not services in their own home, which is a different subject. There is a specific need for sub-acute and geritatic accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the fact that we have an increasing number <Col N="2104" /> of elderly people in our community, that we have an increasing number of dependent elderly people who are dependent on the State and that they are becoming a higher percentage of the population as a whole.  Because we recognise the increasing need, £5 million was provided in the budget last year and £3 million this year was targeted specifically towards the elderly to ensure that we will build up our community services.  As part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we will spend very substantial sums of money, up to £90 million in the final year on the current side and £100 million over the seven years on the capital side, to build up services which are specifically targeted at dependent people, the elderly, the mentally handicapped, the psychiatrically ill, the physically disabled.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the areas of elective surgery where patients seeking public hospital treatment, experience the longest waiting times; and the way these times compare to the waiting time he would regard as acceptable.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained on many previous occasions that waiting lists have always been a feature of all health <Col N="2105" /> care systems throughout the world and this will continue given the infinite demands which will be made on finite resources.  We are fortunate to live in an age when better health care has resulted in longer life expectancy and when the success of new techniques and forms of treatment has improved the quality of life for many patients.  This has led, however, to increasing demands being placed on the health services with a consequent effect on waiting lists and waiting times. I have placed great emphasis on tackling waiting lists over the past few years. Waiting lists in Irish hospitals in most specialties are not excessive.</P>
      <P>Certain areas were, however, identified as requiring special attention.  The Deputy will be aware of my concern about the problems which had arisen in the provision of cardiac surgery, ear, nose and throat procedures, cataract and hip replacement operations and will also be aware that additional funds were made available in 1989 and 1990 to reduce waiting times in these areas.  The effects of the additional funding were clearly seen towards the end of 1989 and throughout 1990.</P>
      <P>The present waiting times for the specialties mentioned depends on the medical condition of the patient.  Waiting lists are kept under regular review by consultants.  Each patient is assessed having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and priority is given according to medical need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that as TDs we daily receive reports of waiting times from 12 to 18 months which by any stretch of the imagination is unacceptable?  Now that the Minister is dividing public and private medicine would he not agree that it is time to set down minimum standards that people could expect and that there are waiting times beyond which he will not permit people in need to wait?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Bruton has said.  We did receive complaints about waiting lists in the particular specialties to which I have referred, for <Col N="2106" /> example, ear, nose and throat procedures and hip operations.  I am glad to inform the Deputy that in Temple Street Hospital &mdash; a major supplier of ear, nose and throat services &mdash; the waiting list decreased by 58 per cent last year and the number of hip procedures at Cappagh Hospital was increased by 40 per cent last year.  There has been a very substantial increase in the number of procedures being provided.  They are not waiting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not quote from the letter.  I am merely saying that this is a letter I received, the basic text of which is that this elderly pensioner, at 72 years of age, must wait 12 to 15 months before she can have her sight restored.  Would the Minister not accept that a basic cataract operation is one that can and should be provided and should be a fundamental part of any healthy health system?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins has alluded to an individual case, but the point I am making is that there has been an improvement in the level of activity in this area.  As Deputies are aware, an extra £15 million was provided in 1989 and targeted specifically at the area of long waiting lists.  This was continued for all of 1990 and had a major impact on the delivery of service.  I would be glad to investigate any individual case for the <Col N="2107" /> Deputy but I cannot give him an answer here and now in relation to a specific case.  I can tell the House that Deputies came in here month after month to Question Time and highlighted individual cases of people who had to wait four years for hip replacements in areas where the waiting time for hip replacements was nine months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I am always fascinated by the Minister's replies. I should like to know what 40 per cent means because 40 per cent of very little can be nothing.  The Minister is selective in history; if he were to go back to the foundation of this House he would see that there were massive increases in wages and inflation since then.  Is it fair that anyone in need of a serious heart operation should be told that it will be almost two years before he would be accepted, and in the meantime he should try not to get excited?  Is it fair that his neighbours should have to rally round and collect money to enable him to have an operation?  Last week I was in touch with the hospital about a prostrate gland and I was told that nothing could be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the points raised by the Deputy.  It is unacceptable that people have to wait.  It is unacceptable to me as a doctor that people have to wait for service.  My whole philosophy is that people should be able to get the service they need immediately. It is unacceptable to me that a person with a pain in their hip has to wait three weeks.  The reality is &mdash; and Deputy Browne referred to the foundation of the State &mdash; that at the foundation of the State there were waiting lists.  There are waiting lists in every country of the world. For example, in Northern Ireland, which <Col N="2108" /> has half our population, the waiting time for an open heart procedure is twice as long as here.  That is a fact of modern life.  We are improving the facilities all the time.  The 40 per cent I am talking about in one hospital is quite substantial &mdash; 220 operations; the target was an extra 200 but they carried out 220 operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the Minister recognises that the financial allocations are not sufficient and are not what he would wish.  Does he intend to increase the allocation to health boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware a number of the health boards have requested a meeting with me.  At this time each year, following such a request, I meet the chairman and the chief executive officer of the health boards &mdash; I have already met two this week &mdash; and we discuss how they might live within their allocation.  As I said earlier at Question Time, the cost of drugs and value for money are two areas we have discussed with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that his new proposal in relation to acute beds will put an additional strain on waiting lists which he accepts are unavoidable and unacceptable?  If we put this additional strain on them that will be unacceptable too.  We have a dilemma because we want to bring out the truth. It is up to the Minister to reply and he has not convinced me that anything will be done about the waiting lists; in fact the contrary is true.</P>

Does he believe there is a reasonable medical service if a number of persons have to wait 13 months for hip replacement operations? Is it reasonable that a person should have to sell the shirt off his back to raise funds to have the operation?  Is it reasonable that, irrespective of where he got the money for the operation, he would pay for it rather than use his medical card because he believes if he cannot pay he will never get to the operating theatre?  Does the Minister think that is a good health service?</P>

May I ask the Minister therefore, why a directive has been issued by his Department to health boards advising them to reduce their services and activities to 1989 levels?  The implications of such a reduction in 1991 in the Southern Health Board area are 1,000 fewer elective surgery operations in Cork Regional Hospital, 700 fewer elective surgery operations in Tralee General Hospital and a <i>pro rata</i> reduction in all forms of elective surgery in the general hospitals in the Southern Health Board region.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is exactly the same as the end-1989 level.  As I have already told the Deputy, there was increased activity last year due to the major 'flu epidemic.  There is no evidence to suggest that this epidemic will be repeated this year.  I am being careful in case there is an epidemic, although all the evidence shows that there will not be one.  If the commentators in the Southern Health Board were as careful, perhaps it would not be necessary to have a reduction of 1,000 in the level of activity in Cork Regional Hospital.  I should like to know who knows what the level of activity in Cork Regional Hospital will be this year.  Nobody knows; we must wait until 31 December.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in contact with the health <Col N="2112" /> boards and I understand that the position is that the boards assess applicants on an individual basis and a decision on the supply of nappies is taken, based on the applicant's needs and circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that, apart from the fact that mentally handicapped people are living longer, there seems to be evidence which shows that certain types of mental handicap are on the increase?  For example, I understand there is evidence which shows that Down's syndrome is particularly prevalent, and growing, in Galway west and that other types of mental handicap are on the increase in other areas.  What research is being carried out by the Department in this area and what does the Minister hope to report to the House in due course as a result of same?</P>

      <P>I do not have specific figures for the different types of mental handicap and their prevalence in Ireland. I do not have any evidence to substantiate what the Deputy has said but a survey is in course of preparation to try to get detailed information.

Would he not further agree that the provision this year of £1 million, when £23 million is arguably needed, and his lack of commitment to any improvement in residential accommodation and physio, speech and occupational therapy give the parents of handicapped children little hope that the programme will improve their position?</P>

      <P>There will be £90 million in real terms in the last year of the programme and it will increase each year until we reach that amount.  This is spelt out in the programme and is an indication of the Government's commitment to community services, including those for the mentally handicapped. I stand on my record in that regard and anyone can challenge me on it in terms of the funding which has been provided for the mentally handicapped since I came into office.

      <P>May I ask the Minister what he will say to the 422 people on the waiting list for residential accommodation in the Eastern Health Board area, some of whose parents are picketing outside the gate of this House today in terrible conditions in a desperate attempt to get accommodation for their relatives who suffer from some form of mental handicap?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept, as I stated before the Deputy came in, that there are gaps in the service.  This year while the £1 million will provide an increased number of places, we had decided, on the allocation before the extra money was provided in the budget, to open some of <Col N="2116" /> the places in Cheeverstown.  There will be a substantial number of places coming onstream this year in the Eastern Health Board area and of course in other health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the treatment meted out to the mentally handicapped and their families is nothing short of a national scandal? Would he agree further that absolute priority should be given in the health budget to these people who are the least advantaged and most defenceless sector in the community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy that the manner in which the mentally handicapped are treated is a national scandal.  That is a reflection on the people working in that area who provide such a quality and caring service that I defy anyone to point to anything better in Europe.  I accept there are gaps in the service and we have already discussed them.  This year, as a result of our original allocation, together with extra money provided in the budget, we will be closing some of those gaps.  Unfortunately it is not possible to close them all.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> spells out the Government's commitment over the next seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the total number of residential places required for the handicapped is about 2,000?  Would he further agree that with the additional £2 million provided last year 140 places were made available? That allocation has been reduced this year to £1 million, which presumably will provide approximately 70 places.  What about the other 1,000 places that are required?  We are not pulling figures out of the sky.  Has the Minister not heard of these figures?  Does he not agree the need is there, particularly in the area of the handicapped?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

In addition we have funded a lot of the voluntary organisations from national lottery funds for the development of community based <Col N="2118" /> activities.

      <P>I will deal with the Deputy's question now.  There will be no increase in the number of mentally handicapped people in psychiatric hospitals as a result of that policy.  As regards the provision of places, when places come <Col N="2119" /> onstream they are allocated on the basis of priority.  I am not sure that we would do justice to the 1,500 mentally handicapped people who are in psychiatric hospitals &mdash; many of them unfortunately have been institutionalised for 20 years and those institutions are now their homes &mdash; by taking them out and placing them in different surroundings.  Certainly any of them who would be more appropriately placed in the community or in other forms of accommodation will be so placed, but that will have to be considered in the context of the available places and the competing priority from people who are already waiting for places.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to the equipment of each health <Col N="2121" /> agency is part of the annual audit conducted in the agencies.  While no special audit has been carried out in respect of the items mentioned by the Deputy, my Department recently carried out a review of all surplus items held by each health agency with a view to maximising the use of such assets and developing a health service market for such equipemnt.  This process will continue as part of an overall value-for-money programme.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in 1990 all health boards were required to develop asset registers and detailed guidelines were issued in this regard.  Similar guidelines will be issued shortly to voluntary hospitals and organisations providing services for mentally handicapped persons.  Such asset registers will be subject to the prescribed annual audit.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress was made during 1989 and 1990 in commissioning newly built facilities.  At present, the main ward space which is unopened is at St. James's Hospital.  This will be fully commissioned before the end of 1991.  A 50 bed psychiatric unit at Tralee will be commissioned later this year.  Other hospitals may have small amounts of ward space unused for periods for a variety of reasons, including the provision of treatment on an outpatient or day basis.</P>

      <P>I do not have any figures in relation to the availability of equipment and, indeed, looking through the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General I do not see a reference to any major equipment.  I am unaware of any but as I said, an asset register is being established at the moment and I certainly agree with the Deputy that equipment not in use might be used somewhere else. The major space available is in St. <Col N="2122" /> James's and it will be open before the end of 1991.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the address I made to the House on 27 and 28 November 1990 &mdash; Official Report columns 220 to 549.  As I indicated on that occasion, the AIDS strategy and services are being monitored, adapted and developed in line with the changing epidemiology of the disease and the services requirements which this imposes. In this context, services for AIDS/HIV are being developed immediately in the following areas.  A significant proportion of HIV infection is initially diagnosed at STD clinics and in that context the appointment of a consultant in genito urinary medicine for the north side of Dublin was agreed by my Department in December 1990.  Early approval of the post by Comhairle na nOspidéal is awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2124" /> In addition, a GP based project in the Dublin area, with the necessary support services to enable persons with the infection to be treated at community-primary care level, is being developed.  This project will have a research component which will assist in the development of a protocol for a fuller involvement of GPs in the services than heretofore.  A further imminent development in the AIDS services is the provision of a community-based walk-in centre facility for persons with HIV/AIDS to serve the north side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Deputies can be assured that the funding necessary for maintaining and expanding services for AIDS/HIV will continue to be made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is very unsatisfactory not to have a proper planning of a service when it is known that there is a doubling of patients every 15 months?  Will he also agree that it is unsatisfactory that voluntary funding has to be called in to provide staff in some of the existing facilities?  The Minister has approved the appointment of a further consultant.  What is the delay in the consultant taking up the appointment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is no planning in relation to AIDS. However, the Deputy will appreciate that the picture relating to AIDS has changed considerably over the last nine years since it was firsty diagnosed.  For example, the numbers were doubling every six, seven or eight months but now, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, they are doubling every 15 or 16 months.  There has also been a small shift to the heterosexual population which was not evident in the early years in western countries.  We maintain the closest possible contact with our European partners and the World Health Orgainsation and every thing that we do is in line &mdash; and abreast of &mdash; what is being done in all other developed countries.  On the question of the appointment of a consultant to the north side of the city, when we approve an appointment it is then a matter for Comhairle na nOspidéal who have statutory <Col N="2125" /> responsibility to approve it.  We cannot appoint a consultant over their head as they have the statutory responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state whether there is a liaison between the voluntary bodies working with AIDS victims and the various health boards?  If not, will he agree that there should be such a liaison?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is now a need for an AIDS forum group in each of the health board areas which would draw people from the professionals and other voluntary agencies so that, at local level, there could be effective planning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have recently written to the health boards pointing out how we see the service developing for people with AIDS.  I referred earlier to the changing picture of AIDS, it is now becoming a chronic disease with which people live, whereas formerly it was a fatal illness.  We see the need to build up our community services and AIDS should be treated in the community as far as possible in the same way as other illnesses. This is the humane way to approach it from the point of view of the patient and it also makes good sense in terms of the delivery of health services.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>the steps he intends to take to change the practice whereby only students who are deemed to be in need of orthodontic treatment in 6th class in primary school are provided with treatment, thereby eliminating many needy and deserving cases which become evident, at a late stage, to be in need of orthodontal treatment and who are excluded as they did not satisfy the guidelines when they were in 6th class.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Act, 1970, requires the health boards to make dental treatment available to pre-school and national school children and to medical card holders and their dependants. Health board dentists carry out an assessment of all primary school children at about 12 years of age.  This is considered to be the appropriate age to ensure that the permanent dentition is sufficiently developed to facilitate the assessment. Children so assessed and found to meet the guidelines for treatment retain eligibility for free treatment even after leaving primary school.</P>
      <P>While only children of medical card holders retain elegibility for dental services after leaving primary school the chief executive officer of a health board can, if warranted and on hardship grounds, deem a person, other than a medical card holder, as being eligible for a particular service free of charge.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a specific case in mind, I would be glad to receive the details and to look into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I submitted this question because I have several cases in mind. Will the Minister agree that children mature at different ages?  What is his response to children over 12 years of age who exceed the guidelines and who are not eligible for orthodontic treatment but whose parents cannot afford it?  Does the Minister intend to take any steps to ensure that such cases receive orthodontic treatment?  It is my experience that once they have been deemed ineligible in sixth class in primary school they find it impossible to get such treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy forwards me information on each of the cases concerned I will pursue them with the appropriate health board as I would like to know why they were not diagnosed before leaving primary school.  While I am aware that problems are being experienced in the general dental service, it was not brought to my attention that this problem existed in the orthodontic service.  Most are diagnosed in primary school and many wait until they leave <Col N="2127" /> school before getting treatment.  It is important to establish the reasons the person to whom the Deputy has referred were not diagnosed while in national school.  I would be grateful if the Deputy forwards me their names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the guidelines are too severe?  Furthermore, if these pupils, whose names I will supply do need orthodontic treatment, will the Department provide the necessary finance and resources to the health board to ensure that they get it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines to which the Deputy has referred were laid down by my predecessor, the former Deputy Barry Desmond in 1985 and list five different categories.  I do not want to get political but there was a time when extra funds were not put into the dental service. I am very proud of the fact that we allocated an extra £3 million to that service last year and a similar sum will be provided this year.  There has been a large increase in the number of people receiving treatment even though I accept that there are people still on the waiting list.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there are waiting lists for orthodontic treatment in all health board areas and that even though children may be deemed eligible for such treatment the health boards are not in a position to provide it due to a lack of funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with that question.  I accept that there is a waiting list and because of my concern and that of the Ministers of State, Deputy Leyden and Deputy Treacy who had a particular interest in dentistry while in the Department, the Government provided an extra £300,000 in 1989, an extra £3 million in 1990 and a similar figure in this years budget to deal with the problem. We are making substantial progress but, just like the lists for other services, the waiting list cannot be cleared in one year.  With regard to the important point made by Deputy Ferris, when the former Deputy Desmond advertised for five orthodontists the health boards were only able to recruit one.  The position remains the same today.  Therefore it is not fair to say that it all comes down to the lack of funding.</P>

Is he further aware that category 2 patients are now being told that they will have to wait for at least two years for attention and that, ultimately, both category 1 and category 2 patients will have to seek private treatment which will have to be paid for by their parents after they leave primary school?</P>

      <P>I accept the reason orthodontists were not attracted to the health service may well be related to the conditions of service offered, but we have now reviewed these and are making substantial progress in our efforts to make the post more attractive.  However, we are still faced with the difficulty that there are insufficient orthodontists available. Even if we were to double the salary offered we would still be faced with the same problem.

      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="2131" /> not agree that it is extremely difficult to attract orthodontists into the public service and that the reason for this is the severe shortage of orthodontists in the country?

      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue is quite right.  More of the most simple type of orthodontic work is being done by dentists and more post-graduate training is available now through the dental hospitals. I have discussed with the dental hospitals how they might fit in with the facilities provided in Dublin by the Eastern Health Board to ensure that the maximum orthodontic service is available. We have provided the extra funding but there still is the problem a number of Deputies have alluded to.</P>

      <P>The recruitment of nursing staff is a matter for the chief executive officer of each health board in accordance with the terms of the Health Act, 1970.  There is no provision in this Act, or in the regulations made subsequent to its enactment, for the transfer of nursing staff from employment with one health board to employment with any other health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I am sympathetic to the matter, the central imposition of a scheme for the transfer of nursing staff would be viewed by the chief executive officers of the health boards as a diminution of their executive authority in <Col N="2134" /> recruitment matters.  It is of course open to the chief executive officers themselves to come to an agreement regarding the transfer of staff.  With this in mind, my Department have initiated discussions with the chief executive officers on this matter and it is hoped that progress will be made in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a list of case examples from my union, SIPTU, and I know the Minister is familiar with it. Does he not agree that it is bureaucracy gone mad that a nurse working in one health board area who wishes to exchange with a colleague nurse in another health area is not permitted to do so?  Does the Minister intend to take any steps to facilitate these transfers?  I remind him, and I am sure he agrees, that in the redeployment proposals agreed between the unions and his Department the chief executive officers seem to have no difficulty in arranging for posts to be filled.  Surely, subject to suitability, the arrangements ought to be more consistent as between health boards and the Minister should act to facilitate sensible inter-transfers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the Private Notice Questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, requires An Post to provide a national postal service to meet <Col N="2136" /> the industrial, commercial, social and household needs of the State for comprehensive and efficient postal services and so far as the company consider reasonably practicable, to satisfy all reasonable demands for such services throughout the State.  That Act also obliges An Post to conduct their affairs so as to ensure, <i>inter alia,</i> that their revenues are not less than sufficient to meet all charges properly chargeable to revenue account, to generate a reasonable proportion of capital needs and to remunerate capital and repay borrowings. Therefore, the company have a statutory obligation to ensure that they have sufficient revenue to fulfil their statutory duty.</P>
    <P>An Post are suffering unsustainable financial losses and there is a need for urgent action to restore the company to profitability.  The company lost £3.6 million in 1989 and an estimated £10 million last year.  On present policies An Post would lose £16 million this year and incur accelerating losses in the years ahead.  This crisis cannot be allowed to continue.  The main reasons for An Post's problems are increasing operating costs, low mail volume growth and competition from modern telecommunications services and couriers.  Staff costs, which account for 80 per cent of total operating costs, have increased sharply in recent years despite substantial staff reductions.</P>
    <P>An Post announced their viability plan yesterday.  The plan is aimed at reducing costs and improving operating efficiencies. The plan was drawn up by the company as a response to their serious and deteriorating financial situation.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question on 5 February 1991 the then Minister for Communications informed the House that he had approved proposals for certain increases in postal charges.  These increases will take effect on 2 April next. The increases work out at an average of 7 per cent or 2p on a standard letter.  My approval is not required for An Post's proposals to reduce their workforce or to close a number of their sub-post offices.</P>
    <P>I do not see a need to direct An Post to provide any loss-making services, as <Col N="2137" /> provided for under section 51 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  That Act gave An Post a commercial mandate and I am satisfied that the course of action suggested by the Deputies is not warranted.</P>
    <P>My statutory involvement in the operation of the plan is, therefore, limited to the approval of price increases and borrowings proposed by An Post. Implementation of the plan is a matter for An Post and I do not propose to interfere with the company in that regard.</P>
    <P>An Post will have detailed discussions with the unions on the plan.  I am confident that, with the goodwill and co-operation of the unions and of staff of An Post, the board and management of the company will succeed in returning An Post to profitability.  I will, of course, keep in close contact with An Post and will monitor very closely the implementation of the plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospect of goodwill on the part of the workforce and indeed the public at large is very unlikely in view of the wide-sweeping draconian measures proposed in the so-called plan for the reorganisation of the postal services.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not recognise that in essence, the plan will involve the tearing out of the heart of rural communities? Can he say whether these proposals were discussed or made known to the social partners in the negotiations on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> or are they now being foisted on the workforce by him on his arrival in his new portfolio?  Would the Minister comment on whether he accepts that the 1983 Act, in spirit, recognises a wider function than merely a commercial mandate to An Post?  Furthermore, does he recognise that he has a role to play in the maintenance of the postal services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister not agree that the delivery of post is something more complex than the selling of apples and oranges; that perhaps it is time we now <Col N="2138" /> re-examined at the tenure of the chairman and board in view of the disaster now being encountered by An Post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>An Post clearly need substantial modernisation.  As I said, I will be monitoring the implementation of the plan to ensure there is the least possible damage done to the social fabric of various parts of the country.  Obviously I would like to see the plan implemented in a sensitive, phased and orderly manner.  I understand from An Post that their plans are to deal with this matter over a period, that, at this stage, they are not seeking compulsory redundancies but rather are inviting a number of post offices to submit their retirement, as it were&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I might also advise the Deputy that a group representative of my Department, of the Department of Social Welfare and An Post has been established to ensure that any potential inconvenience to social welfare recipients &mdash; to which I will be particularly sensitive &mdash; is minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy McCartan the Minister said there would be no compulsory redundancies.  I would suggest to the Minister that they will be unable to do so by virtue of the fact that their workers are protected under the provisions of the 1983 Act.  Is the Minister aware that, at this very moment, there are in existence draft proposals for a Green Paper by the EC on cohesion which intends to provide for areas such as Ireland which would be deemed to be disadvantaged.  By virtue of the volume of post to which the Minister referred earlier, I would suggest that we could advance a very good case for this and that there would be funds available for this purpose.  I know it is intended to introduce this Green Paper in March 1991.  Is the Minister so aware?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware also that a problem was created from their very inception <Col N="2139" /> in as much as An Post were promised a sum of £50 million for capital expenditure and for improvement of their plant and equipment whereas, to date, £7 million only have been paid?  In addition, is he aware that there was to be an annual subvention to An Post for a period of three years amounting to a total of £20 million which has not been paid and that, as a result, from their very inception, An Post have been working against the tide, unable to prove viable because they were short-changed by the Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are some EC proposals afoot but I do not believe they will address this particular difficulty.  I am opposed to subsidising An Post in terms of their day-to-day operating losses.  I perceive that they do not have an alternative but to agree to a recovery plan and implement it in as sensitive a manner as is possible.  We must be quite clear about this: within two-and-a-half to three years An Post would be totally insolvent unless we stand behind some form of action.  It is proposed to have serious and thorough discussions with their workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the dismal future for An Post.  He and I have something in common in that we are new to this portfolio; probably he saw this report yesterday as I saw it this morning.  I wonder did the same question occur to him as occurred to me which is: how have things been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that the picture now being painted is of a serious financial crisis, amounting almost to a doomsday situation?  I agree with the Minister that urgent action is now required.  Would he agree that this urgent action is required not only in the interests of An Post, its management and workers, but in the interests of the community in general? Would he accept that, while efficiency and viability are essential, there is a human face to this crisis which cannot be overlooked, that is, the human face represented by the workers of An Post, the 1,500 people likely to lose their jobs <Col N="2140" /> and who will be unable to find alternative employment and the future of rural Ireland in terms of the social difficulties that will be encountered by the closure of these sub-post offices?  Where are the alternative services to be provided?  Who is to replace the postman?</P>

      <P>Indeed.  Unfortunately the pace of modernisation has its effects on staff.  When one starts investing heavily in technology then its obvious impact is on staffing levels.

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that the Minister abandon the spectator's role he envisages for himself and become actively involved rather than continue to look from the sideline because it is a serious problem that must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that part of the problem was that An Post were not allowed develop into the banking area since the person supposed to be their chief executive, Mr. Tom Garvey, had the idea of expanding into the banking area and would have had a branch in every village in the country?  Unfortunately that idea was not taken up, I would suggest, simply because the Government would not allow it be developed.  I contend that, had An Post been allowed become involved in that activity, it would have provided the requisite revenue and rendered the company profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that one of the principal contributory factors to the losses incurred by An Post was that the Government themselves reduced their usage of the services of An Post by something of the order of £16 million per annum?  Second, is it not the case that the plan proposed by the board of An Post has been on the Minister's desk for over a month, that his predecessor did nothing about it?  Would the Minister not consider it to have been a more prudent approach to have asked the board of An Post to delay announcing the plan until he, the new Minister, had had a fuller opportunity to examine it and direct An Post in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2142" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should make it clear in relation to the proposals and the stated intentions of the board of An Post, that they will now commence a thorough and full round of discussions and offers in the organisation.  Under the Act to which I referred earlier, the board have a commercial mandate.  It is not appropriate for a Minister to try to run the company on a day to day basis.  It is important that I make that distinction.  I have undertaken to monitor this closely, to take particular account of the social and human side and if I have suggestions to offer from time to time I will not be too slow to offer them.</P>

Many of the activities of An Post are social services and it would be impossible to expect them to subsidise those social services out of profit.  Would the Minister not agree that the State has an obligation to provide a sum of money which should be specified in the accounts of the company, as the cost of the social service to An Post?  Would the Minister not agree that it is essential for the commercial life of this country that we have a proper postal service?

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to speak on the budget. I understand that most of what anybody could say about it has already been said. I am taking this opportunity to refer to the problems of An Post.  I tried to get in on the Private Notice Question but was unable to do so.  I want a message to be delivered, loud and clear, to the management of An Post.  Whatever way they balance their books &mdash; and I assume it has to be done for economic reasons &mdash; I do not expect rural Ireland to be asked to carry the can in an uneven and unfair way.  The services at present available to elderly people in remote areas must continue to be made available, although perhaps in a different context.  Let nobody go away with the idea that a green postbox positioned at the head of any townland or village road will suffice as a service in rural Ireland.  There is no reason any person should have to travel two or three miles to find out if somebody has written to him, and that is what is proposed.  I hope this gets back to the chairman of An Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2191" /> I was listening to the Taoiseach today indulging himself and praising himself to the high heavens in relation to the budget.  He seemed to be extremely pleased with it.  Whatever problems we had the day before the budget we still have them a week later.  The economic outlook is not rosy.  Growth in the economy is slowing down and there are no real signs that interest rates will decrease. Why are interest rates so high when our inflation rate is so low?  High interest rates hugely diminish our competitive position in the market and new projects are particularly vulnerable.</P>
    <P>In his euphoria in informing the world of progress to date, the Minister for Finance last week did not significantly draw attention to the fact that we still owe just over £25 billion and the budget has increased that figure.  Unemployment figures are rising rapidly.  The sharp rise of over 8,000 persons signing at employment exchanges last month is likely to continue, particularly over the next few months.  Departments of Social Welfare and Labour officials around the country tell me that out of every ten persons being interviewed for a place on a FÁS training scheme or unemployment assistance, at least four or five had been in the United Kingdom or other countries before Christmas and did not go back.  The news coming from the building sites in the United States and the United Kingdom is equally depressing, with very little work this month and no great sign of any lift-off in the building industry for this year.  Figures from regional airports around the country confirm the assertion that many of our emigrants have returned.  Many passengers purchased a one-way homeward-bound ticket this Christmas.  There is a grave under-estimation in the social welfare provision for 1991 and nobody will be surprised if a hefty Supplementary Estimate is introduced later this year.</P>
    <P>The aspirations in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, an inter-grated approach, planned development of the economy, industrial peace and <Col N="2192" /> input by the social partners are all laudable objectives.  However, three major groupings &mdash; the unemployed, low-paid workers and farmers &mdash; came out very poorly from the negotiations on the programme. The budget highlighted this fact.  A point which seems to have been missed is that between the date of publication of the Estimates and before the budget was announced there was a reduction in the subhead for FÁS training schemes in the Department of Labour Estimate.  This reduction amounted to £3 million.  I consider this to be most unusual and regrettable.  I am informed by officials in FÁS and the Department of Labour that because of this cutback there will be fewer places for FÁS participants this year than last year.  I have always been an advocate of the concept of the social employment scheme, which was started some years ago by the then Coalition Government and continued by this Government.  To have a job on a week-on week-off basis is the nearest thing many people will get to work in the strict sense, especialy for a person who may not have been working for perhaps eight or ten years.  I am baffled at a time when we talk about job creation that this should have happened.</P>
    <P>The other area in which there was supposed to be job creation potential was the integrated rural development sector; so we were told by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The Estimate provided for £11 million as opposed to £1 million last year, but that Estimate was raided a few days before the budget and £5 million was taken out.  I know that Governments do not really create jobs, they create the environment for others to create jobs, but the area within the direct remit of the Government seems to have been raided. I hope that the unemployed and the low-paid will understand what is happening. The poor and the underprivileged will always be at the bottom of the pile, irrespective of what Government are in office.</P>
    <P>Quoting figures from the total social welfare budget can hide great human suffering. The short term unemployed have a weekly income of £45.  Any person who has to live for a week on that sum is not <Col N="2193" /> in a great position and those seven days must be very long.  I know some people who would have no difficulty in paying £45 for one meal.  A married couple with three children in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance get £109 per week.  It would be very difficult for that family to become excited about this budget or the previous budget.  There are no credits, no hidden extras, no opportunities to indulge in spending sprees or play the stock market when a family of five have to live on £105 per week.  The relative well being of the economy, the competitiveness of industry, the effects of GATT on agriculture, educational opportunities and the debate on Irish neutrality all seem a pale shade of yellow when you have little money and less hope.  Human nature and sheer economics will dictate that the unemployed and the poor will be at the bottom of the pile.</P>
    <P>There are many more people at work than on the dole and we must make progress in that direction.  However, workers are over-taxed and the budget did absolutely nothing to reform the tax system, a matter which has been debated at length. Many workers at all levels ruefully look at the tax deductions from their pay packets and they genuinely believe that they are carrying social welfare recipients on their backs.  This is the general perception.  I have to accept that there are some dole spongers, people who play the system, some recipients draw the dole and work at the same time.  I have heard the Minister for Social Welfare criticise rogue employers who do not make their PRSI contributions.  However, I understand amending legislation is to be introduced. All these factors make unnecessary demands on social welfare funding. There is always a need to clamp down on those individuals to ensure that deserving cases are targeted properly.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers bitterly complain about their tax deductions but this is a relative matter.  The man who believed he could not be poorer when he did not have shoes to wear changed his mind when he saw a man without legs.  So-called Christian societies must make adequate provision <Col N="2194" /> for the very young, the unemployed, the low-paid, the deserted, the handicapped and the elderly.  The emphasis the Government put on their caring responsibilities is sometimes a mirror image of the attitude a nation has to those dependent on social welfare.  A family on long term social welfare finds it difficult to see this caring approach by the Government or by vast numbers of the population. The Government are quick to state that their contribution to the less well off keeps pace with inflation or surpasses it. This is a relative judgment also.  A 4 per cent increase on a salary of £20,000 is £800, while a 4 per cent increase on a social welfare payment of £52 is just over £100 a year.</P>
    <P>The effort by the Minister for Social Welfare to help the carers of the elderly is nothing short of pathetic.  There were problems with the prescribed relative's allowance, the forerunner of the carer's allowance.  Of course the decision to pay the carer direct was a good one.  What was not good was the impression given by the Minister that all people caring for the aged could expect to get financial assistance.  Let me outline to the House those who will not get such assistance &mdash; a carer with more than £2 a week income and spouses who have a joint income which is above £90.  There are some slight changes in the budget but those are the basic figures.  This scheme is a farce and the few changes made in the budget will do little to extend the scheme to deserving cases.  Just imagine the chaos that would arise if even a small fraction of the elderly now looked after at home were placed in health board geriatric homes around the country.  Besides the fact that each bed costs £300 or more per week there are just no spaces available. However, people, particularly women, who dedicate their lives or give their already over-burdened time to looking after the elderly, are now snubbed by the constraints of the carer allowance eligibility rules.</P>
    <P>The glib answer to such families is that the services of the district nurse or home help are there.  That is not good enough. We had a bit of that at Question Time on <Col N="2195" /> health today.  It appears that the health boards are so strapped for money and place such low mileage barriers on the travel of district nurses that this service is greatly curtailed.  It is the same with the home help.  The services are excellent but the home help is only around for a very short period.  It is no harm to dwell for a short moment in this House on all the other hours, the 23 hours per day, the seven days per week, 52 weeks a year that the carers of elderly and sick people have to put in.  Because of the love and affection they have for family members they are prepared to go to the ends of the earth, to deny themselves everything to ensure that the people in their care are well looked after.</P>
    <P>I know it is a competition for available funds.  There is no point in my coming in here today and saying that every single person in the country who looks after their aged parents should be paid to do so.  I am not suggesting that at all, but there is huge leeway to be made up on this.  It will be very important in the next year to have a new set of guidelines so that if people find themselves in a position that is beyond them the State is prepared to lend a helping hand, and that it is not a handout but hand up.  It would cost £300 or £400 of the State's money to keep a person in a geriatric home.  There seems nothing wrong with ensuring that most people would get at least £48 or £50 to look after them at home.  It makes reasonable sense.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement is a concept everybody likes.  I believe it is an important concept in that it is there to help people on low wages.  I have not time to go into the anomalies that even the latest increases in the budget have produced but it is something we will go into when the Social Welfare Bill comes into the House.</P>
    <P>There are a few other things that this House and the Government will have to look into very carefully because of changing times in rural Ireland.  If the MacSharry proposals get through, and even if they do not, with the downturn in world prices we will hear a lot more about <Col N="2196" /> rural poverty.  At the moment there are about 14,000 smallholders drawing unemployment assistance.  Unfortunately the figures from all the agencies in the agricultural arena suggest that that number will double if not treble inside the next few years.</P>
    <P>This brings me to an important point about the family income supplement.  As I said, I like the concept of it but it will obviously have to be honed so that it can help genuine cases of families caught in the poverty trap.  What I cannot understand is why people who are self employed, who run into hard times and have no trouble in convincing the Revenue Commissioners that they have almost no income to live on &mdash; I am talking about the self employed and small farmers &mdash; should not be entitled to the family income supplement just as is any other low paid worker.  It is something that will have to be looked at.  We may believe in the oft quoted concept of keeping the greatest number of farming families in rural Ireland on the land but obviously they will not stay there in dire poverty.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that £1 million was being made available specifically for low income farmers.  Despite my best efforts over the last week I cannot get anybody to tell me where that will come from, who it will be paid to and under what criteria it will be distributed.  Anyhow, at £1 million, it must be very restrictive.</P>
    <P>In the few moments at my disposal I want to refer briefly to the agricultural scene.  Obviously the Minister for Agriculture has lost his bearings altogether because in a most embarrassing outburst last week, he had to accept that the decrease in farm incomes last year was not as he said, 6 per cent or 7 per cent, but more like 15 per cent.  I would have thought it was 20 per cent; there are many farmers who certainly had their income reduced by at least 25 per cent.  There was nothing in the budget to help them and, worse, the influence we used to have in Brussels in agricultural matters seems to have scattered to the four corners of the earth.  Now we are told what will happen and can only react to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2197" /> Finally, all I can say is God help the 40,000 or 50,000 Irish farmers if there is no more help for them than what we have seen on the Floor of this House on budget day.  I fully understand that budget day in Ireland may not have all the answers for the farming community because of the Brussels extension but, believe me, there are many people who are genuinely concerned at the lack of consideration, sympathy and, above all else, a plan of action to try to overcome the horrendous problems besetting agriculture at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to be able to speak in the budget debate today.  We all try to combine our economic forecasts and thoughts on issues for which we are responsible.  The Irish economy has gone from a state of virtual collapse in 1987 to a situation where the growth over the last two years was about 10 per cent, among the best in Europe, and that figure is outstanding viewed from any standpoint. The annual inflation up to November 1990 was 2.7 per cent, the second lowest in the EC.  In 1990 there were 22,000 more in employment than there were in 1989.  All of these achievements have come about not by chance but as a result of the Government's sound economic and fiscal policies.  What we are planning is a sustainable path which will lead to greater improvements and full economic stability. The real indication of the success of those policies is that the Exchequer borrowing requirement fell to 2 per cent of GNP compared with 13.6 per cent of GNP in 1986.  That is an amazing précis of how far we have come in the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time as creating a climate for economic growth and development the Government with the consensus of <Col N="2198" /> the social partners, initiated major programmes of social reform &mdash; in the taxation system, in health, in social welfare and in education.  Progress has been made in all of these areas with a view to removing inequities in society.</P>
    <P>This Government clearly recognise that the education sector plays a vital role in modern society, indeed, education holds the key to our success as a nation. On it depends the future of our young people and the quality of life in our society.</P>
    <P>Indeed the potential contribution which education can make to the economic, technological, social and cultural development of a country cannot be over-estimated. It prepares young people for their future roles as responsible citizens as well as producing qualified and skilled personnel to meet the demands of the labour market.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreed recently by the Government with the social partners stresses the key role the education sector play in this country's economic and social progress.  It spells out in clear, unambiguous terms the overall strategy for education, namely, to provide the opportunity for all to develop their educational potential to the full, to learn how to live as fully as possible.  In Ireland we have always shown a great regard for individuality and respect for freedom of expression and choice.  All persons should have the opportunity to prepare themselves to the best of their abilities to make a living and to have a choice of vocation.  We need to develop our human resources as fully as possible.  We need to develop and cultivate the potential talents and aptitudes of all our people.</P>
    <P>For continued economic growth we will have to depend more than ever and more than on any other factor, on the development of the knowledge and skills of our own folk.  A well educated and skilled workforce is essential for new areas of growth such as the financial services sector, which is growing apace, micro-electronics, information technology, mariculture, food processing, horticulture and tourism, all of the areas <Col N="2199" /> to which the Government have directed special attention and resources because of their potential for growth and development.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have a good education and training infrastructure.  Going back over various Governments across the party lines there has always been, thankfully, an emphasis on education.  We want to build on this infrastructure to develop and improve the quality of our education. We want to encourage all our young people to fully avail of the opportunities to develop their innate abilities.</P>
    <P>This budget provides a gross allocation of £1,416 million for the education group of votes.  It is the largest allocation for education services ever made in any of our budgets.  It is a formidable figure, let me repeat it again, £1,416 million. It clearly indicates the importance this Government attach to maintaining and improving the level and quality of education.  The resources now being committed will enable us to respond to the current needs and to adapt and reform to meet the challenges which exist.</P>
    <P>The new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> outlines the strategy for education and provides an opportunity for agreeing on educational policy to the end of the century.  As we know, the programme is based on a strategy for a decade and thus involves the planning process which is particularly suited to education.  The overall education sector is addressed comprehensively in the same programme.  It confirms that the overall strategy in education &mdash; to provide the opportunity for all to develop their educational potential to the full &mdash; will be achieved by having a broad based education for all, by encouraging pupils to continue in full time second level education for as long as they can, by providing post-secondary education for all, by intensifying efforts to cater for those with difficulties and under achievers, by providing second chance education and facilitating mature students to upgrade their knowledge and skills.</P>
    <P>Particular attention in the programme <Col N="2200" /> is given to the socially and educationally disadvantaged.  This recognises that, despite the egalitarian nature of our education a system with its existing schemes to assist the disadvantaged, there are still young people who are suffering from being educationally and &mdash; or socially disadvantaged.  Priority must be given to them.  We must target them especially.  I am very pleased to say that within the past three years and particularly in the future the main thrust of the development in education will be for those who for one reason or another have missed out at any level and now require special attention.  It is a hallmark of our maturity as a country that we clearly recognise this and that we want to direct in a very focused way our resources on education.</P>
    <P>There must be early identification of children suffering educational or social disadvantages.  There must be definite measures taken to support them through guidance and counselling, remedial teaching and the development of home and school links.  Those with disabilities should have full access to learning opportunities that develop their talents and broaden social participation.</P>
    <P>For early school-leavers who have left the education system with perhaps no attainments we will put measures in place also.</P>
    <P>In the area of curriculum planning and reform, I will be giving the new National Council for Curriculum and assessment under its new chairman, Dr. Tom Murphy, the task of revising the primary curriculum and of continuing the updating of the junior and senior cycle programmes. I am sure the House will join with me in expressing our appreciation to Dr. Tom Murphy, a distinguished educationalist, for the work he did on the <i>Primary Education Review Body.</i> It is recognised now as the bible for primary education.  I will be circulating it to all Members of the House together with my plan for the implementation of it.  The Government are pleased that Dr. Tom Murphy has agreed to act as Chairman of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and I will take this <Col N="2201" /> opportunity to pay tribute to Dr. Edward Walsh, the previous chairman of that board.</P>
    <P>The issues and measures outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> require careful planning for their successful development and implementation.  The primary and post primary policy units established in my Department have been given specific responsibilities for formulating, developing and co-ordinating the strategies and creating the conditions necessary for their implementation.  Through the special measures in this year's budget I will be able to initiate action for the disadvantaged in a number of specific areas.</P>
    <P>In primary education emphasis will be placed on developing a number of ongoing initiatives and will focus particulary on the improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio.  It will be reduced to 25:1 in primary schools by September 1992 by retaining all of the existing posts, which is innovative, particularly in the light of demographic changes, and by creating 250 new posts in 1991 followed by further posts in 1992.  The lower pupil-teacher ratio will have as its objective the reduction of overly large classes while expanding the focus on all aspects of the disadvantaged in urban and rural schools. It will attempt to look at the issue of remedial teaching, the requirements in special schools and initiatives related to the integration of children with handicaps in ordinary schools where appropriate. There will be increased funding for the scheme for aid for school books in primary schools.  In the past this scheme provided financial assistance towards the purchase of school books for certain pupils in first to sixth class.  This year, for the first time I am extending the scheme to provide assistance to necessitous pupils in infant classes and increasing the funding overall by 25 per cent.  We are developing special programmes and measures to assist schools in disadvantaged areas and I hope to strengthen my initiative of last year, the home-school liaison scheme.  This scheme was <Col N="2202" /> greatly expanded last year by the provision of a special fund and we will continue with this again this year.</P>
    <P>At this point I wish to refer to the allegations concerning the pupil-teacher ratio made in this House on Tuesday evening, 5 February by the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Dick Spring.  In the school year 1986-87 when Deputy Spring was the Tánaiste in the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, the pupil teacher ratio was 26.7:1 at primary level.  This point may seem academic and minute, and I am quite aware of that, but it was a clear untruth and I want to put on record that Deputy Spring said that <i>inter-alia</i>, even with the improvements coming in in September, the pupil-teacher ratio would be higher than when Labour and Fine Gael were in Government.  Not alone will it be much lower but right now it is lower than when he presided as Tánaiste in that Government.  So often people think one should let remarks like that go without comment.  It is necessary, when the Deputy made such a dogmatic statement that I refute it.  In refuting it and giving the figures, I should like to say to Deputy Spring &mdash; lest he accuse me again of sleight of hand &mdash; that he is welcome to my Department, to my Secretary and to my files in terms of any knowledge he may wish to gain from any section of the Department where he can verify the facts.  This year before any of the improvements come into effect, the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools is 26.5:1.  That is lower than the figure which obtained when the Deputy was in office for four years, and this figure will be even further improved to 25:1 following the programme reductions which were announced.</P>
    <P>In the post-primary sector the facts are as follows.  In 1986-87 the pupil-teacher ratio was 17.07:1.  Following the implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> this figure will be 16.6:1.  It is necessary that I make those facts clear.  The House will note that the position outlined by Deputy Spring is not true; it is a fabrication; it is waffle.</P>
    <P>In post-primary education, action will <Col N="2203" /> be initiated in 1991 in relation to the pupil-teacher ratio and many other factors.  The book library fund is being increased for necessitous students by 10 per cent to £2.6 million and over one-third of all second level pupils will benefit. Design and implementation of strategies and interventions aimed at improving the retention rates of pupils from disadvantaged areas will be initiated.  I have created a special fund to finance research efforts, special targeting of areas, schools and pupils, home school linkages and linkages between targeted schools and third level institutions.  The Youthreach scheme and the vocational preparation and training programmes will be monitored, evaluated and further developed in 1991.  A national system of certification and assessment for these and other vocational training programmes will be introduced and I have allocated funds for its development.</P>
    <P>In recent years there have been significant increases in the number of students entering third level education. About £300 million, or 21 per cent of our budget, goes on higher education.  Major developments are provided for in that area in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The number of third level places will be increased under a programme approved by Government in 1990, in the period 1990-93.  Funding is provided to generate a number of extra places.  I will be introducing amending legislation to provide for the merging of Thomond College with the University of Limerick.  This is a happy merger and is a great step forward in our educational thinking and how we approach matters.  This and the utilisation of spare capacity in the colleges of education for primary teachers through linkages with the universities will provide 1,500 places.  The Tallaght Regional College is progressing very satisfactorily under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>We are also looking at the higher education grant scheme.  Last year I removed the anomaly relating to the number of honours, and the benefits that <Col N="2204" /> have been recommended and much appreciated.  We hope to have more equitable income assessment criteria, to increase income eligibility limits for families with more than one child attending third level courses, to assess the income eligibility for mature students, and to regard mature students who satisfy the income eligibility criteria as qualifying for grants provided they obtain places on approved courses.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House, across party lines, agrees that education is central to all of us but, in particular, to this Government's plan for the future.  This budget and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> give ample expression of this objective and I commend the endorsement of both to the country at large.</P>

      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): B'fhéidir nach raibh mé ag éisteacht i gceart is b'fhéidir go raibh sí ag caint faoi rudaí nach raibh suim agam iontu.  Pé scéal é, dúirt sé gur thug siad ardú pá i bhfad níos mó ná an foilsciú.

Dúirt an tAire Sláinte ar rud céanna tráthnóna inniu.</P>
      <P>There has to be a stop somewhere.  If we go back to 1740 when this House was built people were paid £3 a year for working very hard on this House and the real experts got £13 per year.  If we go back far enough we can have thousands and thousands of a percentage increase in every Department.  There is such a thing as an increase in salaries each year and there is also inflation each year.  If we did not have a larger increase next year than we had this year, we would automatically have a serious cutback. When I hear Ministers telling us that their Department have more money this year than ever before and there was never as much money spent, it means nothing.  It is another form of public relations, and, as I said as Gaeilge, this Government are getting away with absolute murder when it comes to PR.</P>
      <P>The other two Ministers told us how well off they were, and how one had amnesia and forgot to mention that if he did lower inflation in one area he increased it in the other.  This sounds extremely well, and I am sure Ministers are happy to announce it on television but, as I said to the Taoiseach one day, despite the polls, which he now believes because they suit Fianna Fáil, at ground level that is not the feeling.</P>
      <P>I am looking forward to the local elections. It would be real cowardice not to hold them; I presume the party would not accept that type of accusation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education who has just left the House dealt with Education, a sector in which I am interested.  I genuinely welcome the promise to increase the number of teachers.  I believe this promise will be kept by the Government. Since I became a Member of this House I have continually made the point that the present pupil-teacher ratio does not give children a chance.  I am sure I cannot name names in the House but I want to refer to a morning radio show which is <Col N="2206" /> hosted by a very well known personality. He has often said that he tries to keep discussions on a level playing pitch.  I accept that statement.  Yet I have heard some of the comments he has made about teaching.  I do not deny that there are bad teachers, just as there are bad TDs, bad stenographers, bad advisers and bad reporters.</P>
    <P>Someone wrote into this radio programme asking why parents do not get together to do something about teachers. I believe the vast majority of parents are happy with the teachers who are teaching their children but it is regrettable when a child has to spend one year, not to mention three years, with a teacher who is not up to standard for several reasons.</P>
    <P>I have referred previously to early retirement.  Some people who enter teaching at 19 years of age may, through ill health or for other reasons, not be suitable for teaching.  There should be a way out for such people, more for the sake of the children than for anyone else, in the form of early retirement.</P>
    <P>Some of the experts believe the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio will be a bonanza for teachers.  We should put the children of the nation first, as they will be the ones who will gain from a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.  I was a teacher for over 30 years and I do not think I ever had fewer than 37 pupils in my class.  If I was teaching a class of 26 pupils, it was the children who would gain most.  A teacher has to work flat out no matter how many pupils there are in a class and a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio will only mean that a teacher will have a better chance of helping those children who are slow learners.  If there is a large number of children in a class a teacher will have to try to cater for the average ones.  If I regret anything in my career it is that I did not give more time to those children who were slow to learn. However, I had the impossible task of teaching together very clever students, those in the middle stream and the weaker ones.</P>
    <P>The ideal size class in a primary school is one with 25 pupils.  Even though it is claimed that the pupil-teacher ratio is <Col N="2207" /> 26:1 or 28:1 these figures mean nothing because they are arrived at by including all principals, including walking principals, and teachers in one and two teacher schools.  Therefore, the figures given of the average pupil-teacher ratio are artificial.  There are still thousands of children in classes of over 40 pupils.  It is very difficult for a teacher to deal with that number of children.  Unless a teacher is a walking genius the pupils do not get the attention they need.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the ones who will gain from a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio will be the children.  That is as it should be.  There is no point in pretending that teachers who have fewer than 30 pupils in their class can light a cigarette, put their feet up and wait until 3 p.m. to head home.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the need for remedial teachers.  Because of the number of disadvantaged areas in Dublin there is a danger that the vast majority of remedial teachers will be located in schools here. There are children in country schools who also need help.  The school in which I worked shared a remedial teacher with another school.  This system should be availed of more by country schools.  Rural children deserve the same crack at the whip as city children.  In view of the fact that there are so many young teachers available more remedial teachers should be appointed.  This may cost money but it would give children the greatest chance they can get, that is, the chance to be educated to the best of their ability. Smart children can survive almost in spite of teachers but children who are slow need help.  The Minister for Education should make more remedial teachers available for rural children who have difficulty in learning.  Such children are disadvantaged by nature itself and I ask her to increase the number of remedial teachers available.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the social welfare area at present.  The Minister for Finance emphasised the importance of getting our national debt under control. Last year the Treasury Management <Col N="2208" /> Agency, a body of select intelligent people, were set up to try to renegotiate our loans, get better value for money and make cutbacks.  The Minister hopes that this will lead to a saving of £40 million next year.  I accept that our national debt is an awful burden on us.  Seventy-five per cent of our income tax goes to repay this debt.</P>
    <P>I started my contribution by saying that this is a PR Government.  When Deputy Garret FitzGerald was brave enough in 1981-82, and he was working against all the odds and not getting any support from the Opposition, to talk about the national debt he was labelled a monetarist, a Thatcherite, a book-keeper and a man who had no feelings.  It seems okay now to talk about the problems of the national debt and how it must be got under control but no one calls the present Taoiseach a monetarist or a Thatcherite.  I do not know what has happened in the meantime. There was a time when you could not pull up behind a motor car which did not have a sticker stating &ldquo;Axe the tax&rdquo;. However, for some strange reason no one seems to care about this now.</P>
    <P>When I was a Senator I supported a motion in the Seanad which called for the removal of VAT on hurleys.  I have been a member of the GAA all my life and I believed that hurleys were very expensive and should be made as cheap as possible. Even though my party were in power at that time I supported that motion.  This was such a serious topic at the time that Ministers were not invited to Croke Park to see the All Ireland finals.  However, that issue does not seem to matter now. As I have said, there does not seem to be any difficulty now in ignoring what were regarded as problems in the past.</P>
    <P>We have been told that this is the best Government ever but I wonder on what standards they are judged.  The same problems exist now for people who are waiting to get into hospital as existed in 1987 when the then Minister Mr. Barry Desmond, made an attempt to rationalise the health service.</P>

      <P>Deputy Eamon Gilmore has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the dispute at RTE which has led to the indefinite suspension of the orchestras.  The Deputy has five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Last Friday the entire membership of the two RTE orchestras were indefinitely suspended.  The musicians have now balloted for strike action and I understand that the strike proper is due to take place shortly.  I do not propose to deal with the issues involved in this dispute but to talk about the causes and the consequences of the dispute.</P>
      <P>The cause of this dispute arises directly from the Broadcasting Act which was put through this House by the Government last summer. We warned at the time that areas of RTE activity, such as the orchestras, would be affected by that legislation. Already the RTE Chamber Choir has been disbanded and I fear that this dispute is the beginning of the end for the two RTE orchestras.  The working conditions which RTE are now seeking to impose on the musicians will destroy the orchestras, cut off employment opportunities for young musicians and greatly damage the future of music here. Top class musicians, such as those we are proud to have in the National Symphony Orchestra and the RTE Concert Orchestra, will not tolerate such conditions. Gradually, many of them may leave, they may be snapped up by orchestras in other countries and the result will be a greatly diminished National Symphony Orchestra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inter-changeability of musicians between one orchestra and the other which RTE are seeking, and which is at the centre of this dispute, will directly cut off the main employment opportunities for young musicians here.  Young <Col N="2210" /> musicians have generally relied on the casual vacancies which arise from time to time in either of the two orchestras for their initial experience of working in a large principal orchestra.  Unfortunately, if those opportunities are cut off the employment opportunities for those musicians will also be cut off.  It would be a great tragedy if this year, when Dublin is European culture capital, was marked by the decimation of one of our most prized cultural resources, the two orchestras in RTE.</P>
    <P>At this stage of an industrial dispute it is not normal to ask a Government Minister to intervene but there are a number of compelling reasons why the Minister should do so.  First, if the suspension of the orchestras continues indefinitely and if the all-out strike which is threatened takes place, it may well be too late at a later stage to intervene and cause the dispute to be resolved in a way which would maintain the orchestras.  I fear that if the suspensions continue and the dispute escalates, the future for the orchestras will be very bleak indeed.  I do not think I am in any way exaggerating in saying that.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is a very compelling reason why the Minister should intervene in this dispute at this stage.  The circumstances which have given rise to this dispute arose directly from Government action, from legislation which was put through this House by the Government. At the time the Government said it would not have serious consequences for RTE or their services, despite the fact that the future of the orchestras was one of the areas identified at the time as being in possible danger.  There is an obligation on the Government, and the Minister, who were responsible for introducing the Broadcasting Bill which brought about the circumstances that led to this dispute, to intervene and cause it to be resolved. The Minister should ask RTE to immediately lift the suspension on the musicians, to return to the negotiating table and negotiate a settlement of the issues which are in dispute between the musicians' union, SIPTU, and the management of RTE.</P>

      <P>The dispute involves 11 employees and concerns new working arrangements which would require members of the symphony and the concert orchestras to play together on a number of occasions each year.  The musicians were suspended for three days from Thursday 31 January when they refused to merge for a concert on Friday, 1 February.  Conciliation talks under the Labour Relations Commission were held on Thursday, 31 January to try to reach a settlement, but were unsuccessful. The three-day suspension was then extended to an indefinite suspension which, management say, will not be lifted until the issues in dispute have been resolved.  Further conciliation talks were held on Monday, 4 February, but again without success.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the House that the services of the Labour Relations Commission, the body which have been dealing with this issue over the last week, will continue to be available to the parties at any time and any place.  I would ask both sides to listen to what Deputy Gilmore and I have been saying, to re-examine their position and enter meaningful discussions.  It is unlikely as in all disputes, that either side will collapse; both sides will be required to come back to the negotiating table so that they can resolve the dispute.  The Labour Relations Commission will remain on stand-by to help with the parties in their difficulties and will be glad to assist them in any way they can.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Browne (<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>), has been given permission to raise the subject matter of Question No. 28 of 26 November which related to car lights that cannot be dimmed, with consequent danger to road users at night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): Go <Col N="2212" /> raibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I have twice put down questions to the Minister regarding the standard of car lights.  On the first occasion, in 1989, he told me he was unaware that any problem existed and said if I knew of any to let him know.  When I asked him in 1990 what the position was he informed me that there was no change from his previous answer.  It may be the streak of jealousy in me that makes me wonder if that is due to his advantage of being chauffeur driven to the west of Ireland and not having to look at lights.</P>
      <P>On any given night seven out of every ten on-coming cars have lights that are going in all directions except the left hand side of the road.  It is only the grace of God that people are not killed in those blank spots when drivers can see absolutely nothing.  I have been told that the cheap lights imported from the East cannot be focused, and that is one of our main problems.  Another problem is that we are not concerned about the condition of car lights.  We take it for granted that once they come on they are all right.  The Minister should consider this a serious problem.  More could be done in this area to save people's lives than in many other areas.  In some cases it is obvious that the on-coming driver has dimmed the lights but they have become less glaring.  If everybody ensured their lights were working properly people would have more comfort when driving.</P>
      <P>Another problem is caused by what I would term the eunuch coming along who, when he dims, has only one light and one does not know what side of the road he is on.  The Minister should consider this matter more seriously than to reply by saying that there is no problem as far as he is concerned.  I sincerely hope that as a man from the midlands, he will give me an answer which will show that this is seen in a very serious light and that there are plans in hand to prevent further deaths on the road because of lights which blind people.</P>

      <P>In reply <Col N="2213" /> to Deputy Browne's parliamentary question at the end of 1989, the Minister for the Environment invited him to submit details in support of these representations about the importation of unsuitable headlamps from Eastern Europe.  To date, the Minister has not received the relevant details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I also understand that the Department have not received further representations on this subject from any source.  If the Deputy supplies details, the Minister will consider what action may be appropriate.</P>
      <P>As mentioned to the Deputy previously, the road traffic regulations require headlamps to be so constructed and fitted as to be incapable of dazzling other road users.  Enforcement of these regulations is a matter for the Garda Síochána and they instituted 17,000 prosecutions for motor vehicle lighting offences in 1989.</P>
      <P>The Department believe that the biggest problem in relation to dazzle is caused by failure to dip headlamps for approaching vehicles and by failure to repair damaged headlights which, I am sure the Deputy will agree, is most important because, if the headlight is not working on the right hand side of an approaching car or lorry, it can be extremely dangerous.</P>
      <P>Headlamp aim is the most common defect found in heavy goods, buses and ambulances.  The roadworthiness of buses and ambulances is tested annually. I appreciate the Deputy raising the matter and if he lets me have detailed information I will be glad to have it investigated. I have not received any complaints in regard to dazzle.  The only complaint I have had is in regard to a bulb missing in the lights of a car, lorry or ambulance which, at night, is very dangerous, something that should be rectified immediately.</P>

    <P>The lady was right.  The incident was highlighted in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> this morning and I am raising it here today but my fear is that, in a week or two, the incident will be forgotten by the media, the authorities and me.  That lady, who is frightened and worried, will think of the incident every day and night until the matter is put right.  It will not go away for the residents of that area.  I want to reassure that lady that it will not happen again but I am unable to do so until I get an assurance from the Minister that the cement silo will be moved from that area to a less built up location.  If I do not get that commitment, the people of Lower Glanmire Road and surrounding areas will have been let down by the authorities who are there to protect them.  The silo must be removed.</P>
    <P>Another issue I must raise is the manner in which the silo is managed. There must be extreme carelessness in the management of the silo and it is obvious that management is sloppy and haphazard.  This whole operation must be investigated and I am asking for a departmental inquiry into the handling of the cement complex in Cork.  The local authority, Cork Corporation, were very fast and effective in their response to the incident and their cleaning staff were on site within a short period.  I commend the effectiveness of Cork Corporation. However, legal proceedings should be taken against the responsible company in accordance with the pollution and litter Acts.  There have been incidents of this kind before and it is only by penalising companies that lessons will be learned. Unfortunately, penalties are insignificant compared with the enormity of the incident.</P>
    <P>I wish to state &mdash; in a non-alarmist fashion &mdash; that cement dust is toxic. Therefore, there is a responsibility on the Departments to carry out a full and comprehensive survey of the people <Col N="2216" /> affected by the dust yesterday.  It is a responsibility, not only for the Minister present but for the Minister for Health and the Minister for the Environment.  I hope that the Departments of Health, Transport and the Environment will get their act together to deal with this real problem.  It may be insignificant to people in Dublin but it is a constant worry for the people who live with it day in day out in Cork.</P>

      <P>I wish to respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Communications, Deputy Séamus Brennan, to this Adjournment debate.  I understand from Iarnród Éireann that bulk cement is discharged, under air pressure, from rail tanks into the cement silos which are located away from the main passenger platforms and from tracks carrying passenger trains. The silos are located in the best possible positions in the rail yards so as to limit the amount of damage that could occur in the event of any accident that might arise during a discharge.</P>
      <P>Yesterday morning a line of three rail tankers was being discharged at Cork's Kent Station in the vicinity of Lower Glanmire Road.  When two tankers had been discharged a locomotive was brought up to the end of the line of tankers with the intention of hauling away the two empty tankers.  It would appear that the locomotive struck against the tankers, moving them some short distance. This movement broke the hose pipe carrying cement into the silo.  Unfortunately the air pump continued to operate and consequently cement was blown into the surrounding atmosphere.  Within seconds of this happening the air supply was cut off and no further discharge occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to stress that there was no health hazard involved in the discharge and that there were no injuries as a result of the accident.  With regard to previous discharges at the location over recent years, I understand that seven were of a relatively minor nature, being confined <Col N="2217" /> to leakage in and around the silo itself and within the confines of Iarnród Éireann property and that two during 1990 resulted in cement being discharged outside Iarnród Éireann property.  No injuries were sustained as a result of any of these incidents.</P>
    <P>I know that when these incidents occur, Iarnród Éireann make every effort to minimise the inconvenience to local residents.  In this context, I am happy to report that in connection with the recent incident, industrial contractors have been engaged to clear the houses of any local residents who have been affected by the discharge and Cork Corporation are also giving very valuable assistance.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann will be carrying out an internal inquiry to establish how the shunting incident occurred.  Based on the initial reports I have received at this stage, it would appear that this accident did not require to be notified to the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications under the notification of accidents order since no passenger lines or passenger trains were involved. However, in view of the regrettable inconvenience caused to the local residents as a result of the accident, I am arranging for the Department's railways inspecting officer to discuss with officers of Iarnród Éireann what actions could be taken to prevent a similar incident in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>On the day when the Birmingham Six case is again before the British Appeal Court, I am raising the case of another Irish prisoner who is serving a sentence in Gartree Prison, England. This prisoner, Michael Bromell, was brought to my attention indirectly by one of the Birmingham Six, Paddy Hill, following a visit I made to the prison some months ago.  Since then Michael Bromell has written to me about his case which he says is being re-examined by the Home Office since April of last year. He states that he was arrested by the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad on <Col N="2218" /> 7 January 1987 and convicted on what he claims to have been concocted confessions and fabricated evidence.  His appeal was dismissed by Lord Woolf in November 1988 who remarked that his allegations about the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad seemed to be almost inconceivable.</P>
      <P>On 24 July 1989, Michael Bromell again formally issued complaints against the serious crime squad and the Chief Constable, Geoffrey Dean, after the intervention of a British Member of Parliament ordered an internal investigation. The Police Complaints Authority supervised this investigation, Mr. Bromell states that the files on the prosecution case which resulted in his conviction then disappeared, presumably stolen from Warwick Crown Court.  Mr. Bromell's case papers remain officially lost.  It was at this time that the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad was disbanded and the West Yorkshire Police called in to conduct an investigation into their activities.</P>
      <P>A linguistic test has since been carried out on the photocopies of the prosecution papers at Mr. Bromell's request and the findings given to the Police Complaints Authority.  The current position is that a decision is awaited from the Home Office as to whether the case will be referred back to the Appeal Court.  I am asking the Minister to make strong representations to the British Home Secretary to bring this case to a swift conclusion.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gregory for bringing this case to the attention of the House for the second time in a week.  The Deputy raised the matter by way of question with the Minister on 30 January.  I would like to repeat some of the Minister's answer.  The position is as Deputy Gregory described. The matter is now with the Home Office who indicated to the embassy earlier this month that this request for a retrial was under active consideration.  However, they said that pending a decision on this issue, they were not in a position to <Col N="2219" /> pursue the question of possible disciplinary charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me again reassure the Deputy and the House that the embassy will continue to stay in very close touch with the citizen involved and with his legal representative and that they will continue to make whatever representations appear necessary in order to promote a very early decision in this case.  I wish to re-emphasise that <Col N="2220" /> since 30 January we have been in touch again with the Home Office about this case and will continue to make strong representations on the matter to the Home Office.  They informed us that they are actively considering his request for an appeal.</P>

I might add that the linkage between unemployment, poverty and psychological distress is well recognised. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for a range of measures in the fields of training, employment, social welfare and health which are specifically designed to come to grips with these problems.  As regards the health services, it is the Government's intention under the programme to continue to give a high priority to measures aimed at promoting positive health.  In addition there <Col N="2146" /> will be a further development of community psychiatric services which are locally based and easily accessible so that problems of psychological distress can be treated as early as possible.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that there are on-going activities conducted by the Health Promotion Unit in both the areas of smoking and alcohol.  In relation to smoking an annual anti-smoking campaign has been conducted by the Health Promotion Unit since their establishment in 1988.  The Deputy will be aware that a major campaign was launched last year to provide information to the public about the introduction of Regulations under the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988 prohibiting <Col N="2147" /> and restricting smoking in public places. On Shrove Tuesday, 12 February, I will be launching this year's anti-smoking campaign.</P>
      <P>Last autumn I launched a Drink Awareness for Youth (DAY) programme which aims to inform and educate young people about alcohol and the dangers associated with its abuse.  It is a prevention programme that seeks to equip young people with the personal and social skills necessary to make responsible decisions regarding their use of alcohol.  This is a joint initiative between the Department's Health Promotion Unit, the National Youth Council and the Department of Education.  The DAY programme is primarily for use in youth settings, and has been completed following its very successful piloting in various youth settings throughout the country.  The programme can also be used in schools.  A nationwide training programme for youth leaders is now underway.</P>
      <P>I also recently launched an alcohol education video titled, <i>Handle with Care</i> which was produced by the Health Promotion Unit, in conjunction with the Catholic Communications Institute and Veritas Video Productions.  The video is aimed at ten to 15 year olds and includes a comprehensive teacher's guide for use in schools.  This will be a very useful way of getting the message across to young people before they actually drink alcohol. It is not about not drinking alcohol.  It is, as the title suggests, about handling alcohol with care.  Both of these alcohol education initiatives were made possible by generous financial assistance from the national lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more broadly based community programme entitled &ldquo;Drug Questions &mdash; Local Answers&rdquo; has also been developed by the Health Promotion Unit to promote a community response to drug problems generally, including those relating to drinking and other drug use.  It brings together health and educational professionals and interested voluntary workers, in their local communities, and places particular emphasis on problems <Col N="2148" /> posed by alcohol abuse.  To date approximately 450 persons have participated in the course throughout the country and the response to its content has been very positive.</P>
    <P>On a wider policy front, a comprehensive national policy on alcohol is being developed under the aegis of the Advisory Council on Health Promotion. This policy is examining the wide range of social, cultural, economic, educational and legal issues involved in alcohol use and abuse as well as examining treatment strategies and services.  The views of interested persons and organisations are being sought on the formulation of this policy.</P>

      <P>The Government will during 1991 announce proposals for improvements in the administration and management of the health services in order to ensure the most efficient and effective use of the available resources and to address the recognised problems in relation to the co-ordination of services in certain areas.</P>
      <P>The Government's proposals will take account of the analysis and recommendations of the committees which have recently examined various aspects of this issue, including the Commission on Health Funding, the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, the Hospital Efficiency Review Group and the Cabinet Sub-Committee and Advisory Expert Committee on Local Government Reorganisation.</P>
      <P>The proposals will be guided by the following general principles:</P>
      <P>... the Minister and Department should be responsible for the development of health policy and the control of expenditure but should not be involved in the detailed management of individual health services.  A performance audit unit will be established in the Department of Health to assist the Minister in assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the health services;</P>

      <P>I am glad to be able to report to the House that the bituminous coal ban has had a definite beneficial clinical effect on respiratory health for patients with problems such as bronchitis and asthma.  Analysis of hospital admissions in the Eastern Health Board area indicates a reduction in admissions for respiratory problems compared to last year.  Medical consultants contacted by my Department have commented on the improvement of their patients this year compared to last year.  There has been a marked decrease in the number of acute asthma attacks and in the necessity for admission for asthmatic and obstructive disease conditions since the coal restrictions were introduced.  In addition, not only has there been a reduction in emergency referrals and presentations but it has also been noticed that those patients with moderately severe asthma tend to be much better controlled.  As a result it has been possible to discharge far more patients to their family doctors, rather than keeping them under review, since there is less smoke in the environment.</P>
      <P>Clearly, a detailed study of respiratory morbidity across the entire city would be needed to give irrefutable scientific proof of this improvement.  Nevertheless there is no doubt in my mind that the virtual absence of smog since the ban on the sale of bituminous coal is largely responsible for these very welcome trends in respiratory complaints.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all concerned with improving our environment.</P>

      <P>The Book of Estimates for 1991 includes a sum of £900,000 under Subhead K for dissemination of Information on Health and Health Services.  Almost all of this money is used by the Health Promotion Unit to support the programmes.  This figure takes no account of salaries and other overheads of the unit.  Neither does it take account of health promotion work <Col N="2155" /> carried out by the individual health agencies.</P>
      <P>The 1991 Subhead K allocation compares very favourably with the 1990 allocation of £750,000 &mdash; an increase of 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Health Promotion Unit receives significant national lottery funding.  This amounted to £300,000 in 1990.  The 1991 national lottery funding for health promotion has yet to be determined. Some funding is also available for health promotion under the EC cancer programme.  The 1991 allocation has not been decided upon to date.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that the Health Promotion Unit provide a very active and comprehensive range of health promotion programmes and the Government's commitment to this area is reflected in their decision to increase the 1991 allocation by 20 per cent.</P>

These discussions centred mainly on the provision of a department of geriatric medicine at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and the replacement of St. Mary's Geriatric Hospital which is in a poor state of repair.  During these discussions the possibility of using the Drogheda Cottage Hospital for the care of long stay patients was raised and some elderly patients have now been transferred there from sub-standard accommodation in St. Mary's.  The health board are renovating and extending the Cottage Hospital at present with a view to providing an extended service for the elderly; the position of St. Mary's Hospital will be considered further at that time.

However, I accept that in the difficult financial situation which has obtained in recent years, it has not always been possible for the health boards to make adequate provision under this heading.

      <P>In my address to Dáil Éireann on 6 February 1990 I outlined a series of measures aimed at improving the efficiency and quality of the health services.  These included the allocation of additional funds for the development of community services, the initiation of efficiency reviews of the delivery of hospital services, the commitment to a radical upgrading of information systems at national and local level and measures to improve management expertise in the health services including the appointment of specialist managers in key areas such as, for example, Cork Regional Hospital.  These measures represented the first step in the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Health Funding.  I also <Col N="2159" /> announced that decisions on the major recommendations of the commission in relation to eligibility and the administration of the health services would be taken when the Government had completed their consideration of the commission's report and of the subsequent consultative process.</P>
      <P>The Government's response to the commission's report has now been taken a stage further with the very significant developments included in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These include, in particular, the commitment to a major programme of development of community-based facilities over a seven-year period; adjustments to the eligibility structure in order to improve equity of access to public hospital care; and detailed proposals to improve the quality of patient care in our hospitals.  The programme also indicates the Government's intention to bring forward proposals in the course of the year on the administration and management of the health services.  In this context, the commission highlighted the central role of information in the future management of an efficient health service, and the development of information technology is receiving priority in the allocation of capital funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2163" /> Waterford Regional Hospital is due for completion in 1993.</P>
    <P>The Ardkeen development was originally planned on the basis of a 600 bed hospital; it was intended to incorporate the services provided at Ardkeen together with the regional orthopaedic unit at Kilcreene, the maternity hospital at Airmount and the child psychiatry and alcoholic unit at Belmont Park.  A revised scheme was drawn up in 1983 which reduced the scheme to 424 beds, omitting both psychiatric and orthopaedic beds.</P>
    <P>The 424 beds to be provided in the new regional hospital include 73 surgical beds, including ten paediatric beds, 83 medical beds, 31 orthopaedic, trauma, beds, 23 gynaecology beds, 56 obstetric beds and 33 ear, nose and throat beds, regional speciality.</P>
    <P>The contract sum for this project was in the region of £36 million.  However, the final cost, because of inflation and other factors, will be significantly greater than this.</P>
    <P>The new regional hospital will be a purpose-built building geared to the needs of the 21st century and providing a service in community specialities for all of County Waterford, part of County Wexford and south County Kilkenny together with services in a number of regional specialities for the entire South-Eastern Health Board area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government are committed to the development of support services for people with mental handicap and their carers in the community.  The need to expand genetic counselling and <Col N="2164" /> speech therapy services in this respect is recognised.</P>
    <P>Plans will be prepared in each health board area to develop mental handicap services which will be implemented in line with the resources made available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>My Department are currently examining the difficulties being experienced in the recruitment of speech therapists and the number of training places is being reviewed with the educational authority.</P>
    <P>The report of a special committee on medical genetics services has been submitted to me and is currently being examined in the Department.  As soon as this examination is complete I will be initiating discussions with the parties who will be involved in the implementation of the proposals in the report.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the health board that the present staffing of the home, which was significantly augmented in 1990, is adequate to meet the needs of the patients at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the personnel policy which applies in the health services, it is a matter for each agency to determine the appropriate staffing level in each of its institutions and other services, within its approved employment ceiling and financial allocation.  Within these overall constraints it would be open to the health board to further improve the staffing level <Col N="2165" /> in the Sacred Heart Home if it felt this to be justified.</P>

      <P>The salary scale for home helps with effect from 1 October 1990 is in the range £158.43-£168.59 per week.  This scale is increased from time to time in accordance with increases granted to non-nursing personnel generally.  An increase of 4 per cent would be applicable from 1 January 1991 in the event of acceptance of the terms of the agreement on pay outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>With regard to persons employed in the home help service on a part-time basis, the position is that the rate of remuneration varies throughout the country and relates to the particular circumstances involved.  The level of remuneration is accordingly reviewed by health boards in the context of the particular requirements and types of tasks undertaken in an individual case.</P>

      <P>Should the person concerned claim unemployment benefit on completion of her studies in May 1991, her entitlement will be determined by reference to her contribution record in the contribution year 6 April 1989 to 5 April 1990.  According to the Department's <Col N="2175" /> records, no contributions have been paid or credited on her behalf for that year and on this basis she would not be entitled to unemployment benefit.  However, investigations are being made to determine whether she should have been awarded credited contributions during this period and I will inform the Deputy of the outcome in due course.</P>
      <P>In the event that she is not entitled to unemployment benefit it is open to her to apply for unemployment assistance which is a means tested payment.</P>
      <P>Persons in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long term rate and over 21 years may participate in full-time second level education courses without losing their entitlement and persons over 23 years may participate in third level courses.  Persons in receipt of unemployment benefit are not entitled to participate in full-time education courses while continuing to claim benefit.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit she is not entitled to any unemployment payment while participating in the course.  If her income is insufficient to meet her needs she may be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance and in this regard she should contact her community welfare officer.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question Nos. 8 <i>et al</i> of 6 February, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An assessment under section 9 of the Housing Act 1988 relates to the number of persons in need of and seeking local authority housing.  This was the basis of <Col N="2179" /> the assessments at 30 September, 1989; homeless persons not seeking local authority housing were not included.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities have now been directed to carry out their next assessment under section 9 to determine the needs at 31 March 1991.  The authorities have been requested to avail of the opportunity presented by the assessment under section 9 to assess separately the level of homelessness in their areas to which they may have to respond, whether by local authority housing or, if such housing is not immediately available, by use of their powers under section 10 of the Act.</P>
    <P>The underspending in the 1989 and 1990 provision for the making of recoupments under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 was due to the fact that the level of claims made by housing authorities fell short of the provision each year.  No expenditure arose in 1988 as section 10 was not brought into operation until 1 January, 1989.</P>
    <P>The housing authorities to which recoupment was made in 1989 and 1990 are those set out in the reply to Question No. 320 of 30-1-91.</P>

      <P>A survey of housing conditions, involving the inspection of a scientifically selected sample of approximately 30,000 dwellings, has now been completed by virtually all local authorities.  The results of the survey will be an important input to the estimates of total housing requirements up to June 1993, which local authorities are now in the process of making for their areas.  No consideration has yet been given to the date of the next such survey.</P>

Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the Department of the Environment are committed to taking special steps to ensure the full implementation of the Act by housing authorities.  My Department are in discussion with the Department of the Environment with regard to the <Col N="2184" /> future role of health boards in this area, particularly in relation to night shelter accommodation.</P>

      <P>The Government are very conscious of the difficulties faced by young homeless persons and are taking a number of initiatives to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>The Child Care Bill which passed all Stages of the House before Christmas contains important new provisions to assist young homeless people.  The Bill, when enacted, will impose a statutory duty on the health boards to promote the welfare of children up to the age of 18 who are not receiving adequate care or protection.</P>
      <P>Of particular relevance is an entirely new section in the Bill requiring the health boards to investigate the circumstances of homeless children and, in appropriate cases, either to receive these children into care or to take steps to make accommodation available for them.</P>
      <P>The Bill will shortly be introduced in the Seanad and, as is indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the Government are committed to providing the additional resources necessary to bring the legislation into operation as soon as practicable after its enactment.  I have set aside a sum of £1 million this year to begin the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of developments aimed at meeting the needs of the young homeless have been initiated.  Particular emphasis has been placed on the problems which <Col N="2185" /> have arisen in the Eastern Health Board area.  Examples of these initiatives include the assignment of a special team of social workers to deal specifically with homeless young people.  This is supported by a centralised crisis accommodation unit; a new community residential project for boys has been established in Tallaght, which provides residential care for boys between 12 and 16 years of age; a similar residential project for girls has been set up in the Ballymun area; a new long term residential unit has been developed in the Clontarf area which caters for boys in the 11 to 14 age group; the setting up by the Eastern Health Board of a new project called &ldquo;Carers for Young People&rdquo; which will cater for adolescents who have had difficulty adapting to other settings; the purchase of a premises near Blessington which will house a therapeutic unit for boys and girls with special difficulties.  This is due to come on stream in the first half of this year; and negotiations are also taking place between the Eastern Health Board and a number of organisations regarding the provision of additional emergency and long term accommodation for both boys and girls.</P>
    <P>Outside the Eastern Health Board area a number of other initiatives for the young homeless are being supported. Approval has recently been given to the Southern Health Board to build a new group home at Shanakiel Road, Cork. Funds have also been made available to the Mid-Western Health Board to develop a new unit for adolescents near Limerick.  Projects in Galway, Tullamore and Sligo for disadvantaged youth are also being supported.</P>

      <P>A sketch plan for the proposed extension to Ballyneale national school has been completed and it will be sent to the school authorities at an early date to enable them to seek local authority planning premission.  In the light of these facts I do not believe that a meeting is necessary at this stage.</P>
