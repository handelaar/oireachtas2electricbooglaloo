      <P>I wish to seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the urgent and important matter of the new revelation of a High Court claim against the B &amp; I Line for $30 million by Ro-Ro Ferries Ltd., Nolan Transport Ltd. and Morefield Ltd., the imminent injunction being sought by these parties against the Government in completing the sale of the B &amp; I Line and the urgent need for the Minister for Transport to clarify to the Dáil the exact liabilities to the Exchequer in the context of the proposed sale of the B &amp; I Line.</P>

      <P>The matter has not arisen suddenly.  It is not likely to develop significantly before the Dáil will in practice have an opportunity of discussing it and it is also <i>sub judice,</i> which I grant.  The matter can be referred to in the ongoing debate on the B &amp; I Line Bill which is before the House and Committee Stage of which has been ordered for next Tuesday.  The <i>sub judice</i> rule does not apply to a Bill which impinges on a matter before the Courts.  I am taking my stand on rulings of my predecessors in this regard &mdash; a motion concerning a matter which is before the courts may not be discussed until the matter is disposed of in the courts but this does not apply to a Bill which impinges on the matter.  In other words, legislation passing through this House is not bound by the <i>sub judice</i> rule.</P>

      <P>May I now ask, in relation to these various proposals, if it is agreed that business be interrupted at 7 p.m. tonight?  Agreed.  Is it agreed that No. 13 be decided without debate? Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing <Col N="1274" /> with the statement by the Taoiseach agreed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to object, not by means of a vote, that there is no equality of time between the party Leaders in this debate.  I also regret that provision has not been made for a ministrial reply to any points made, in view of the fact that parliamentary questions on this subject have been ruled out of order in anticipation of this debate.  There will be no reply to this debate.  Further, it might be appropriate to include a report on the bilaterial meetings the Taoiseach has had with each of the Prime Ministers he has met, not just one, namely, the British Prime Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make two points.  First, the time allocated for this topic is far too short.  I wonder if the Taoiseach would indicate at some stage whether or not he proposes to have a more detailed debate on the conclusions reached at Maastricht.  May I also draw attention to the fact that I have been led to understand by the spokes-persons of the other parties that it is unlikely we will reach this topic until 11.10 a.m.?  This means that no spokesperson for The Workers' Party will be able to contribute to the debate, if it concludes at 12.45 p.m.  I am asking that the time limit of 12.45 p.m. be deleted or that some arrangement be made to ensure that the Government, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party spokespersons get their full time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the intention that The Workers' Party should be denied an opportunity to contribute. There is no such intention.  I suggest that we let the statements go ahead to see how it goes and that we be flexible about the timing.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I hope I did not imply that the Government were trying to stop me from speaking.  I was just pointing out, due to the way business will run this morning, that if the time limit remains as it is and is applied I will not get an opportunity to contribute.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Taoiseach now that there will be some latitude in that regard and that we shall not be confined to 12.45 p.m. The intention is to ensure that all party spokespersons are afforded an opportunity to speak on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday evening the Whips met and agreed on the programme of business for this week.  The Government Whip on Friday, unilaterally, introduced this Bill.  The business of the House cannot progress if the Government ride rough shod over the Opposition in that regard.  We object to the proposal that this Bill be taken now for that reason. It is not good parliamentary practice to come to an agreement on a Thursday afternoon and to throw it aside on the Friday.  No progress will be made in the House if the Government insist on adopting that attitude?  No. 3 is the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill, 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We also object to the proposal that No. 3 be taken in this manner because, as Deputy Barry has correctly outlined, there was no agreement.  It was brought out on Friday.  This is not the way to do business.  At a time when there are 260,000 people unemployed, it is ludicrous to bring in this Bill.</P>

May I ask the Taoiseach, in view of the fact that the President of Ireland has been in office for 12 months and has indicated on a number of occasions a wish to address this House, if the Government would indicate a willingness to make arrangements for such an address?  It would be a very good and unifying act <Col N="1282" /> on behalf of the Government and the country.</P>

      <P>I know the Taoiseach has dealt with this matter and perhaps he feels that he has dealt with it satisfactorily, but it is our democratic responsibility to debate the Estimates in this House.  Is he now in a position to tell the House whether the Estimates will be published on Monday so that a debate can proceed as intended on Wednesday and Thursday?

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of queries for the Taoiseach.  Earlier, I asked whether the Taoiseach proposed to have a more detailed debate on the Maastricht conclusions and if he will indicate when that might take place?  Given that the final legal text will have to be signed by the Heads of State some time in early February and that we are unlikely to resume until the end of January, given normal procedures, I wonder when a detailed debate on this will take place? Will the Taoiseach indicate the date of the budget?  Is it intended to have it earlier then the usual time, at the end of January, or is it proposed to resume earlier in January in order to deal with it? My final point, a Cheann Comhairle &mdash;<Col N="1284" /> if I am not straining your patience too much &mdash; relates to promised legislation. On a number of occasions the Taoiseach promised that the family planning Bill would be dealt with before the Christmas recess but it is now extremely unlikely that it will be introduced next week, although the Taoiseach might surprise me.  Will the Taoiseach indicate the earliest date on which it is intended to deal with that Bill in view of its implications for health?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is probably necessary for the House to have further discussions on the outcome of Maastricht because today we are having the normal statements procedures and there is a great deal of documentation that has to be made available to Deputies.  It is something we will have to consider in the new year.  As the Deputy knows, we will be bringing out a White Paper as soon as possible on the various aspects of the agreement and whether we might wait for that and have our discussion on the basis of the White Paper is a matter that we can consider.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Title>Maastricht Summit: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to make a statement on the European Council which I attended with <Col N="1288" /> Deputy Gerard Collins, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Bertie Ahern, Minister for Finance, in Maastricht on 9 and 10 December.</P>
      <P>Because of the unusually late hour at which the Council finished its work, the Presidency conclusions only became available comparatively late yesterday. As soon as the documents became available, I laid before the House and circulated to party Leaders the texts of the draft Treaty which formed the basis of the discussions at the European Council, the Presidency conclusions, and the documents which set out the agreed changes to the Maastricht Treaty texts.  I will, of course, see that definitive and consolidated texts are provided as soon as we receive them.</P>
      <P>The discussions which have already taken place in this House &mdash; most recently on Thursday and Friday week last &mdash; and replies by the Ministers concerned and myself to Parliamentary Questions, cover well for Deputies the background and the subject matter of the Council.  Essentially, we were discussing in Maastricht the form and content of a Treaty on European Union.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Council was a success. It can be described as historic.  The outcome was that we established a new European union.  It is a political union of the Twelve member states which will have a common foreign and security policy, unified economic and monetary systems, a single market, a charter of social rights, and Community competence in a greatly increased number of important areas.  It will promote a new level of prosperity among the people who belong to it and improve the quality of their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For Ireland the outcome was very satisfactory. We will share fully in the benefits of the new union, and our economic and social interests have been specially favoured and protected.  The Treaty will, therefore, bring an ever closer union among the people of Europe; the promotion of economic and social progress based on free and open competition and the market system; measures to assert the identity of the Community on the <Col N="1289" /> international scene; and strengthening the protection of the rights and interests of the nationals of the member states through the development of the concepts of European citizenship, of cohesion and of social policy.</P>
    <P>The new Treaty we adopted will provide the legal framework for the existence and continued development into the next century of a political entity of 340 million inhabitants, constituting the largest single trading bloc in the world.  It is vital, in my view, that the competences exercised by this union, and its political capacity, should be coherent as between themselves and fully in balance with the economic strength of the union.</P>
    <P>Indeed, we have already seen the potential of the existing Community as a force for democracy and as a continuing source of social and economic stability in Europe.  The challenges facing us are in no way diminishing.  Even as the Council was meeting in Maastricht, news of developments in the USSR lent emphasis to this point.</P>
    <P>The Government will be setting out the proposals in the Treaty and the main considerations affecting Ireland in a White Paper to be published early in the new year.  I should, however, at this point like to assure Deputies that the operation of the Treaty will be governed by the principle of subsidiarity.  This means that the Community will take action in areas which do not fall within its exclusive jurisdiction, only if, and in so far as, these objectives can better be achieved, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, by the Community than by the member states acting separately.</P>
    <P>Much of the work in drawing up the draft Treaty documents has been done by the Intergovernmental Conferences on Economic and Monetary Union and on Political Union, first launched as a joint enterprise during the Irish Presidency in 1990.  The Irish contribution to these conferences has been consistent and sustained.</P>
    <P>I had, before the Maastricht meeting, discussions on matters of bilateral interest or of concern in the Community <Col N="1290" /> context, with the President of the Commission, Mr. Jacques Delors, with the President of the European Council, Mr. Rudd Lubbers, with the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, with Mr. Enrique Baron, President of the European Parliament, and with President Francois Mitterrand.  My discussions with Prime Minister Major also covered Northern Ireland matters.  I have placed copies of the communique issued after that meeting in the Dáil Library.  I also had bilateral discussions, immediately before or in the wings of the Maastricht Council, with Prime Minister Cavaco de Silva of Portugal, and Prime Minister Gonzales of Spain.</P>
    <P>I propose now to outline the issues and major decisions of the Maastricht Council.</P>
    <P>First, on procedures: the Council was addressed, in accordance with what has become the practice, by the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Baron.</P>
    <P>The President of the Council, Mr. Lubbers, set out the agenda which he had previously indicated as covering six major issues.  These are: economic and monetary union, which has for its ultimate aim a single currency for the Community; economic and social cohesion, involving the application of the principle of Community solidarity in the distribution of the economic benefits of the union among the member states and regions; social policy, which has a similar objective in so far as individuals are concerned; foreign and security policy, which will assert the union's identity in the world; the global presidency package concerning the &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo; Community competence and solidarity and the perspective for the future development of the Union &mdash; focusing particularly on the question of how best to continue the process of European integration.</P>
    <P>For Ireland, the major concerns in this agenda relate to certain aspects of the proposals for cohesion, economic and monetary union, social policy, common foreign and security policy and other questions which I will touch on.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with these <Col N="1291" /> issues, I should like to emphasise again the commitment of the Government to the concept of European Union, both in its economic and monetary aspects and in its political purpose.  In pressing to have our concerns accommodated, we underlined our fundamental adherence to the concept and principle of European Union, which we fully support.</P>
    <P>Cohesion was an important priority for us in the negotiations in both Inter-governmental Conferences.  An economic and monetary union which did not have firm provisions for sharing the benefits of the union with the less well-off regions would not be a union worthy of the name.  In fact, without such firm provisions, an economic and monetary union would have the effect of concentrating the benefits of the union on the already well-endowed central areas of the union.  This would be gravely damaging to the economic and social wellbeing of the less well-off regions particularly those, like Ireland, which are peripheral to and distant from the main economic centres of Europe.</P>
    <P>We had a clear negotiating strategy, therefore, from the outset to ensure that the Treaty contained the fullest possible recognition of cohesion as a basic objective of the Treaty and that this recognition was accompanied by firm commitments to the measures, including financial measures, to achieve cohesion.</P>
    <P>We took the lead, therefore, in tabling amendments to the Single European Act to ensure full recognition of cohesion as a basic objective of the union.  We were extremely successful in our negotiations and, as a result, the new Treaty contains provisions which are highly satisfactory and a substantial advance on the provisions of the Single European Act. These provisions comprise: the inclusion of cohesion and solidarity between member states among the basic objectives of the Community; the addition of rural development among the basic cohesion objectives contained in the Rome Treaty; the requirement that the formulation and implementation of all <Col N="1292" /> other Community policies, such as agriculture and trade policies, policy on R &amp; D and State aids, and the implementation of the Single Market, must take account of cohesion and must contribute to its achievement; the requirement that the Commission report every three years on the progress towards cohesion and on how the various Community policies and funds and national policies have contributed to it.  These reports are to be accompanied, if necessary, by appropriate remedial proposals.</P>
    <P>We were not satisfied with that, however.  We made clear in our conference negotiations and in all bilateral discussions that, unless the Treaty were accompanied by firm commitments on practical measures to bring about cohesion, we would find it impossible to accept the Treaty, and we could not recommend it to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>We decided that the firm practical commitments we sought should be contained in a protocol to the Treaty so that it had the highest legal status short of being in the Treaty itself, which would not be appropriate for details of practical programme commitments.  It was for us a major success that a protocol on cohesion was adopted reflecting the concerns and commitments we wished to see reflected in such a protocol.</P>
    <P>The Cohesion Protocol has clear new commitments which the union must now honour to assist the faster economic and social cohesion of the less well-off regions with the more prosperous regions.  These commitments include two we were particularly concerned to obtain.  The first is that the rates of Community intervention under structural funding can be modulated to avoid excessive increases in budgetary expenditures in the less prosperous member states.  It will be evident to everyone in the House that that is a most valuable concession to have won as structural funding is not beneficial if the burden of the national matching contribution is excessive.</P>
    <P>The second new valuable commitment is that the scope of the Structural Funds will now be extended beyond the traditional areas of funding in order to cover <Col N="1293" /> the specific needs of individual less prosperous member states.  Again, it will be evident to all in this House that a widened scope for structural funding is a particular advantage and need for us.</P>
    <P>These two new commitments will have profound significance in easing our budgetary difficulties in matching increased structural funding.</P>
    <P>The protocol reaffirms the continued roles of the Structural Funds and provides that their appropriate size from 1993 onwards will be decided in 1992. This is also a firm commitment which can only be interpreted as presaging a further increase in the funds in view of its linkage to the task of the Community in the area of economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>The biggest success we had, however, in the area of cohesion was the provision in the Treaty and the protocol that a Cohesion Fund will be established before the end of 1993 to make a financial contribution to action designed to promote cohesion in the fields of the environment and the trans-European networks.  Our special need in relation to this new fund is acknowledged in the fact that it is provided that in the transport networks special attention will be given to island and peripheral regions.  This new fund is confined to member states whose GNP per capita is below 90 per cent of the Community average and who fulfil the conditions of economic convergence under European Monetary Union or have programmes under way to do so. Ireland fully meets these criteria.</P>
    <P>The fund will have special significance and application in Ireland.  We suffer more than most countries economically from our peripheral location distant from our markets because we export equivalent of two thirds of our output.  The deficiencies and inefficiencies in our transport communications with our markets impose a heavy economic cost which reduces significantly our competitiveness. This new fund designed for island, land-locked and peripheral regions will enable us to make dramatic improvements in our transport communications by improvements in national roads, harbours, airports, ferries, and <Col N="1294" /> transport facilities generally to increase transport speed and reduce transport costs.</P>
    <P>As regards the environment, we have a huge environmental programme to finance in this decade in reducing water and air pollution and developing our water supplies and water purification systems.  We know from our discussions with the Commission that our peripheral and environmental needs were specially intended when the fund was proposed.</P>
    <P>It is notable that for the first time we have a significant fund that is specifically earmarked for the environment as one of its key objectives, as every one is agreed that environmental protection is an essential but costly task with important trans-frontier implications.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand that this new fund will be additional to the Structural Funds so that one of our major concerns that there should be an increased flow of funds to assure and accelerate cohesion has been met.</P>
    <P>Ideally, we would, of course, like to move towards more automatic transfer mechanisms.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we set this out as a longer term objective of our EC policy and we shall continue to work towards it.  However, we recognise from the early stages of these negotiations that the degree of integration likely to emerge from the IGCs would fall well short of the degree of political homogeneity that provides the framework for such mechanisms in existing federations.  There never was any prospect of getting agreement at this stage on initiating now such mechanisms, and suggestions that we should actively seek them were completely unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The outcome of Maastricht, therefore, in regard to cohesion has been an outstanding achievement.  We have secured a whole range of binding legal provisions in the Treaty and, in addition, have secured firm commitments in a legal protocol which far exceeds in status and certainty the Declaration on the Structural Funds adopted on the occasion of the Single European Act.  Between the <Col N="1295" /> Treaty provisions and the protocol provisions we can expcect substantial increases under more flexible conditions than ever in the transfers of resources to aid our cohesion which was our fundamental negotiating position in agreeing to economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Ministers for Finance attended the Council for the discussion of this time which was central to our consideration of the move towards European Union. Fortunately, the bulk of the Economic and Monetary Union Treaty provisions had been agreed before the European Council meeting, so this area did not take up much time at the Council, though Finance Ministers meeting concurrently in the same building as Heads of Government in Maastricht did have a busy time there.</P>
    <P>The main item which had to be considered was the decision-making arrangements for the transition to Stage III of European Monetary Union, leading to a single currency for the Community. There was a great desire on the part of most countries, including Ireland, to ensure that the process being set in train would be irreversible and would lead within a reasonably short and certain period to the establishment of full European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>The agreement which was reached provides for two possible procedures.  The first, which will apply at end of 1996, provides for a decision by qualified majority at that time to set a date for Stage III, if a majority of the member states fulfils the necessary convergence conditions for the adoption of a single currency and it is considered appropriate for the Community to enter Stage III.</P>
    <P>If by the end of 1997 the date for the beginning of Stage III has not been set under this procedure, then the date of 1 January, 1999 will be set.  This date will apply automatically, without the need for a further decision.  However, a decision will be needed, by qualified majority, on which member states fulfil the necessary convergence conditions.  Only those countries will move ahead to full European Monetary Union at that time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> The UK and Denmark sought and obtained special protocols which allow them to take a further decision on their participation in Stage III, at the time that the date for transition is being decided. This arose because of special circumstances in those countries.  All the other member states, with the exception of the United Kingdom, are firmly committed to moving to Stage III.  The United Kingdom at this point are not committed to such a move: neither are they committed against it.  They say that the decision to go ahead or not to will be taken at the time.</P>
    <P>I am fully confident that Ireland will be in a position to move to Stage III of European Monetary Union with the first group of countries.  The convergence conditions which must be met are set out in the draft Treaty documents.  They relate to price stability, a sound budgetary position, convergence of interest rates and a stable currency in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS.  We are already in a better position than many member states to meet these conditions and intend to continue with the necessary policies to sustain and indeed improve this position over the coming years.  I need hardly, of course, point out in this House that one of the reference values to be taken into account in assessing a country's ability to move to Stage III is a ratio of Government debt to GDP of not greater than 60 per cent &mdash; and this is very important &mdash; or evidence that the country's ratio is moving consistently downwards to that figure.</P>
    <P>Overall, the European Monetary Union decisions now envisage that Stage II start on 1 January 1994, with the establishment of the European Monetary Institute.</P>
    <P>Stage III will start anytime from 1997 onwards and at least on 1 January 1999. The European Central Bank will be set up just before the start of Stage III, and the single currency and single monetary policy will apply from the start of Stage III.  The economic side of European Monetary Union will be characterised by close co-ordination of monetary policies <Col N="1297" /> and by provisions to avoid excessive budget deficits.</P>
    <P>On social policy an important concern of the Community is to ensure that the union does not become simply an area or organisation concerned solely with the creation of wealth.  It must be our concern also that the citizens of the Union, through its organisation and operations, benefit also from its progress.  In this context, we stressed the overwhelming importance which we in Ireland attach to employment.  Our proposal that the promotion of employment should be among the first objectives of social policy was accepted during the preparatory work for Maastricht.</P>
    <P>The discussion in Maastricht on social policy was certainly the most protracted and possibly most difficult of all our work there.  I do not intend to detain the House with details.</P>
    <P>From the outset of the negotiations on social policy in the Intergovernmental Conference, Ireland negotiated constructively to achieve a sound basis for agreement.  I approached the negotiations in Maastricht in this spirit and found the Dutch Presidency and partners willing to go as far as possible to find a compromise acceptable to all.  Unfortunately, it did not prove possible to accommodate the very special concerns of the United Kingdom.  In the circumstances, the other eleven decided to move ahead on the following basis.</P>
    <P>First, the present Treaty text, beyond which the United Kingdom was not willing to proceed, remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>Second, the other eleven member states have concluded an agreement strengthening the Community's capacity to act on social policy.  This agreement is essentially the same as that contained in the Presidency's draft Treaty.  This approach sets a series of objectives for the Community and its member states, including, as the first objective, as we had argued in the negotiations, the promotion of employment.  It also modifies the decision-making arrangements which will apply to decisions in the social policy area.  In particular, the areas covered by qualified majority voting are significantly <Col N="1298" /> extended.  Certain sensitive areas are reserved for unanimity or are excluded from Community competence.  The agreement also enables the social partners to play an important role in social policy formulation.</P>
    <P>The text agreed by the eleven contains a definition of working conditions in the list of issues for qualified majority voting which is not as clear as we would have wished.  Deputies will be aware of our concerns on this point which I expressed to the House on 28 November.  However, as Ireland has always been committed to progress by the Community I did not see any scope for seeking, as the UK has been given, what is virtually a permanent derogation from a major common policy. This approach is in line with what we took in the past with the EMS, with the Social Charter when it was agreed in Strasbourg in 1989 and, of course, at Maastricht when we agreed with the overwhelming majority of member states on the irreversibility of the move to full economic and monetary union.  It is, above all, in line with our refusal to accept a two-tier Community.  Having agreed to join in the further progress to be made by the Community in the social area, we will be relying on several important aspects of the new Treaty to ensure that our particular concerns are taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>First, the Community now has, as I have said, a strong and comprehensive definition of subsidiarity.  This principle will have to be taken into account in the formulation of the social legislation in particular.</P>
    <P>Second, there is provision that social policy directives must avoid imposing undue burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises in such a way that might inhibit their creation and development. Given the situation which now exists on social policy, we will be insisting that this requirement is fully and scrupulously observed by the Commission in its proposals.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is a requirement that directives should have regard to the conditions in each of the member states.  The UK, our major trading partner, is not <Col N="1299" /> party to the new social policy, and this could have implications for competition. Again we will expect that this factor will be fully taken into account by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, there is the provision, arising from an agreement between the European Trade Union Confederation and the European employers' body that was taken up by the Intergovernmental Conference, that before submitting social policy proposals, the Commission shall consult management and labour about the possible direction of Community policy and that if the Commission then decides to go ahead with Community action, it will obtain the opinion or recommendations of the two sides of industry on the envisaged proposal.</P>
    <P>On the concerns which I have heard expressed about the effect of social policy on competitiveness, I need hardly point to the facts that some of the countries inside and outside the Community with the highest productivity and the highest standards of living have also the most advanced social legislation; and also to the requirement in the proposed Treaty, as it stands, that the very first sentence of the Social Chapter requires the Community and its member states to have as their objective the promotion of employment.</P>
    <P>I regret that it was not possible for us to move forward as Twelve in this vital area.  I understand the reasons behind the decision of the UK to remain with the existing provisions.  But if we wanted to maintain social progress in the Community yet avoid a damaging breakdown in the Treaty negotiations, we had no choice but to adopt the solution that we did, with an agreement that is not formally part of the Treaty, but which will be implemented for all practical purposes as if it were.  I cannot understand how anyone who claims the interests of workers at heart should advocate forcing a complete breakdown bringing progress on the social charter to a halt throughout the Community.  For the reasons I have mentioned it was unthinkable that Ireland should refuse to join in a major <Col N="1300" /> step forward by the Community in an area to which member states attach a very high priority.  I am sure that on the basis of the provisions which I have outlined our essential concerns in the area of working conditions will be understood by the Commission and by our partners.</P>
    <P>The agreement on a common foreign and security policy is along the lines I described to the House on 28 November. All the main negotiating objectives I set out then have been achieved.</P>
    <P>It was important that the negotiations should succeed on this issue.  Faced with the remarkable changes in Europe and international affairs over the past few years, it is clear that the Community needs new and strengthened mechanisms for dealing with the world: indeed that is a fundamental principle on which the draft Treaty is based.  Moreover, our international partners expect that a Community more united economically and politically will be able to deal with them in a more coherent and co-ordinated manner.  I believe that the provisions agreed on a common foreign and security policy will equip the union to respond effectively to the major challenges ahead through strengthened and expanded co-operation and through joint action.</P>
    <P>The principle issues I want to deal with now concern the provisions on majority voting and the agreement reached on security and defence, which were the major focus of discussion by Heads of State and Government on this chapter.</P>
    <P>In so far as voting is concerned, I have previously outlined to the House our view that an immediate move to majority voting would be inappropriate in an area as sensitive as foreign and security policy. Our preferred solution to this issue &mdash; which was one of the more difficult in this Chapter of the Treaty &mdash; was for a procedure whereby the Council would by unanimity define those matters on which decisions are to be taken by majority. And this was what was agreed.</P>
    <P>This procedure will admit the principle of majority voting in the area of foreign and security policy, allow the practice to be introduced gradually, but will provide the essential safeguard we require.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> In so far as security issues are concerned, the main points of agreement from Ireland's point of view were: first, that the framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence, is a matter for future negotiation in another inter-governmental conference in 1996.  We accepted this in line with our long-standing commitment to partners that we would be prepared to enter into negotiations on a defence arrangement for the Community.  The scope and nature of a common defence policy will be matters for that future negotiation.  And they will have to be agreed by unanimity.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Treaty provides that the policy of the union will not prejudice the specific character of Ireland's security and defence policy.  This is a most important provision.  It enshrines in Treaty language the achievement secured at the second Rome Summit last year which recognised our traditional position.  This was a major objective in the negotiations and I am satisfied that our traditional approach to foreign and security policy is fully protected.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Treaty makes it clear that joint action by the European Union will not extend to defence issues.  All decisions and actions of the Union with defence implications will be matters for the Western European Union.  And any requests made by the European Union to the Western European Union must be agreed by unanimity among the Twelve.</P>
    <P>The nine members of the Western European Union have in a separate declaration set out their views on the future of European defence, including the practical organisational arrangements they intend to make to enable the Western European Union to implement issues referred to it from the European Union. The matters covered by this declaration are essentially for the members of the Western European Union.  From Ireland's point of view what is important are the legal commitments we will enter into through the European Union Treaty itself.  These are the only obligations that we will take on.  And I want to emphasise these will not involve us in a mutual <Col N="1302" /> defence commitment.  They will not oblige us to join an alliance.  And they will not involve us in taking an obligation under the Western European Union Treaty or subscribing to policy platforms adopted by the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The provisions on the common foreign and security policy will enable the Community to play a fuller and more coherent role in international life commensurate with its standing in the world and its responsibilities.  The Treaty sets out the objectives for the union's common foreign and security policy and gives the union the means to achieve them.  This is an important outcome of the Maastricht meeting.  But equally important will be the actual policies that the Twelve will pursue under the new framework. Already the Twelve have a basis for certain policies through European political co-operation.  The Treaty on European Union will enable these to be expanded and strengthened and new policies added by unanimity.  Ireland will play a full and committed part with its partners in developing policies for the European Union based on the values that have traditionally informed our approach to international issues.</P>
    <P>The need to enhance the democratic legitimacy of the union has been a major issue of the negotiations on political union.  While I am firmly of the view that in our country democratic legitimacy is guaranteed by this House and by our local government system, I do recognise the concern that, at the European level, certain deficiencies do exist.  The role of the European Parliament and the powers which it has in the legislative process of the Community have been significantly strengthened as part of the agreements reached in Maastricht.  The Parliament's position in relation to the legislative process has been strengthened, rights of petition and inquiry have been formalised and the appointment of a Community ombudsman has been entrusted to it.</P>
    <P>The most important development, however, is in the area of decision-taking where Parliament will now have a right <Col N="1303" /> to reject the Council's position in a number of important areas of Community policy.  This will allow Parliament to have a greater say and influence on the nature of future Community legislation. The areas which have been selected include education, culture, consumer affairs, research and technology, trans-European networks, environment and the Internal Market.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, Deputies will gather that the discussions at the Maastricht Council were wide ranging, complex and detailed.  The debate was conducted with force but always with a common objective so as to arrive as far as possible at consensus &mdash; for after all what we were discussing was the future for the Community both in its own right and a basis for stability in Europe and the world.  The fact that the Council was conducted amicably despite the many contradictory or opposing views and that it was brought to a successful conclusion is due in large measure to the skilled and determined chairmanship of the Dutch Prime Minister, Mr. Ruud Lubbers &mdash; to whom I would like in this House to convey my appreciation of his work and thanks for his courtesy and hospitality.</P>
    <P>Conclusion of the new Treaty on European Union at Maastricht marks a memorable epoch in the history of our Continent.  The new Union Treaty will have immense consequences for the future development and prosperity of Europe as a whole.  It has become evident over recent years that all European countries now look to the Community as an anchor of political stability and as an economic magnet, and that association with it and eventually in many cases the perspective of eventual membership offer a vital ray of hope, which encourages the recently liberated democracies of Central and Eastern Europe to persevere on what is in the short term the difficult path of creating a stable society based on a market economy.</P>
    <P>The new union will create a higher level of cohesion and solidarity between the different member states.  There is an increased determination to act together <Col N="1304" /> in common.  There is increased acceptance of Community responsibility for the welfare and social rights of all the citizens of Europe, especially in the less developed regions.  The irreversible steps towards economic and monetary union will encourage even before its completion a major effort to achieve both economic convergence and greater cohesion.  Across the Community, we are striving to create a modern, enlightened, progressive society, that is both efficient and humane, prosperous and caring, committed to economic development, yet environmentally sensitive.</P>
    <P>The new union will act together to promote the security, and common interests and ideals of the Community.  It will become an increasing influence in the world.</P>
    <P>In Maastricht, we had from the point of view of the Irish interest successful conclusions on cohesion, economic and monetary union, foreign and security policy, social policy and on the many other important but less fundamental changes proposed in the way in which the Community conducts its affairs.  The conclusions of the Council will be embodied in a formal Treaty which will be drawn up and signed as soon as possible and will form the basis of a referendum here in 1992 after publication of a White Paper. I will, of course, ensure that Deputies and others will have full access to the formal Treaty text as soon as it becomes available here.</P>
    <P>I recommend the conclusions, as they emerged in Maastricht, to this House and to the Irish people.</P>

      <P>No matter what the result, the end of the Maastricht Summit in the early morning of 11 December 1991 was bound to be an historic turning point for Europe.  Maastricht is and was the last chance for the twelve existing members of the Community to decide the powers, financial resources, social mission and democratic character of the European Union that will be enlarged out of all recognition over the next few years.  Over the next ten years the energies of Europe will be entirely devoted <Col N="1305" /> to enlarging the Union agreed at Maastricht to include Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Switzerland, Malta, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and possibly Poland and the three Baltic states.</P>
      <P>The other dominant concern over the next ten years, now that internal business has supposedly been dealt with at Maastricht, will be the relations with the remaining Slav countries to the East and the South, who will not be ready for membership this century.  The entire centre of gravity and centre of intellectual concern in Europe will move to the East after Maastricht.  This process of enlargement and adjustment will be so all-consuming and all-absorbing that little energy will be left to right any internal defects within the Community which may remain as a result of work not completed at Maastricht.  By that criterion Maastricht was in a sense a last chance for this century to settle the Constitution of Europe.  It is by that criterion of the last chance for this century that the Maastricht Summit and its Treaty must be judged.  By that criterion I believe the result is not as good as it could have been for Europe and not as good as it should have been for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is this so?  In part it is so because the Taoiseach did not go to the original Summit in Rome which launched the Maastricht process with any overall Irish vision for or of Europe.  He did not go to Maastricht with any such vision either. In failing to do so, I contend that he put himself at a grave negotiating disadvantage. His oft repeated plea for specific financial commitments for Ireland on grounds of social justice and cohesion was directly negatived by his reluctance to support the Social Charter for many months.  The Taoiseach's lack of conviction, demonstrated here again today, on the need to defend the European Union once it is created, on the idea that there should be clear democratic accountability of the European Union and on the idea that there should be a single unified Treaty with a single unified decision-making process rather than a series of bilateral associations between <Col N="1306" /> states &mdash; the so called three pillars approach rather than the one pillar approach, which is the right one &mdash; in terms of the creation of a genuine federal Europe damaged his case for a truely federal system of redistribution of resources from rich to poor.  The Taoiseach's ambiguities damaged the case he was attempting to make.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was and is an <i>á la carte</i> federalist.  Thus, he lacked conviction in European matters, as in all others.  Thus, in European matters, as perhaps in most others, he is a tactitian, never a strategist. Indeed he never had any strategy so far as these negotiations were concerned other than one of getting as much as possible and giving as little as possible &mdash; the mentality of the huckster.  Europe will never be built on huckstering, bartering or giving as little as possible to get as much as possible.  One must make a convinced investment in the European vision.  Unfortunately, the Fianna Fáil Party have no deep inner conviction about Europe.  They have no deep sense of commitment to the creation of a unified Europe.  They are reluctant members of the Community and their desire is to get as much as possible from the Community and give the Community as little as possible.  That is not the approach which will get the best for Ireland in Europe.  It is a mistaken approach and a mistaken negotiating strategy.  I believe we will, unfortunately, see the negative results of this as time passes.</P>
    <P>I want to use an analogy to describe the negotiating stance of the Government in these and other European matters.  At Maastricht it was decided that Europe would progress forward on a two lane highway.  Ten countries decided to go into the fast lane; another country, Britain, decided it would opt for the slow lane; and the twelfth country, Ireland, could not decide which lane it wanted to be in.  It decided to travel at an uncertain speed with one wheel in the fast lane and the other wheel in the slow lane.  In other words, Ireland, under the present Government, tried to position itself so as to slow down some of the traffic in the fast lane while protesting that it did not <Col N="1307" /> want to move over to the slow lane.  This, as any motorist will tell you, is a dangerous way to travel and is liable to try the patience of other drivers.  Indeed, occasionally one is liable to be run down. That is essentially the approach of the Government so far as negotiation in Europe is concerned.</P>
    <P>There are some in this House &mdash; I do not know how many yet &mdash; who would prefer if we pulled over on to the hard shoulder altogether and let the traffic continue.  That seems to be the position of perhaps one of two of the bureaucratic Leftist parties in the House, but I do not know.  It is at least an honourable, if misguided, position.  I simply cannot understand the position of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; the parties who want to travel the European highway with the wheel in both lanes.  These two parties, true perhaps to their common roots, want to substitute &mdash; we saw this very clearly from the Taoiseach's utterances on defence here today &mdash; sophistry for moral courage and try at the same time to get the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>Let me substantiate this analogy.  The two Government parties argue that Ireland is politically entitled to a large financial commitment from other countries' taxpayers because we have agreed to become part of a close political and economic union.  Yet at the same time as they are asking for this money they say they are unwilling to give a clear unambiguous commitment ever to take part in the defence of the European economic and political union from which they want the money.  They believe that issue should be postponed or fudged.  At the very same time as they are looking for this extra money they baulk at extra powers for the democratically elected Parliament of the proposed union.  Such powers as were granted were granted reluctantly by Ireland, and it was only in the last few weeks that the Taoiseach indicated any favour at all because it was then inevitable that others were going to give those powers to the Parliament.  He made that concession when he addressed <Col N="1308" /> the Intergovernmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union recently. Yet it is that very Parliament whose democratic mandate is required to raise the money we are asking others to spend in this country.</P>
    <P>If we are not prepared to give the Parliament this democratic mandate, how can we ask it for the money?  However, that is what we are doing.  We are defeating ourselves.  At the same time as we are looking for more money the Government insist that the tax policies necessary to raise the extra money in Europe should remain a matter of unanimous decision with the Council of Ministers.  We are afraid they might ask us to reduce some of the taxes going into the Department of Finance.  If we insist that tax matters remain unanimous in the Council of Ministers, that means the big, rich countries will be able to veto extra tax resources for Europe and thereby ensure we never get the money we are looking for.  Our policy on that issue is self-defeating.</P>
    <P>Unless we get rid of unanimous decision in tax matters in the European Council of Ministers the new European Union we are creating will never have enough money to live up to its commitments in this Treaty or any other Treaty.  It is very regrettable that tax resources as distinct from commitments, legal and otherwise, were not a key part of the Maastricht Treaty, because without the tax to pay for them the commitments will be just words on paper. This is the sort of anomalous position in which drivers trying to drive in two lanes at the same time tend to find themselves.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear the position of the Fine Gael Party &mdash; one of the Christian Democratic parties which perhaps are the major political force in ten of the 12 countries which met at Maastricht &mdash; on the issue of a two speed Europe.  The Fine Gael Party believe &mdash; without hesitation &mdash; about tax policy, about the social charter, about defence, about security, about foreign policy, about <Col N="1309" /> giving extra powers to the European Parliament, that Ireland should join unambiguously the other parties in Europe's fast lane and make the number of countries travelling in the fast lane 11, not ten. Let us make up our minds here in this House and get on with it.  We cannot continue in this process of ambiguity as far as a two speed Europe is concerned.</P>
    <P>Against that political background, let me now assess the outcome of Maastricht. The agreement to set up a single European currency is a huge step forward. If that was the only provision in the Treaty it would make it worthwhile and worth endorsing.  It will save large costs for businesses throughout Europe. It will help exporting countries like Ireland.  It will help tourism within Europe, and we are a country that hopes to benefit from tourism.  It will promote efficiency.  People will know the value of products no matter in what part of Europe they are buying them and they will be able to compare prices easily.  It will promote competition, it will make Europe efficient and it will create a true sense of our being citizens of one great European country.  If they were the only provisions in this Treaty of Maastricht, the economic and monetary provisions would make it worth endorsement by the Irish people, and that I heartily welcome. I commend the Taoiseach and others for whatever part they had &mdash; and I am sure it was a considerable part &mdash; in that achievement.  So also do I welcome the extension of the powers of the Community into new areas such as the environment and consumer policy.  The European Commission will have considerably enhanced powers in those areas and will be able to ensure that the market is fair as well as free.  That, too, is welcome.</P>
    <P>However, the much-heralded protocol on economic and social cohesion, to which the Taoiseach referred in his speech, will only work if the wording of the protocol is sufficiently precise to enable it to be enforced in a court of law. Without the commitment of financial resources we may well have to have recourse to law to make that protocol <Col N="1310" /> work.  Having read the protocol fairly carefully I conclude &mdash; I hope I am wrong &mdash; that Irish lawyers, on behalf of the Irish Government, would have extreme difficulty in court forcing the European Commission or the European institutions to do anything very specific on foot of the wording of that protocol.  However, I hope I will be proven wrong on that point.  I am sure the Taoiseach will be able to get legal advice on that matter.</P>
    <P>The proposal to set up a new special cohesion fund, in addition to the existing Structural Funds, will only be of help to Ireland if it does not diminish the money available through the Structural Funds already.  Ireland already does disproportionately well from the existing funds.  The crucial difficulty is that the Treaty of Maastricht has made no commitment at all to creating extra money and an extra tax base for Europe.  Without an enlarged tax base the danger is that the setting up of this new cohesion fund could actually reduce the amount of money available to Ireland by diverting money from funds from which we get a disproportionately large share perhaps to a cohesion fund from which we might get only a proportionate share.  If the total amount of money is the same we could actually lose as a result of the establishment of the cohesion fund, even though we would be benefiting from it, because the net amount of money would not be changed.  That needs to be clarified as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The total exemption of Britain from the Social Charter will, I fear, give bodies like the Scottish Development Board, the Welsh Development Board and, indeed, the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board a big marketing advantage in competition with the IDA in North America and Japan.  I have met the Keidanren in Japan in the past and I know they are foolishly obsessed with paper provisions in regard to employees' rights, shareholdings, information and so forth.  They are very excited about that. In fact, the provisions in the Social Charter may not mean a great deal in terms of the efficient running of any business and many of them may be conducive <Col N="1311" /> to more efficient running of business by better exchange of information; but that is not how it is seen in Japan and in the boardrooms of North America.  We are now going to have a situation where British development agencies will be able to go to Japan and North America and say: &ldquo;look, we can give you cut price access, if you locate in Britain, to all of the single European Market but you will not have to pay the social price; whereas if you go to Dublin, Castleblayney, Clones or anywhere in the Republic or any place else in the rest of Europe you will have to pay the full social price as well as getting access.  Given that you do not have much time to go into the law and study the protocols in detail would it not be cheaper and easier to send your project tour to Britain first and if you get an adequate location there, do not bother about the other countries.&rdquo;  I believe we have handed Britain a major negotiating advantage in terms of industrial development and overseas investment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Likewise, I believe that Britain's ability, acknowledged in this Treaty, to opt out of the single currency may well mean that the Irish Border at the end of this century will be the only land frontier in Europe where travellers will have to change their money.  For a party that have prided themselves in their twin national objectives, one of which was to re-unify this country, to put their name to a Treaty the result of which may well be that the border at Aughnacloy or Newry will be the only border in Europe where people have to change their money is surely a ludicrous and unfortunate situation.  I saw no evidence in the Taoiseach's meeting with Prime Minister Major to suggest he made any progress in pursuading Prime Minister Major, who apparently is a reasonable man, of the totally unreasonable character of the proposed opt-out as far as North-South relations in Ireland are concerned.  There were many words about bilateral meetings and so on. The Taoiseach could be meeting Prime Minister Major once a week for the next six years and he will not undo what may well be the result of that being the only <Col N="1312" /> border in Europe where people have to change their money at the end of this century.</P>
    <P>I should say, Sir, that the precedent of national opt-outs which the British won in this Treaty is a very bad one and will create immense problems in the negotiation of enlargement to include other countries.  I can see the Czechs, the Slovaks, the Austrians, the Swiss looking for opt-outs <i>á la Grande Bretagne,</i> opt-outs <i>a la</i> Major.  If Major is entitled to an opt-out, why not the Swedes?  Everybody will want an opt-out now once Maastricht agreed to the principle.  I think it will make negotiation very difficult.</P>
    <P>My other concern is that the Treaty does not contain sufficient provisions to stamp out the unfair financial help that rich countries can give to their businesses and farmers in competition with businesses and farmers operating in smaller and poorer countries like Ireland.  The MacSharry reform plan for the Common Agricultural Policy may well lead to the re-nationalisation of agricultural policies. This will not be done overtly but through concealed schemes like extra local social security concessions and entitlements, extra income tax breaks &mdash; which only apply in national law &mdash; and extra concessions of one kind or another, perhaps on local taxation.  Already we have a situation where a very wealthy country like the Netherlands have detailed local complicated tax breaks, which are virtually impossible for any non-Dutch speaker to understand, designed to attract mobile industrial investment to the very centre of the Community and the Netherlands on better financial terms than we are giving here on the periphery. There is no sufficient control in the European Community Treaties to stamp out these special sweetheart deals which big countries will be able to give their farmers to avoid the effect of the Common Agricultural Policy changes and to their industrialists to avoid the effects of the open market.  Unless there is control on aid of that kind we will not achieve cohesion and there is nothing in the Maastricht Treaty that is significant in terms of solving that problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> I believe &mdash; and I have said this before in this House &mdash; that our case for extra resources in Ireland does not depend on the begging bowl &mdash; we are not looking for charity, we are entitled to extra help on very clear grounds.  I will mention four: first, the Economic and Monetary Union &mdash; the single currency &mdash; agreed at Maastricht will deprive us of the right to use the exchange rate to protect our export industries.  We will never be able to do that again.  If cohesion is to be achieved we will need extra resources to compensate for the losses.</P>
    <P>The proposed reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy threaten a huge and disproportionate loss for Ireland, a loss that will not be suffered in the same proportion by any other EC country.  We need help with that.</P>
    <P>The opening up to Eastern Europe, with the problems there, will create disproportionate problems for Ireland. Eastern Europe is heading into an economic depression similar to that suffered by the West in the early thirties.  The EC have no choice but to help out and there are three ways in which we can help.  We can give aid or allow Eastern Europeans to immigrate to Western Europe or we can open up EC markets to Eastern European products.  Wealthy EC taxpayers will have a natural tendency not to want to give too much aid and they will not be keen on immigration either, because huge numbers of dispossessed East German citizens arriving at the railway stations of Berlin and Brussels will add further to the racial tensions which exist on the Continent.</P>
    <P>Those two options will not solve the problems of depression in Eastern Europe so the third option of opening up the markets will be taken.  Will that affect sophisticated machine tooled industries in Western Europe?  It will not, because there is nothing in Eastern Europe to compete with that.  However, Eastern Europe can produce cheap, unsophisticated food products such as beef and butter, the sort of thing we have trained our industry to produce for EC intervention over the last 15 years.  The opening up of trade with Eastern Europe <Col N="1314" /> which may be inevitable will destroy whatever support for agricultural incomes is left after the MacSharry plan has been put through.  That is another reason why we needed special help at Maastricht, and why the Taoiseach's protocol must be examined with some care.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that, with the exception of Britain, the declared aim of all the states who gathered at Maastricht was to build a genuine Federation &mdash; to build a United States of Europe.  Federations, like the USA, operate on the basis of automatic transfers from rich to poor.  Europe cannot claim to be a genuine federation if transfers from rich to poor depend on good contacts and special pleading.  To a great extent that is what it will depend on after Maastricht.  I hope I am wrong.  Those are the reasons why we needed a very strong commitment on transfers of finance.</P>
    <P>However, money alone is not enough. We must put the money to good use. Pouring European money into badly planned roads, which in some cases add to travelling time, will simply waste European money as well as our own.  Pouring money into training by a training monopoly called FáS is also a waste of European money, because we have not reorganised training so that we can benefit more creatively from EC money.  The EC money might be better used to reduce the obstacles to work in the tax system, to improve basic education, or even to pay off some of our national debt.</P>
    <P>The institutional structure of the Maastricht Treaty is tilted in favour of larger states.  There is no commitment to even consider an elected European Senate as part of the European Parliament, in which small states would have representation equal to that of large states. That is the system that exists in the US. Also, the tax and revenue provisions underpinning the treaty are so weak that the European institutions will probably be unable to fulfil their obligations.  That will leave a vacuum which will be filled, as it was filled in the past by big states using money and power to rig the rules <Col N="1315" /> to their own advantage.  The legal structure of the Treaty is also weak.  The Commission, the traditional guarantor of small states is effectively excluded from taking the initiative in large areas of new work.  It is excluded from justice policy, from taking the initiative in foreign policy and from taking the initiative in defence. The Commission has always been the guarantor of small states.  This Treaty represents a shift towards an inter-governmental model where bigger states will have more influence, and away from the traditional Treaty of Rome model where the Commission had the only power of initiative, where small states were protected.</P>
    <P>The new principle of subsidiarity about which the Taoiseach spoke so glowingly could prove to be a major Trojan horse in this Treaty.  As set out in draft Article 3 (b), this principle may work to the detriment of smaller states.  This Article limits the community to acting only where an objective to be fulfilled cannot be sufficiently achieved by member states acting alone.  In other words, the new legal presumption arising from that Article is against Community action in a particular area.  It is very dangerous.  I can see that clause being used in the European court, by Britain for example, to block Community actions that might otherwise have helped member states. That is certainly not subsidiarity as I envisage it.  It is a form of subsidiarity that is insidious and may well do damge.</P>
    <P>For all its defects this Treaty represents a significant step forward.  It does not go far enough or fast enough towards creating a genuine federal Europe.  I support the Treaty as a step in the right direction, however hesitant and qualified. I will recommend that my party endorse this Treaty and I will advise the Irish people to do likewise in the referendum.</P>
    <P>With regard to defence, the Taoiseach states:</P>
    <P>... the Treaty makes it clear that joint action by the European Union will not extend to defence issues.  All <Col N="1316" /> decisions and actions of the Union with defence implications will be matters for the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>That is a grave mistake.  We are not members of the Western European Union, yet we have agreed in the Treaty that the Western European Union should elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the union which have defence implications.  In that, we have essentially agreed to hand over to the Western European Union responsibility for defence. We have not said that the European Union will have direct responsibility for defence as we should have insisted.  We should have insisted on being part of it, on being there when decisions are being taken, on being able to vote on any decisions being taken.</P>
    <P>If we delegate to a body of which we are not a member, responsibility for European defence, we are putting ourselves in a position where others will do things in our name and we will not have any direct control over them.  That is very foolish and it has resulted directly from the fundamental ambiguity in the Fianna Fáil attitude to Europe.  It goes to the very heart of their hesitancy in deciding on which lane they want to travel.  They say they are in the slow lane while allowing others to drag us along in the fast lane.  We are not driving the car.  We are quite literally a back seat driver with the shutter closed over so that the front seat driver cannot even hear what we are saying about where we are going.</P>
    <P>The declaration by the member states of the European Union appears, in its present form, to preclude the European Union of which we are a member, from becoming directly involved in defence.  It states that the Western European Union is the defence component of European union and the means to strengthen the European pillar of the Atlantic Alliance. We have handed responsibility for our defence to that body.  That is not wise. Before the Western European Union expires in 1998 we should insist that next week we want another inter-governmental conference to draw up a defence policy for Europe which will be <Col N="1317" /> within the Treaty of Rome and whereby we will have proper control and be full partners.  The Irish people do not want their defence to be the responsibility of a body of which they are not a member. We are proud to be Irish in Europe; we are proud to create this European union; we are proud of its social dimension; we are proud of its democratic dimension and we are not afraid to defend it.  We want an intergovernmental conference to actualise that commitment on our part.</P>
    <P>That is what the Taoiseach should have gone to Maastricht to say, should have gone to Rome to say, and that is what I believe this House should, when it gets an opportunity to debate this matter, say to the European people.  We want a new European treaty, not the Western European Union but a new European treaty to defend this union we are creating and we want to share the burdens and the responsibility of that.  We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where others are taking decisions which we will have to take the consequences of without having and effective say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to place some preliminary remarks on the record in relation to the issues involved. I intend to elaborate on each of them in turn.</P>
      <P>In general I would say that Europe must not be allowed to develop merely as a free trade, free market, free for all. Not nearly enough work has been done in Maastricht to remove the fear that this is the direction in which Europe is heading.  On that score alone Maastricht will be seen as a disappointment, and those who want to see a Europe capable of accommodating all its citizens in prosperity and growth will have to redouble their efforts in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to cohesion, it is clear from the reading of the proceedings of the last number of days that we have the Spanish to thank for acceptance of the principle that special funding is necessary to ensure cohesion between the richer and poorer states of the Community.  But the agreement so far reached will need to be fleshed out in considerable detail before its <Col N="1318" /> true meaning can be assessed.  The size of the community's budget and new distribution mechanisms will be key issues, and they have yet to be addressed.  There is now an obligation on the Government to ally themselves overtly with Spain, Portugal and other peripheral countries in the run-up to the next Summit if enough flesh is to be put on the bones adopted in Maastricht to make the commitment meaningful.</P>
    <P>The breakdown of the Summit over social policy and its replacement by a non-binding agreement on the Social Charter &mdash; especially an agreement which at first glance appears to rely heavily on unanimous agreement &mdash; is little short of disgraceful.  It is also inexplicable, and many will feel that it must now be in the interest of working people, and children and the elderly, throughout Europe that Mr. Major is replaced by Mr. Kinnock as soon as possible.  For our own part, Ireland has been too slow to put herself in the forefront of the battle or the Social Charter and that attitude will have to change.</P>
    <P>In relation to security and defence policy, turning the Western European Union into &ldquo;Europe's military wing&rdquo;, as one of the participants apparently described it, is not an expression of common policy in the security and defence areas; it is simply a poor and unacceptable substitute for a coherent policy based on peace and principles of international solidarity and justice.</P>
    <P>While the way towards monetary union seems reasonably clear, the development of a common economic approach leaves many unresolved questions.  The issue of Ireland's competitiveness is a major unresolved question, and the absence of any mention of European industrial policy, any priority for employment, seriously weakens the value of the whole concept of union.  The outcome of the Maastricht Summit will need careful and detailed analysis before the final judgment can be made.  I want to make the position of the Labour Party clear on these issues.  The developments of the last number of days will lead inevitably to a referendum in Ireland.  The Labour <Col N="1319" /> Party will take a clear and unequivocal position on that referendum, but we do not intend to adopt that position until we have considered and debated it fully and openly within the party.  We will not reach a final view until we have seen the White Paper promised by the Government and the legislation intended to give effect to the referendum.</P>
    <P>Many views will be expressed on both sides as this long awaited debate gets under way.  I do not propose to prejudge that debate, but I do intend to place my views firmly on the record.  What has been achieved so far is not enough in some respects and is unacceptable in others.  My principle concerns are these.</P>
    <P>The principles of cohesion outlined in the draft Treaty may represent an advance on the present position, but only in principle.  The next Summit in Portugal will be vital to ensuring that the principle now established is capable of having meaning in actuality and in practice. Above all else, cohesion has to ultimately include some concern for job creation on a European-wide basis.  Without such a concern and concrete policy steps to accompany it, the catching up implicit in the whole principle of cohesion simply will not happen.</P>
    <P>The absence of a social chapter in the Treaty will be immensely damaging.  The signs are that what has replaced it &mdash; the 11-member agreement &mdash; will be completely unworkable.  There is a great deal of work to be done yet on foreign and security policy.  I recognise that this is not an issue which will predominate in the context of what lies immediately ahead, but as yet, there is no underlying set of principles to inform any foreign policy.  I want ultimately to see a commitment to peace, to disarmament, to the principle of international support and solidarity and to justice before I consider that Europe has a foreign policy worth defending.  I have to say, listening to the Taoiseach's contribution this morning that more matters have been left unsaid and unresolved in relation to the foreign and security policy than have been <Col N="1320" /> cleared up by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach has not, in my estimation, established clearly what role the Western European Union is being allowed and what exactly our relationship to it will be.  For example, what is the function of the CSCE?  Likewise, when the Taoiseach talks about our traditional policy in these matters I would say to him that the opportunity in the White Paper to expand and to clarify exactly the traditional aspect of Irish policy would be very desirable rather than leaving it yearly that we will endorse and protect our traditional policy in this area.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is important that we see how the European Parliament reacts to the Treaty, and that we allow ourselves to be influenced by the views expressed in the Parliament.  The developing Europe must be democratic, it must be representative, and it must be accountable.  That is not a lot to ask, but again, one has to ask why there has been so much reluctance to go down that road.</P>
    <P>When all is said and done, however, the central question for us will remain the degree to which we here in Ireland are ready for the challenges that economic union will bring.  Since the start of this year I have been calling for a public debate on this issue.  The absence of such a debate has been one of the most worrying features of our preparation for the consequences of European Monetary Union.  Debate and understanding of the issues involved is absolutely essential, because without adequate preparation we will fail to achieve the benefits of the European Monetary Union, and we could well suffer most of the penalties. In a major sense, the extent to which we will benefit is up to each one of us.  It is up to policymakers, businessmen, workers and citizens generally.  If the Government have failed, as I strongly believe they have already failed, it is because they have done little or nothing to alert and prepare the public for what is now just around the corner.</P>
    <P>In relation to monetary union, it is intended to make economic union work better.  By removing currency risk and the costs of currency conversion it should <Col N="1321" /> encourage cross-Border trade; and by lowering inflation in the community it should lower interest rates.  Although the cost of changing currencies is the most obvious saving arising from European Monetary Union to the person in the street, the other benefits &mdash; if they are achieved &mdash; would be far larger.  By the same token, a failure to achieve those aims would be very costly for our economy.</P>
    <P>It is not yet clear that European Monetary Union will achieve its objectives. In the European monetary system as it is presently structured, the German Bundesbank effectively acts in practice as the Community central bank.  The Bundesbank's record in the control of inflation has been excellent, certainly until the time of German unification.  On the other hand the record of, for example, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain is a lot poorer.  There will be some who will argue that putting the governors of these countries' central banks on the Council of the European Central Bank will not necessarily improve the Community's inflation performance. An improved inflation record is the foundation stone of monetary union.  If it is not achieved, the other benefits are jeopardised, especially lower interest rates; and even fixed exchange rates would be in doubt.</P>
    <P>Low inflation is undoubtedly in the interests of every Irish citizen and it is the primary <i>rationale</i> for monetary union.  In a monetary union, countries forego the right to adjust the exchange rate between their currency and other currencies.  This is a mixed blessing.  In so far as there are good reasons to devalue or re-value it is a loss.  In so far as there are temptations to do so for bad reasons, it may be no harm no longer to have this kind of instrument of economic policy available. Examples of each kind of behaviour are not hard to find.</P>
    <P>In the second half of the seventies and the early eighties, Ireland was on a borrowing spree which boomed domestic demand beyond the capacity of domestic suppliers to meet it.  This produced upward pressure on Irish prices and a <Col N="1322" /> deficit of imports compared with exports. The loss of competitiveness, which resulted from higher inflation than that of our trading partners, was compensated for by periodic devaluations of the IR£. However, that was treating the symptom &mdash; not the disease.  In that sense, the devaluation options only postponed the time when the real problem &mdash; inflation &mdash; had to be addressed.  Accordingly, it can be argued that easy access to devaluation was not in our interests at the time.</P>
    <P>The discipline imposed by fixed exchange rates is not the only possible cost of European Monetary Union.  Another one is the restriction on fiscal policy imposed in the Draft Treaty.  Specifically, in European Monetary Union, member states must &ldquo;avoid excessive government deficits&rdquo;.  In the case of Ireland, our debt burden is already so heavy that prudence and common sense make it certain that we are not going to take an incautious approach to debt in the future, but if there were room for manoeuvre, there would undoubtedly be an argument that (a) public developmental investment, to accelerate the catching-up of average Irish to average EC incomes, or (b) short term disturbances, could require a budget deficit larger than the 3 per cent which we will now have to aim at, which is in fact a totally arbitrary number without any economic significance.</P>
    <P>By the same token, it must be said that the many and pressing social problems within Ireland require a level of public spending and investment which, in all probability, will be ruled out forever once European Monetary Union becomes a reality, unless we achieve very high rates of economic growth.</P>
    <P>A possible third cost of European Monetary Union is the fact that interest rates will be determined by a European Central Bank and not by national central banks.  In so far as they are set by the Community as a whole, they may not be appropriate for a particular region. However, since this is what the EMS effectively does already, it will not be anything new and cannot therefore be &ldquo;blamed on European Monetary Union&rdquo;.  In any case, the record of <Col N="1323" /> national governments throughout Europe in setting interest rates to facilitate growth without igniting inflation has not been very successful in the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>Let us not get too carried away about the progress made on monetary union in Maastricht.  It is clear benefits will flow from it but the job must surely be to ensure that those benefits flow equally in the direction of Cork as well as Cologne, or working people as well as financiers. That is where economic union and cohesion must come into play.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that the most clear-cut risks of substantial costs from European Monetary Union lie on the side of economic rather than monetary union &mdash; in our economy's capacity to deal with increased competition.  If these costs occur, I already pointed out in the debate prior to the summit that we will have no one to blame but ourselves &mdash; thanks almost entirely to the lack of leadership from our Government.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Government have concentrated almost entirely in their approach to economic union on a &ldquo;subsidy-hunting&rdquo; approach.  We have never heard any salient case from the Government about the size of the EC's overall budget, or about the policy measures that are necessary to ensure cohesion as an integral part of economic union.  Unless we begin to hear that case being made, coherently and strongly, it will be very difficult to persuade the working people of Ireland, the unemployed, pensioners and others, that Europe means anything at all to them.  I would have to say that as things stand at present, the main prospect that economic union holds out is more wealth and more prosperity, but with most of it concentrated in other regions of Europe, not in this country.</P>
    <P>In the debate prior to the Summit, I described our position as &ldquo;hunting for the crumbs and ignoring the cake&rdquo;.  I went on to say that:</P>
    <P>Nobody could describe this as very smart.  The very logic of European <Col N="1324" /> Monetary Union makes subsidy-hunting an inappropriate strategy for the medium term.  After all, when 1992 &mdash; the economic union part of European Monetary Union &mdash; was devised, the whole idea was to increase the degree of competition in European economies. Put very bluntly, this meant leaving companies to fight it out between them, with only the fittest being guaranteed to survive.  A company or a country which regards itself as entirely dependent on subsidies has all the wrong attitudes when it comes to its own survival at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Spain has shown us very clearly how it is necessary to bring single-minded determination to the task of benefiting from economic union.  They have done so in two ways &mdash; first, by the work they have done in equipping the Spanish economy to deal with competition, through modernisation and efficiency which has led to a high growth rate and, second, in their determination not to take no for an answer from the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>In the run up to the next Summit, in Portugal, the details of new cohesion funds and other policy measures will have to be worked out.  The working out of these matters will be absolutely vital if the principle of cohesion is to mean anything in practice.</P>
    <P>I want to argue here that over the next months, our Government must set out to forge a clear and distinct alliance with Spain, Portugal and Greece, to ensure that cohesion is backed up by conscious policy measures.  In the absence of such an alliance we must make it clear that what has been agreed so far simply does not go far enough in satisfying our needs. For example, we will not, and cannot, accept any situation where the new cohesion fund is financed by cut-backs in other essential funds.  What we must be campaigning for is an increase in the overall EC budget, to make additional money available for real and significant transfers.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat here what I said in the earlier debate: the real issues in the nineties for economies like Ireland are <Col N="1325" /> all &ldquo;catching up&rdquo; issues.  We have to aim at closing the income gap between Ireland's and the Community's average income.  That means that cohesion funding must be real, and substantial, but it also means our industry has to be far more competitive, efficient and reliable than it is at present.  We need economies of scale, research and development, a capacity to deliver on time, new products, new processes and new methods of production.  We will never be the biggest in Europe, but there is no reason why we cannot be the best in Europe.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the fiasco surrounding the social policy chapter of the Treaty. The only conclusion I can come to, when I examine the record of the Irish Government in this area, is that the Taoiseach must have heaved a secret sigh of relief when the summit capitulated to British Tory concerns about social policy.</P>
    <P>The chapter on social policy has now been replaced by an agreement.  As I understand it, it is an agreement which requires unanimity among the 11 signatories on all new initiatives dealing with the following areas: social security and social protection of workers; protection of workers where their employment contract is terminated; representation and collective defence of the interests of workers; conditions of employment for third country nationals legally residing in Community territory and financial contributions for promotion of employment and job creation.</P>
    <P>In addition, that agreement leaves up to individual member states activities in the following fields: improvement of the working environment to protect workers' health and safety; working conditions; information and consultation of workers; equality between men and women, and the integration of persons excluded from the labour market.</P>
    <P>By no stretch of the imagination could this be described as a Social Charter.  It can only be described as a mickey mouse commitment to improve the conditions of working people.  The new agreement does not even mention pensioners, for example.  It has no explicit commitment in relation to people with a disability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> In short, the entire Social Charter is now completely up in the air.  Under this agreement we are entirely dependent on the Government, whose approach over the last three years has been almost entirely regressive, for progress in relation to such fundamental issues as equality and the protection of workers' rights.  In that sense, Maastricht can only be described as a step into the past.  A lot of the work done over many years in relation to social progress has been undone at a stroke and, unfortunately and sadly, there has not been so much as a whimper in protest from the Government.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the coming weeks the White Paper, promised by the Government for some time, will be published. It is a matter of regret that it was not published during the past 12 months to allow a constructive debate to take place. Sadly, while people have been bombarded with information on the important issues to be raised at Maastricht during the past ten days prior to that no information was available to those people on the street who were looking for it. Even now, I would say that most people do not understand the technicalities and the detail.</P>
    <P>Will the White Paper, for example, deal with the question of what will happen if Britain changes its mind?  If, in the wake of the general election in the United Kingdom, a new British Government adopt a different position what facility will be used to allow them catch up and sign the new agreement?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we were given no assurances from the Taoiseach this morning in relation to the necessity to have a foreign affairs committee in the House. In the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I say the sooner such a committee are established the better.  If we had a foreign affairs committee the Treaty and the conclusions reached at Maastricht could be analysed and thoroughly debated in detail there and there would be no need to make statements for two hours.  Unfortunately, we are going to lose vital time.  Such a committee could consider this Treaty in detail <Col N="1327" /> during January, with the assistance of experts, given that this is an extremely complex area.</P>
    <P>I again urge the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, if at all possible, to establish a foreign affairs committee before the conclusion of this Dáil session with a brief to look immediately at the conclusions reached at the Maastricht Summit and the contents of the Treaties to ensure that the Members of this House are better informed in relation to the complex issues which, whether we like or agree with them, are going to form the basis of the way in which the country is going to be run during the next 20 to 30 years.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable and a major weakness in terms of the politics of this country that we are not yet in a position to be better informed and to have questions answered in relation to these issues. Obviously, we must wait to see what progress is made in relation to the measures setting up the new cohesion fund.  Perhaps the White Paper will touch on this issue.  I am not sure how conclusive it can be in relation to the cohesion fund, the mechanism whereby it will be established, and its importance in the overall EC budget.  We must wait to see the approach adopted by our Government. I hope in everyone's interest that the Government will take a more progressive attitude, now that the protocol has been established and that we can talk about it. The Government should come before the House at the earliest opportunity and tell us what they intend to do.  Will they form alliances?  For example, will they work with the Spaniards, who led the march in relation to the cohesion funds?  Will they tell us exactly what our people will be voting for?  Many issues have to be teased out and explained to the House and the people.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the vision of Europe has been advanced significantly to a point where every citizen will have an equal right to share in the new growth and wealth.  Sadly, as a result of what happened in Maastricht and particularly what happened in relation to the Social <Col N="1328" /> Chapter, the ideal of a Europe of equal citizenship will have to wait for another day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The value of the Intergovernmental Conference which has just concluded in Maastricht can only be judged on the advances made on issues central to the creation of a democratic Europe seeking social and economic development and whose relations with the rest of the world would be open and non-threatening.  In all such aspects Maastricht has failed.</P>
      <P>The first key issue dealt with in The Workers' Party document towards a democratic Europe, published in November and outlined by Deputy Gilmore and me in this House two weeks ago, was the need for specific guarantees and adequate funding to ensure cohesion in the Community in the short term and that that cohesion would be an integral component of any move towards Economic and Monetary Union.  This has not been achieved and we now face a continuation of the experience of this country as a member state of the Community for the past two decades.  During that time there have been various EC sponsored funded programmes and schemes, all of which were ostensibly geared to bring Ireland closer to parity with the wealthier regions of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy was cited as a vital component in maintaining the development of our agri-industry and providing spin off jobs.  While in recent years total Common Agricultural Policy payments were estimated as being equivalent to £10,000 per farmer, there is no evidence that the Common Agricultural Policy did anything to boost employment in the farming sector or in the processing or marketing of Irish agricultural produce.  It led to costly intervention procedures and added £18 per week to the average family food bill.  It operated at a time when 35 per cent of farmers left the land and there was no visible corresponding increase anywhere else in the agri-business sector.  At the same time we do not have any evidence that food quality improved as a result of Common <Col N="1329" /> Agricultural Policy or that it served to maintain the quality of the environment. Indeed, in so far as the last point is concerned, the Common Agricultural Policy emphasis on intensive production methods probably resulted in environmental deterioration.</P>
    <P>CAP, one of the most cited mechanisms of EC aid to Ireland, can be said to have brought very few long term benefits to Ireland.  More recently, the EC Structural Funds have provided around £600 million a year to Ireland to create the competitive conditions so that our living standards are closer to the EC average. However, there is still rising unemployment and poverty is also rising.  We have in fact twice the EC average of people living in poverty.  Emigration has only been stalled due to the recession in the US and UK and a decrease in demand for Irish labour on the Continent due to factors such as the unification of Germany.</P>
    <P>In short, then, the Community's strategy, as applied, to tackle the problems of Ireland as a peripheral region have been a dismal failure.  What is required is an end to a tinkering around with the issue. A substantial increase in funding, necessary as that is as part of the equation, is not adequate.  But even the money is only a vague promise, with the amount of funding yet to be decided.  What is required, fundamentally, is a reassessment of the manner in which peripheral regions of the Community are assisted by the EC centre.</P>
    <P>The Spanish Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, hit the nail on the head last week when he said that without a specific commitment to cohesion to benefit the people of Spain there would be no new Treaty.  The Taoiseach displayed no such &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; courage.  Instead in his Dáil contribution on Maastricht he merely hoped &ldquo;to get as clear a commitment as possible&rdquo; on the issue of cohesion.  He did not mention figures.  He did not mention new structures, he did not mention new policies. A nod and wink would do him fine. By last weekend he was talking of the need to insert guarantees on cohesion into the Treaty or in an annex to the <Col N="1330" /> Treaty.  But he was essentially talking like a man with a plane ticket in one hand and a begging bowl in the other.  There was little likelihood that such utterings on the eve of the Summit would have the effect of concentrating the minds of the other European heads of government.</P>
    <P>It is little wonder then that there is so little to show at the end of Maastricht. One of the Irish Government's few specific requests, the doubling of Structural Funds, has not been met.  Why did we not insist in having that written into the Treaty?</P>
    <P>If the wealthier member states are serious about cohesion, then they would surely have accepted the need for adequate financial provisions to bring this about.  As it is, I understand that there is concern at the European Commission at the manner in which Ireland has used Structural Funding to date; this may impede attempts to get an increase in future.  I am certainly aware that many regional and community groups in Ireland are extremely concerned at the shabby manner in which their proposals have been treated in the Structural Fund allocations.</P>
    <P>It would appear the Government here would like to treat the regional funds as a kind of super lottery.  There is no commitment to ensure that regional funds are spent as part of a Common EC industrial policy which would be specifically geared to diverting new economic growth to the regions, be it Ireland, Greece, Portugal or wherever.  Again, not only was this not specifically included in the new Treaty, but the approach to industrial development in peripheral regions was seriously weakened.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach could have insisted, as I suggested, on the use of low interest European Investment Bank loans as an additional funding element where there would be a clear direct benefit to the economy and where public revenue would accrue from the services or industries provided.  This could have been incorporated into any new plan, but the Government have not even bothered to consider such an approach.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that Ireland has <Col N="1331" /> twice the EC average of people living in poverty.  Yet I have scanned the Treaty for any specific reference to how the problems facing the 50 million people who live in poverty in this brave new Community are to be tackled.  Any progress towards economic union or cohesion must as a central element deal with the issues of the EC's &ldquo;Fourth World&rdquo;&mdash; the people who live with unemployment, low pay and deprivation in the midst of one of the most advanced economies in the world today, but it continues to fail in that area also.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the question of the social dimension, an issue which seems to be a particular cause of cold sweats for Irish Government negotiators.  The former Minister for Labour and current Minister for Finance regularly warned of the need to ensure competitiveness and to place job creation ahead of social regulation. Increasing social protection for workers, the argument ran, would almost certainly result in employers being either unable to or refusing to create new jobs. The Irish Government have willingly allowed the British Government to block virtually every move to improve the social dimension of the Community.  As a result Irish workers continue to experience lower levels of entitlements than many of their European counterparts, while throughout the Community the right to information on one's workplace or company is still largely denied.</P>
    <P>What this points to, in fact, is the adoption of a peripheral mentality by the Irish Government in their negotiations on the Treaty.  It is as if they do not believe it is possible for Ireland to attain parity with the developed centre of the EC.  We are still stuck at 67 per cent of the average EC income, virtually the same as when we first joined the Community in 1973. The new Treaty, by failing to specify targets or to provide for improvements tied to progress on Economic and Monetary Union, leaves the achievement of cohesion at the whim of the wealthier member states and subject to continual horse trading, and will fail as a result.</P>
    <P>Many of the specific economic and <Col N="1332" /> monetary implications of this Treaty are as yet unclear.  For instance one of the less publicised decisions at the Summit was the approval of a protocol which will save the European pensions industry billions of pounds which it feared it might have to pay out in backdated equal pension benefits to men and women.  The protocol, part of the political agreement at the Summit, states that companies will not be required to provide equal pension benefits for men and women for any period of service before 17 May 1990.  It has been estimated that in Ireland the benefits for pensioners would have been in the order of £500 million while throughout the Community the benefits would have run to many billions of pounds.  Can the Taoiseach inform us what position he took on this issue?  Was he in favour of the decision or against? Had he any opinion, or did he have anything to say on the matter at all?</P>
    <P>Democracy lost out yet again at Maastricht. The message from the EP President at Mastricht was ignored.  The Taoiseach's preoccupation has been exactly the opposite to achieving democratic legitimacy.  His objective is to retain as much powers as possible for the semi-secret European Council and to prevent the sharing of real powers with the democratically elected European Parliament.  The Taoiseach has cited the fact that we are a small country in a large Community and that Ireland would only have 15 MEPs out of 518 MEPs as reasons for refusing to cede any powers to the EP.</P>
    <P>When one compares the outcome of Maastricht with what was needed, we must question fundamentally the Taoiseach's approach.  Co-decision status with the Council of Minister, which was a minimum demand of the European Parliament has been rejected.  The negative, blocking device, the so-called third reading, for the Parliament in the Maastricht Treaty is likely to be rejected by the Parliament later today as an insult to the people of Europe.  The European Parliament is looking for an interpretations conference comprising the European <Col N="1333" /> Parliament, the Council and the Commission so that before the final legal treaties are signed in February they can have an input into improvements that could be made to them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's stated objections are of course totally spurious.  The Dáil's power to direct or influence Government Ministers when they negotiate in Brussels is nil.  Much of the Dáil's work is now taken up handling enabling legislation which emanates from the Commission or Council.  The overall direction of the Irish economy is now very much controlled by trends in the Community generally. Under European Monetary Union further power is lost over our budgetary strategy.</P>
    <P>What the Taoiseach and the other members of the Council of Ministers are defending is not national democracy or the rights of small nations, but the increasing drift into secretive decision making, the kind of &ldquo;helicopter diplomacy&rdquo; evident when the British Prime Minister arrived here for four hours of talks before the Summit last week.  I have no objection to these types of discussions. They are in fact necessary as a part of the negotiation process.  But from the type of dismissive attitude shown to the Dáil in debate before Maastricht, from the type of insipid and meaningless motion which Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats voted through the Dáil after that debate and from the failure of the Taoiseach to take seriously any of the concerns expressed by the Dáil, it is clear that democratic accountability has to be strengthened at national and local level as well as at European level.</P>
    <P>What we have got from Maastricht is a travesty of the stated aim of a united Europe.  You cannot unite the economies of Europe if on the political side power is ultimately confined to 12 heads of Government meeting twice a year behind closed doors and numerous Ministers meeting in semi-secret.  This will be a recipe for eventual disaster.  Construction of the European Community will not succeed if in the process democracy is the loser.</P>
    <P>Those in Ireland and elsewhere who <Col N="1334" /> want to preserve the old order of the nation state, with all its inadequacies, contradictions and tendencies to national and ethnic hostilities, conflicts and xeno-phobias, will see in this denial of democracy a major opportunity to undermine the entire progress towards political union.</P>
    <P>In Ireland more than most other EC countries we suffer a double denial of democracy.  As I already pointed out, Ireland's fate is already being decided by the Community.  There is no question that we can or should leave the EC.  It would result in economic disaster and cause unpredictable political consequences. What we must fight for are democratic institutions, centred around the European Parliament at European level and the Oireachtas and the regions at home.  Any increase in powers at each level of Government must be accompanied by reform of their operations and their relationships with each other.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have been the only party in Ireland to spell out clearly the type of changes that are necessary to tackle the democratic void that continues to exist.  These include the need to devolve power to the lowest level possible. For instance, there is no reason to concentrate decision making in Brussels or Dublin if it can be more effectively carried out at local level instead.  To enable local democracy to function it must have powers and resources on a statutory basis, subject only to consistency with overall strategic planning. Similarly there should be adequate provision for regional, community and other non-governmental citizens' groups to make an input into discussion and decision making at the appropriate level.</P>
    <P>At a national level, it is vital that national parliaments should have detailed knowledge of and control over their Governments and Ministers' stance at Council of Minister level.  The corollary of this is that the EP should have a co-decision making role with community legislation submitted in advance to the Dáil for consideration while negotiations are still proceeding and while it is being <Col N="1335" /> in turn considered by the European Parliament's committees.</P>
    <P>The heads of Government and Council of Ministers meetings should also be public, and in Ireland Ministers should consult beforehand and report afterwards to a European Affairs Committee on meetings of the Council of Ministers. The same committee should monitor implementation by Ireland of EC directives. The Oireachtas itself should receive regular detailed reports from the European Affairs Committee on European developments for consideration. None of these proposals or any other proposals, even in broad terms, has been incorporated into the new Treaty.  It is therefore incapable, as it stands, of being the basis for the democratic development of the Community.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of a common foreign policy, security and defence, the Government have clearly abdicated any attempt to influence developments.  The Taoiseach refused to articulate or specify the Government's proposals.  He spoke in general terms of defence of &ldquo;essential interests&rdquo; but they did not define what these are.  We now know the direction of the EC in relation to security and defence.  The Taoiseach has said nothing and has done nothing to offer an alternative, post Cold War perspective on this issue.</P>
    <P>We are now being inexorably sucked into association with the Western European Union and NATO.  In this regard it is worthwhile recording that the total military spending of the NATO allies is $459 billion, $120 billion more than the combined total of all other countries in Europe, the Middle East and north Africa.  In his speech this morning, the Taoiseach said the Treaty makes it clear that joint action by the European union will not be extended to defence issues. Yet under the common provisions of the Treaty, Article B states:</P>
    <P>The Union shall set itself the following objectives: to assert its identity on the international scene, in particular through the implementation of <Col N="1336" /> a common foreign and security policy which shall include the eventual framing of a common defence policy,</P>
    <P>I do not know who the Taoiseach is seeking to fool, but I suspect he imagines that no-one will read the Treaty very closely. He also said &ldquo;they will not oblige us to join an alliance or will not involve us in taking on obligations under the Western European Union Treaty or subscribing to policy platforms adopted by the Western European Union&rdquo;.  However, the Taoiseach agreed to paragraph 4 of Article D of the common foreign and security policy which states:</P>
    <P>The policy of the Union in accordance with the present Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain Member States under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and be compatible with [this is the key point] the common security and defence policy established within that framework.</P>
    <P>Under this Treaty, the European Community must develop a common security and defence policy compatible with the Western European Union and NATO. Who is the Taoiseach trying to fool?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said we should not object to a relationship between the EC and the Western European Union and NATO.  He suggests that this could be for a peacekeeping role.  This is an inexplicable proposal regarding an organisation which incorporates a commitment to nuclear weapons.  Indeed, NATO recently decided that it would also retain is chemical weapons.  The Taoiseach abdicated his responsibility to articulate a positive non-militaristic role for Europe at Maastricht.</P>
    <P>The Treaty ignores any possible alternative to developing a militaristic union to defend its interests, and Ireland stands mute and neutered.  If Ireland does not begin now to assert a position to the contrary, then a European army and an EC military superpower will be the result and how soon thereafter will it be before <Col N="1337" /> we see Irish soldiers in Third World countries, not serving as United Nations peace-keepers but in pursuit of the European version of the US's Monroe Doctrine as applied so effectively in Latin America.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear once again, as we stated in our document, <i>Towards a Democratic Europe,</i> published in November, The Workers' Party are not opposed to the development of a common European foreign and security policy <i>per se,</i> but we have argued and continue to do so, that Ireland should use its voice at Intergovernmental Conference level to seek to shift the focus of such policies.  This must mean using Ireland's particular experience to counter those who want to use the obsolete and undemocratic cold war institutions to create a new superpower, allegedly to defend European interests.</P>
    <P>Maastricht was a lost opportunity for the Community to turn away from seeking to create a new military superpower. Just when the cold war and the system of hostile military blocs has collapsed and become redundant, the peace dividend is being swiped from under the noses of the poor of Europe and the world.</P>
    <P>We have a choice to make at this juncture. On the one hand the Community has set in motion the development of a militaristic defence policy with maintenance of the existing nuclear arsenal of France and Britain and of political intervention in developing countries.  We can still insist that the Community can develop a policy which rejects the solution of international conflicts and crises and problems through the use of force. We can insist that the real threats to the security of the EC and the rich world generally lie in the poverty, underdevelopment, lack of democracy and destruction of the global environment under which the majority of the world's population live.  For Ireland to take up such a stance and argue it requires the development of a positive neutrality, and not one of being neutered.</P>
    <P>As part of such an approach it is essential that we insist that any transfer of powers in the area of foreign and security <Col N="1338" /> policy cannot take place until there are democratic institutions in place to control it and, at a minimum, that means co-decision for the European Parliament with the Council.</P>
    <P>Similarly the fate of the Community is inextricably linked to the fate of the newly independent countries of eastern Europe.  The course of development of democracy, economies and foreign policy in these countries will have major bearing on the Community's own security.  It is likely that at least some of these states will actively seek EC membership before the end of the century.</P>
    <P>The proposals represent almost total failure on the key questions of regional and social cohesion.  The outcome on the regional issue is even worse than we had feared.  The Irish Government have not even got a precise offer on EC Structural Funds as a bribe, and, in their stupidity, they have sided with the Thatcherite rump in preventing the development of an industrial policy which would have allowed intervention to direct European industry to the regions.  The British Government have been allowed to force the progressing of the Social Charter outside the Treaty into a sort of limbo, where enforcement will be almost impossible. The almost inevitable result is that economic and monetary union, a worthwhile endeavour as part of an overall package, will, without a specific programme for cohesion have disastrous consequences for the Irish economy, and particularly for unemployment levels in Ireland.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the position adopted of being co-conspirators with the other 11 members of NATO to develop the EC into a military superpower is a total abandonment of any Irish role in the development of a non-militaristic European security policy.  Given the new powers being accumulated at European level, the failure to grant co-decision or any real powers of control to the European Parliament is an anti-democratic step backwards.  The concentration of powers outside the Community structure proper and into the hands of the Council and other intergovernmental mechanisms is highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> The conclusions of the Maastricht Summit, should not, in my view, be submitted to the Oireachtas or to the people for ratification.  Instead, this House should insist that an inter-institutional conference be convened of the Commission, the Parliament and the Council to revise the proposed amendments to the Treaty.  Since the Irish representatives at the negotiations so far have been either incompetent or untrustworthy, the European Affairs Committee should contribute actively to such a revision on behalf of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that there is no going back in the sense of leaving the European Community.  The Dáil, therefore, must insist that the Maastricht Treaty be amended.  We cannot afford to come back here in five or ten years' time with living standards probably below what they are now.  We must not allow the Community to develop politically at an even further remove from its citizens. We must not accept the development of a new European nuclear superpower.</P>
    <P>The Treaty as it stands allows, indeed facilitates, the emergence of all three of those developments.  It should be amended before being put to a referendum of the Irish people.  The Workers' Party, therefore, do not accept this Treaty as it currently stands.  It is a recipe for political, economic and social disaster.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill, 1991: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is threefold.  By its enactment, the National Development Corporation will be amalgamated with the Industrial Development Authority, and its assets, liabilities and commitments will consequently be transferred to the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for a number of amendments to the Industrial <Col N="1340" /> Development Act, 1986.  These will allow the Industrial Development Authority to hold or dispose of stocks, shares and securities transferred from the National Development Corporation.  The proposed amendments will also increase the financial limits relating to the aggregate amount of grants which may be made to the IDA by the Exchequer, as well as extend the applicability of employment grants to all industry.  Additionally, the IDA are being given greater power in relation to the holding of preference shares, and the power to hold shares in their own name.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill will increase the aggregate financial limits applicable to SFADCo which are contained in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company (Amendment) Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>It is the second and third of these objectives which makes it a matter of some urgency that the Bill be enacted before the Christmas recess.  One of the amendments which I propose making to the Industrial Development Act, 1986, has to do with the aggregate amount of capital grants that I can make to the IDA so that they can, basically, carry out their mandate.  This aggregate limit was set by section 14 of the 1986 Act at £700 million. The capital grants concerned are used by the IDA to meet their administrative expenses and to discharge their obligations or liabilities of a capital nature and are, of course, the basic resources used by the Authority to fulfil their statutory functions.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that the IDA will, by the end of 1991, have utilised £688 million of the limit, and it is expected that the £700 million limit will be exhausted in a few weeks' time &mdash; certainly before the Dáil reconvenes in January.  It is, therefore, critically necessary that the limit be raised now, so that the Authority can continue to carry out their statutory functions without interruption.  The proposal in section 9 of the Bill is to raise the aggregate limit to £1,200 million, which will enable the IDA to continue assisting industry, without recourse to the Oireachtas for legislation for a further period of five years approximately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> The same difficulty arises in the case of Shannon Development.  The last occasion on which legislation increasing the company's financial limits was enacted was June 1986, and the limits concerned were actually reached in Shannon's case at the end of last month.  Thus, it is equally urgent that the aggregate limits applicable to SFADCo should also be raised as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As far as SFADCo is concerned, section 10 of the Bill provides for: (1) an increase from £130 million to £150 million in the aggregate amount that the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares in the company; and (2) an increase from £105 million to £150 million in the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid, voted annually, which may be made to the company.</P>
    <P>Share capital subscribed to the company is used for capital expenditure on the industrial estate at Shannon and in the mid-west region.  The main elements of expenditure are land acquisition, construction of factories and ancillary works. The grant-in-aid moneys are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to companies on the Shannon Industrial Estate.</P>
    <P>Turning back to more general issues, Deputies will be aware that the Industrial Policy Review Group which I established last June are due to complete their report very shortly.  I assure the House that I intend to take all appropriate action open to me once it becomes available. Deputies should not confuse this Bill with any measures which the review group may recommend as I propose to deal with these swiftly at a later stage.  The reason for proceeding with the Bill at this time stems from the fact that the statutory limits on the grant-giving powers of both the IDA and SFADCo are just about exhausted, and new legislation is required to extend them.  Furthermore, by amalgamating the National Development Corporation with the IDA, I am continuing the process of rationalisation and refinement of the State's industrial promotion activities.</P>
    <P>The <i>Review of Industrial Performance,</i><Col N="1342" /> published in December of last year, drew attention to the large number of promotional measures undertaken by different State agencies, the increasing use of equity by the IDA in assisting companies, and the move to a situation in which up to 50 per cent of financial supports to medium and large indigenous industry would be in the form of equity or other remunerating forms of aid.  The review also pointed to the improved flow of equity into Irish industry through private venture capitalists, the smaller companies market and the Irish Stock Exchange generally.</P>
    <P>Such developments have lessened the justification for a separate State agency mandated to promote equity investment. It has become difficult to distinguish NADCORP's developmental role from that of the IDA.  Furthermore, with the IDA increasingly taking equity in projects it supports, as well as imposing stricter conditions relating to job performance and repayability of grants, any distinction between the two agencies on the grounds of commerciality is somewhat nebulous.  By 1993, IDA shareholdings are likely to be considerably greater than anything to which NADCORP could aspire.</P>
    <P>The review concluded that in order to provide a more cohesive and integrated approach to State equity investment in enterprise, the activities of the corporation and the Authority should be more closely integrated.</P>
    <P>The legislation now before the House is the latest in a series of significant developments which have taken place since 1987 in the restructuring of the State agencies involved in industrial development and promotion.  Other such restructuring included: the establishment of FáS to take over the functions previously undertaken by AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the National Manpower Service; the merger of the National Board for Science and Technology and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to form Eolas, a single agency with responsibility for the development, application, co-ordination and promotion of science and technology <Col N="1343" /> in Irish industry; and the merger of Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council to ensure that the State provides marketing support to Irish companies from a single source.</P>
    <P>The integration of the activities of the National Development Corporation with those of the IDA is a logical step in this process of restructuring of our industrial development mechanisms.  I should now like to trace some of the history of the corporation and the changing circumstances within which its continued existence as a separate entity no longer remains appropriate.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation was established under the National Development Corporation Act, 1986.  Its primary objective, as set down in section 10 of that Act, was to establish, invest in or manage any enterprise which the corporation considered to be profitable and efficient, or capable of becoming so.  It was also mandated to establish an investment fund, known as the &ldquo;Revolving Investment Fund for Employment&rdquo;, into which was paid any money realised on investments, dividends and any profits earned by the corporation.  The fund was intended to be used to fulfil any investment objects of the corporation.</P>
    <P>To date, NADCORP have invested approximately £26 million and currently hold shares in 57 companies which employ around 2,000 people.  Their performance has, however, fallen below expectations, with the corporation rarely drawing down their budget allocation.  It is generally accepted that State support is necessary to encourage new developments and to help offset the various dis-economies facing Irish industry.  However, State support can take a number of different forms, such as grants, equity or repayable advances.  The only essential distinguishing factor of the different forms of State support is whether the aid is &ldquo;free&rdquo; or remunerating.</P>
    <P>In January 1990 I took the opportunity, at the launch of a promotional video, to emphasise NADCORP's developmental role, with the corporation participating as an integral part of the Government's <Col N="1344" /> overall industrial development strategy. While the private venture capital market was relatively underdeveloped when NADCORP was established, in the intervening years there had been a significant growth in venture capital support mechanisms. I pointed out that it was necessary to reassess NADCORP's role with a view to increasing the focus on developmental and strategic projects.</P>
    <P>I expressed the view then that there was a need for a switch in emphasis, with NADCORP becoming more developmental while retaining a long term commercial objective.  There was, and still is, a pressing need for the development of certain indigenous sectors of strategic national importance, such as indigenous electronics and software.  I indicated that an important objective for me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, would be to integrate NADCORP's operations more fully into the central focus of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>As of 30 September of this year, the IDA held both ordinary and preference shares in some 113 companies amounting to a total value of £21 million.  This amount is likely to increase significantly in the next few years as the IDA, in order to ensure a better return for the State's investment in the development of industry, are increasingly using this form of support to indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>I believe, in the light of these considerations, that there is no case for the continuation of NADCORP as a separate entity.  One of the purposes of this Bill is to merge their activities with those of the IDA.  This will provide a more coherent and integrated approach to State equity investment.  Allied to this are the proposals contained in the Bill to allow the IDA to hold or dispose of stocks, shares and securities transferred from the National Development Corporation. IDA will be permitted to hold more than 50 per cent by way of preference shares and will also be given the power to hold shares in its own name.  Such shares were previously held in the name of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In merging the activities of the two agencies I do not propose to extend the <Col N="1345" /> IDA's existing remit, which enables it to invest in industrial and international service activities.  While NADCORP's mandate was somewhat broader, allowing them to invest also in most commercial undertakings, their investments were in the main concentrated in manufacturing companies.  Nevertheless, section 7 of the Bill will allow IDA to invest by way of the purchase or taking of shares in enterprises where NADCORP currently have holdings to which the IDA's remit does not extend.  It is intended that all NADCORP's property, rights and liabilities will transfer in the first instance to IDA.  Subsequently, insofar as SFADCo and údarás na Gaeltachta are charged with responsibility for development in regions where certain NADCORP holdings are situated, such holdings will be transferred to SFADCo or údarás na Gaeltachta as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the preparation of the final accounts of NADCORP and their presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As is usual in legislation of this sort, there is a provision in the Bill to exempt the IDA from the payment of stamp duty in respect of the properties and rights transferred to them under this Bill.  There are also provisions to ensure the continuity of any contracts and agreements entered into by NADCORP and to ensure that any legal proceedings to which the NADCORP is a party will not be brought to a halt on account of the transfer of NADCORP's assets and liabilities to the IDA.  The rights and liabilities transferred by the Bill may be sued on and recovered by and from the IDA.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, I propose, with the agreement of the House, to make a number of amendments to the Industrial Development Act, 1986.  I have already referred to the urgent need to raise the aggregate grant giving limits permitted by law.  In addition to these, and amendments stemming directly from the amalgamation of NADCORP with the IDA, I also intend, for example, to extend eligibility for employment grants from the current restriction to small industry to all industry.  Small industry is defined for this <Col N="1346" /> purpose as companies employing fewer than 50 people and with fixed assets of less than £800,000.  The IDA have found that employment grants, which are more targeted on employment <i>per se</i> and less on the acquisition of fixed assets, can provide a useful additional flexibility in their industrial promotion activities.  This is also in accordance with the commitment made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to widen the use of such grants.</P>
    <P>The Bill also amends the provision of the Industrial Development Act, 1986, which requires that shares purchased or taken by the IDA shall be registered in the name of the Minister for Finance. This requirement does not exist in relation to the existing NADCORP portfolio. I believe that the provision in the Industrial Development Act, 1986, concerned acts as a disincentive to the increased use of investment by IDA in their industrial promotion activities. Consequently, the Bill provides for the transfer to the IDA of shares which have been purchased by the IDA but are currently held in the name of the Minister for Finance.  The IDA will also be given the power to retain all amounts representing the dividends from these shares.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise to the House that industrial policy must be seen in its broadest sense as including all of the factors through which public policy can influence industrial development.  It is not just a question of Government and State agencies providing industrial incentives but must of necessity include the active participation of all players in the economy &mdash; employers, employees and consumers.  As I pointed out in the preface to the <i>Review of Industrial Performance</i> last December, I will continue to make further changes in our industrial policy as are required.  The full range of promotional and advisory activities must be subjected to a continuing system of objective evaluation which relates expenditure undertaken to defined objectives and measures of performance.  I will be keeping under consideration the possibility of further refinement of our policies <Col N="1347" /> with particular emphasis on the need to develop a strong indigenous industrial sector.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that I established the Industrial Policy Review Group last June to examine all aspects of public policy which impinge on industrial development, including the taxation system, PRSI, manpower, education, training and industrial supports.  The group have been concentrating on the development of Irish-owned companies and examining how policy could be adjusted to boost the development of indigenous industry in the medium and long term.  I expect to receive their report shortly and I will act on it with all necessary speed.</P>
    <P>The actions which I am now proposing do not in any way detract from whatever actions may be necessary as a result of the group's report.  They are very relevant and will ensure further progress in refining our range of industrial incentives. They will also ensure that we can maintain a flexible response allied to securing the best possible value for the expenditure of scarce State resources.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would just re-iterate the particular difficulties which make it necessary to have the Bill enacted as soon as possible &mdash; in other words, the issue of the exhaustion of the aggregate grant limits applicable to both IDA and Shannon Development.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In over 20 years in this House I have not witnessed more incompetence or a more undemocratic procedure than is attached to the introduction of this Bill.  As the House is probably aware, the Whips meet on a Thursday and agree among themselves the business to be conducted in the following week.  The Whips met on Thursday last and agreed business for this week.  I do not know whether it is with the Minister, his Department, or where the incompetence lies, but on Friday last they decided they wanted this Bill in a hurry and insisted on the Whips agreement being changed.  This House cannot <Col N="1348" /> operate on the basis of diktat from Government.  There must be agreement between the Whips as to what business is to be conducted on whatever are the number of sitting days the following week.  I do not think I blame Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Government Chief Whip, too much in this respect, because he is new to the job.  However, if he allows himself to be bullied by Ministers and &mdash; or Departments in this manner into breaking his trust with other party Whips within 24 hours, he is on the road to ensuring that no progress will be made in relation to legislative matters in this House.</P>
      <P>This Bill is entitled an Act to provide for the dissolution of the National Development Corporation Limited and the transfer of its assets and liabilities to the Industrial Development Authority, to amend the Industrial Development Act, 1986, and so on.  The Minister must take the blame for the incompetence in his Department.  We are told the Bill is urgent because the IDA would otherwise run out of money before the resumption of the Dáil.  This is a State company on which we are depending to attract industry. We give them £700 million and the Minister discovers within a fortnight of the end of the year that they will run out of money within six weeks.  He has done nothing about it until the last moment and he is obstructing the normal democratic arrangements for the taking of legislation by insisting on the Bill being rushed through under guillotine. Obviously, the prime function of this Bill is not to dissolve NADCORP but to cover up the incompetence of the Minister in running his Department.  It must have been clear for the past 12 months that the IDA would need further funding before the end of the year.  We are constantly lectured by this Minister's party about reforming the Dáil, the supremacy of Parliament and the protection of democratic institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  This is absolutely <Col N="1349" /> disgraceful.  If Deputy Ahern continues to whip the Fianna Fáil Party in this manner I hope he has a very short reign; otherwise, this Parliament will quickly get into disarray.</P>
      <P>The Bill is primarily about covering up the incompetence of the Minister and his Department.  An advance copy of the Bill was posted to me in Cork on Friday last. It shows contempt for this House and its elected Members on the part of the Minister.  There is no excuse for it.  It shows indifference in regard to the democratic process.  It is all designed to cover up his mistake in not getting extra capital for the IDA earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael are opposing this Bill, which aims to provide for the dissolution of the National Development Corporation and the transfer of its assets to the IDA.  I did not understand until I heard the Minister's speech why there should be such urgency as to demand all Stages within a few hours.  The Bill was sent to me by special post and arrived on Monday morning.  It had not been mentioned at the Whip's meeting last Thursday.  Why is there such haste?  The Minister must have known that the IDA would run out of money before the end of the year. Obviously, the Bill to abolish the National Development Corporation was in the course of preparation and sections 9 and 10 were tacked on to deal with IDA and SFADCo funding.  It is a patchwork designed to cover up incompetence.  It is a year since the Minister first indicated changes in this area.  The provision of such little time for Opposition speakers to prepare for the debate does not augur well for the Minister's commitment to improve the role of Parliament in framing legislation.  Opposition speakers were treated with similar disdain by him and his Department in relation to the Competition Bill, which was also guillotined without adequate time for debate.  All this is from the Department who are supposed to be seeing to efficiencies in business. It seems the Minister is motivated more by opposition to anything that did not originate with Fianna Fáil than by an objective assessment of NADCORP and their potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> Last December the Minister published the <i>Review of Industrial Performance</i> and added his own preface to that review. The review was carried out within his Department but obviously the conclusions reached did not meet with the Minister's approval.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I too felt that the review focused too much on the institutions involved in industrial development and not enough on policy addressed to the strenghts and weaknesses of industry and services.  The least the Minister could do is to give us the rationale for his rejection of the Civil Service review of industrial performance.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also give us the rationale behind the Bill before us.  I had not realised until today that the primary purpose was to get extra money for the IDA.  In the preface to the <i>Review of Industrial Performance</i> the Minister stated that the activities of NADCORP and the IDA would be more closely integrated. He did not explain adequately what he meant by this or why he was adopting this policy.  Now he has gone further than closer integration by abolishing NADCORP and transferring their functions to the IDA.  Again, the Minister has not shown the basis on which he is taking that decision and why he is opting for the abolition of NADCORP rather than closer integration between the IDA and NADCORP.</P>
    <P>Since the <i>Review of Industrial Performance</i> was published last year the Minister has set up the Industrial Policy Review Group and is awaiting their report.  I welcomed the establishment of that group.  All those involved are people of very high standing and all are in the private sector.  As that group are due to report by the end of this year, is it necessary to introduce this Bill now, or could it await receipt of the review group's report?  Decisions on the future of NADCORP could then be taken within a co-ordinated approach to industrial policy.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of that committee state that they are &ldquo;to review and make recommendations on industrial policy in Ireland and on public policy <Col N="1351" /> generally as it affects industrial policy&rdquo;. Surely this means that the Industrial Policy Review group will be looking at all State agencies and making recommendations on them.  Suppose the review group decide that NADCORP should be kept and their role expanded.  In that case, are not the members of this group entitled to think that when the Minister set them up he was engaging only in window dressing?  Before they report to him he has made a decision on industrial policy which is reflected in this Bill.  There will not be many people of the calibre of those on this review group who will be anxious to serve in the future when they see the contempt with which the Minister treats them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made piecemeal and haphazard changes in the institutional arrangements for industrial development agencies.  This year he introduced a Bill to merge CTT and the Irish Goods Council into An Bord Tráchtála.  The Minister, in his preface to the <i>Review of Industrial Performance,</i> said he was looking at the marketing bodies for beef and fish, namely CBF and BIM, and he indicated that he might place their fuctions within the ambit of An Bord Tráchtála.  What is the Minister's current thinking on this? Is he awaiting the report of the new Industrial Policy Review Group before acting?  If so, why did he decide to abolish NADCORP?  If he is not awaiting the report, does he intend to bring in another Bill to amalgamate all the export marketing bodies and produce marketing agencies?  If so, when does he intend this? If not, have his views changed?  Have the Department of the Marine and the Department of Agriculture and Food warned him off on the basis of what they have, they hold, whether it is in the national interest or not?</P>
    <P>On what basis has the Minister assessed the performance of NADCORP and decided that they no longer serve a useful purpose?  Why does the Minister believe it is better to incorporate NADCORP's activities with the IDA?  Are there not different sets of objectives and criteria used in deciding whether to give grants <Col N="1352" /> or invest equity?  Who will make the decisions within the IDA under the Minister's proposed structures?  Will the same people who make the decisions to give grants now also decide what equity the IDA should invest in the future?  If so, is there not likley to be a conflict of interest in so far as the IDA staff are concerned and the possibility of delays from the point of view of investors?  I understand there are approximately six employees left in NADCORP.  Presumably the people who had the expertise and experience of making decisions during the five years NADCORP were in existence have now been employed by other institutions outside the public service sector.  I do not know if the experience of those people will be available to the IDA or whether they are employed by the IDA already. Somehow I would doubt this.</P>
    <P>The staff of the IDA could be placed in an invidious position in deciding whether to give priority to grants or equity funding.  Whose interests will the staff of the IDA have foremost in their minds, that of the IDA or the business, when deciding between equity investment and grants?  Furthermore, different skills are likely to be needed in deciding on a grant as opposed to an equity investment.  As I said, I understand that three-quarters of the staff of NADCORP have now left.  Therefore, their expertise has gone with them.  Despite the fact that the State had already trained, through NADCORP, a body of people with this expertise the IDA will have to again start building up a body of people with expertise. Different criteria may also have to be applied in deciding between grants and equity investment.  I hope the Minister will fully explain these issues so that we can evaluate properly what he is proposing.</P>
    <P>The only information I have on NADCORP's performance is contained in their annual reports.  These show that the portfolio of investments held on 31 December 1990 was valued at £19.2 million, compared to cumulative State funding of £5.246 million for sales out of its portfolio of investments.  This is not a bad record given the high risk nature <Col N="1353" /> of investments which NADCORP were expected to undertake.  Indeed it is particularly good when one compares their portfolio value of almost £20 million after five years in operation with that of the Allied Combined Trust, the venture capital arm of the Allied Investment Bank, of £40 million after almost 25 years in operation.  To have been able to fund the cost of failures in the first five years of their existence and to have contributed to the maintenance and growth of over 60 projects which were still surviving in March 1991, is a creditable performance. Rumour has it that the attitude towards NADCORP within the Department of Industry and Commerce altered dramatically after the change of Government in 1987.  Any enthusiasm for the corporation which existed there before the change of Government certainly did not exist there afterwards.  The impression was given that the Department and Government of the day were anxious to see NADCORP run down and abolished, as is being proposed here today.</P>
    <P>Even more important than the financial performance of NADCORP is the role they played in helping to develop elements of the capital market in Ireland which were not very well developed when NADCORP were set up in 1986.  This point was also made by the Minister. Venture capital is a relatively recent form of financing available in Ireland.  In a country where familiarity with business activity in financial institutions is not as well developed as in larger, more developed countries, there are often difficulties in obtaining funding from banking sources.  The venture capital market route can be used to help business which would not be able to get off the ground or would not survive because of under-capitalisation.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister has carried out an assessment of the venture capital market operations and facilities available in Ireland.  Does he believe that the present market &mdash; he seemed to indicate in his speech that he does &mdash; is sufficiently developed to maximise the performance levels of business?  Does he <Col N="1354" /> believe the present venture capital market potential is being met by existing private sector sources?  I do not believe this is the case because over the past 15 years there has been pressure from institutions, the public and some politicians to have the large funds accumulated by banks, building societies and pension funds, put into venture capital companies so that they can re-invest this money in the future in companies who would otherwise find it difficult to obtain capital.</P>
    <P>It seems that many of these companies &mdash; I know of three but there are probably many more than that &mdash; have changed in the past 18 months or two years and are no longer venture capital companies interested in investing in manufacturing industry to create jobs or help manufacturers who could not obtain the capito get off the ground.  These venture capital companies no longer seem to be interested in doing that.  Rather they seem to be investment companies who invest in existing businesses and have shares, a practice purely motivated by profit.  They are entitled to do that and if their directors and shareholders believe they should change their method of operation from venture capital to investment that is a matter to be decided by the board of the company.  However, this means there is now a hole in the venture capital market which previously was filled by NADCORP.  A number of bank funded venture capital companies &mdash; I do not want to name them here but they are quite well known &mdash; are now more interested in investing in existing businesses and the distribution sector than they are in helping manufacturers.  The one strong point in favour of NADCORP was the amount of money they invested in manufacturing which, as the Minister said, helped to create over 2,000 jobs. Their record in this area compares favourably with that of any other State agency.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister envisage a real role for the IDA in taking over the activities of NADCORP or is he purely using the IDA take-over of NADCORP activities as a backdoor means of abolishing any <Col N="1355" /> role for the State in the venture capital area?  If he does envisage a continuing role for the State in this sphere, what grounds does he have for taking the view that the State's role would be fulfilled more efficiently and effectively through the IDA than through NADCORP?</P>
    <P>The IDA's existing role in equity involvement in business appeared to be a means of topping up funding for projects which had exhausted capital, and training grants, low rent facilities, cheap loans and other forms of assistance.  That type of equity investment, which really is a means of disguising State financial assistance, is surely very different from the venture capital role fulfilled by NADCORP?  I believe this is a mistake as the IDA are too big, too impersonal and too grant-orientated to fulfil NADCORP's role.  NADCORP could also undertake investment in projects in which other venture capital firms might have been reluctant to get involved because of the long pay back period.  It is important to point out that NADCORP's pay back period was much longer than that of normal venture capital companies. I should like to know the guidelines and criteria the Minister has set out for future IDA operations in this area.</P>
    <P>Is there not a possibility that the different roles the IDA are being asked to undertake will be clouded by asking them to get involved in venture capital as well as investment promotion through grants and other incentives?  In this regard I want to refer to a brochure entitled European Investment Regions which I recently received from <i>The Economist</i> Intelligence Unit.  They said they were pleased to announce a new series of reports examining Europe's most dynamic regions.  They refer to Wales, two regions in France, Catalonia in Spain, and Portugal but do not make any reference to Ireland.  There may be a good reason Ireland is not included in reports examining Europe's most dynamic regions for investment.  I would like to have an explanation from the Minister or the IDA, as I think we are entitled to have it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> One cannot help thinking that the Minister has fallen prey to the civil servants in this Bill.  The review of industrial performance which he published last year was written from a Civil Service point of view.  It seemed to be based on the objective of what institutional arrangements would best suit the Department of Industry and Commerce as the Department to which agencies report.  Hence, the report emphasised the desirability of one big agency in industrial development. I am not convinced that this is the most desirable way to handle the multifaceted issues facing businesses in different parts of the country.  The Minister, last December, did not equally appear to be convinced by the review. Now he has gone back, no doubt because of pressure from his Department, to dissolve NADCORP and put it in with the IDA which, apparently from the review of industrial performance last year, was not his original intention.</P>
    <P>Another inconsistency which I detect within the Minister's operation of industrial policy is the contradictory stance he takes on regional industrial development agencies.  If the Shannon Development Authority and údarás both do a good job in promoting development in their respective regions then similar bodies should be established for other regions. If they do not do an efficient and effective job then something should be done about that?  Why should the mid-west have its own regional agency when other parts of the country, with similar circumstances, do not?  The Minister in this Bill is extending the enabling legislation to further grant-aid the mid-west Shannon Development Authority.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to apologise for raising this matter under this Bill.  The argument for regional development can be extended to different regions of the country. For reasons of familiarity with the region, and also because it is part of my constituency, I could see where an equivalent organisation to the Shannon Development Authority, through redirection of IDA resources, could develop a co-ordinated plan for the Cork-south west region based on Cork Port, <Col N="1357" /> Cork Airport, Cork Harbour, the educational institutions in the area and the general background of industrial development which has been there for centuries.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on the issue of regional agencies. There is no doubt, given the high level of unemployment in the Cork region that it needs special attention.  In the mid-eighties a special task force was established by the then Government to help overcome the high unemployment at that time.  Now unemployment is far higher and there has been no response from the Government.  A locally based and managed development authority with all the power of SFADCo should be established to promote and develop the Cork region.  If the Minister does not take steps to establish regions like SFADCo in Cork and other parts of the country then Dublin will certainly continue to over balance industrial development in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which the Minister endorsed earlier this year it was stated that the job targets for the duration of the programme in manufacturing and industrial services would be 20,000 jobs a year.  I do not know what progress has been made towards that figure but I cannot see that this Bill will be of any assistance in helping us to reach that target.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Fine Gael are opposing this Bill because the Minister has not shown any basis as to why it is necessary to abolish NADCORP and have their activities transferred to the IDA.  The Minister has not produced an objective analysis of NADCORP's activities and the reasons the IDA would perform better.  The Minister has not shown whether he believes the State should have a role in equity investment.  The Minister has given no indication of his assessment of whether private venture capital markets are operating efficiently and effectively and no longer require a State input. The Minister has changed his mind on NADCORP since last year when he published the review on industrial performance, when he talked of closer <Col N="1358" /> integration with the IDA and now he proposes the abolition of NADCORP. No justification has been put forward for that change by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister is awaiting the report of the industrial policy review group and has taken an isolated decision on NADCORP without the benefit of the report. Since coming into office over two years ago the Minister, as I indicated earlier, has done nothing to develop a new industrial policy.  He has re-arranged deck chairs like amalgamating CTT and the Irish Goods Council but there have been no initiatives of an imaginative nature. We have no information from his Department on GATT and its likely impact on business.  We have had nothing from the Minister on how economic and monetary union will affect business.  We have had nothing from the Minister on new approaches to State industrial policy. New approaches are needed now more than ever.  We have heard nothing in the last 24 hours from the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the effects the single European currency will have on the other effects the decisions taken at Maastricht will have on this country except that in his role as leader of the Progressive Democrats, he welcomed what was agreed at Maastricht.</P>
    <P>I hope the report of the review body makes up for the lack of policy development within the Minister's Department. For these reasons Fine Gael are signalling their dissatisfaction by opposing this Bill. Furthermore, the unseemly haste with which the Minister wanted the Bill debated and passed suggests an unwillingness to want to hear views on State industrial policy being advanced, an overly defensive attitude but one, given the Government's poor performance in this area, which is, perhaps, understandable.</P>
    <P>I prepared these notes yesterday before I understood the real reasons for the Minister's haste in looking for this Bill.  I repeat the point I made in relation to the incompetence of the Department and the Minister coming in here with a Bill when they must have known for 12 months that the IDA would need more <Col N="1359" /> money before January 1992.  They left it almost to the last day and upset arrangements in this House which have been traditional for over 70 years &mdash; where there was agreement between Whips on business for the following week &mdash; and bulldozed this Bill through the House in a short space of time under the cloak of abolishing NADCORP instead of doing their business properly and bringing in an IDA (Amendment) Bill which would increase IDA capital and that of SFADCo.  That would have been the correct procedure but it should have been done long before now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Barry has rightly pointed out there are two distinct aspects to this Bill.  The first is to provide the additional funding for the IDA and SFADCo which is understandable and acceptable.  It should have been the subject of a separate Bill and not drawn in with a disconnected and very serious matter so far as the Labour Party are concerned, the final abandonment of what NADCORP was supposed to have been all about.  There was no necessity to rush through the NADCORP element of this Bill.  Funding for the IDA and SFADCo could and should have been dealt with in a separate measure.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the Labour Party are totally opposed to this legislation.  The decision of the Government to abolish NADCORP is both obtuse and shortsighted. The dissolution of NADCORP is a totally retrograde step and an abandonment of the commitment implicit in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to have an active interventionist industrial policy in the development of indigenous Irish companies and the creation of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I should say the dissolution of NADCORP comes as no surprise, as all the signs were there since the beginning of this year that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was set on abolishing this corporation.  Earlier this year decisions were taken at Government level which included a cut of nearly 50 per cent in the allocation decided for <Col N="1360" /> NADCORP in the 1991 Estimates, reducing the company's financial allocation for investment purposes from £3.5 million in the abridged book of estimates to £2 million in the budget.  It became clear to the Labour Party that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had decided, literally to starve NADCORP to death.</P>
    <P>The decision now to finally abolish NADCORP is an ominous and in many ways a tragic development.  Although NADCORP were never given the opportunity to grow as we originally envisaged, they have played a valuable and useful role in the risk capital market especially in terms of helping indigenous Irish companies to get off the ground, to grow and develop.  They were established at a time when there was a demand for risk capital to help enterprises get established and thus to help the process of job creation. Subsequent to their establishment, more venture capital was needed in the economy, coinciding with some economic growth, an easing of bank credit and tax concessions via the BES scheme.  All of these trends are now in reverse and the demand for risk capital is on the increase, precisely at the very moment the Government have chosen to abolish the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>In the years in which it existed NADCORP invested successfully in a wide range of industrial sectors and projects, including high technology, engineering, food manufacturing, natural resources, health care and tourism.  They became a key player in the development of indigenous industry and they should have been encouraged rather than decimated.</P>
    <P>The IDA have an on going programme to develop 100 selected indigenous companies intended to reach a turnover of in excess of £5 million a year.  Unfortunately, past experience with such successful companies tells us that they are likely targets for acquisition by international companies.  The IDA have highlighted this weakness in our industrial policy.  NADCORP, with the necessary political will and funding, could have had strategic equity participation in these <Col N="1361" /> companies and helped them through long term finance to reach the next critical stage of development.  If this Government were not driven by a blinkered opposition to a policy of targeted intervention by the State in industry, the Irish food sector, for example, with NADCORP acting as the change agent would now be transformed into two or three companies that could have sales in excess of £1 billion per annum.  Instead we are left with the legacy of the Goodman and Greencore scandals without any Government policy instrument for the food industry.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Telesis report in 1981 we have had a total failure by the conservative parties to implement its recommendations.  There seems to be an urge to get new reports and to commission new review bodies to no end. The reports are discussed in the House, questions were asked in the Dáil; but at the end of the day the recommendations are not adopted and all the effort and energy given to drawing up the reports fall by the wayside.  The Telesis report pointed out that the resources of the State devoted to industrial investment were far too concentrated on foreign manufacturing firms, the majority of which were not stand alone facilities with a research and development capacity.  Telesis suggested that over a ten year period the £18 million pounds a year of State money for industrial development should be switched towards the growth of strong indigenous companies with sufficient size and scale of operations to generate an increase in sustainable long term employment.</P>
    <P>If we recall the hostility of the apostles of the new Right who attacked the concept of the State having any policy on intervening in industry except to create the so called correct climate for investment, despite its manifest failure, is it not a condemnation and an indictment of this Government that they are persisting with this failed policy?</P>
    <P>Employment in manufacturing industry is forecast to decline over the next five years according to the medium term <Col N="1362" /> economic review of the ESRI.  The bankruptcy of the &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; approach is privately accepted by a number of Government Ministers and former Govenment Ministers.  Indeed, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, publicly stated, while still Minister for Finance, that the employment strategy we should adopt is that followed by Sweden and the Nordic countries.  Yet the revised <i>Programme for Government,</i> negotiated recently states as the first plank of Government policy on job creation, the maintenance of an economic climate conducive to growth and investment.  Deputy Reynolds accepted that our reliance on foreign inward investment was a short sighted approach.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party see the National Development Corporation as a possible agent for change in restructuring Irish industry, with a dynamic and co-ordinated role for the State sector in a holding corporation.  Given the failure of the EC to take action to force the richer member states to reduce their incentive packages for industrial investment, We must have a &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; approach with a coherent Government strategy to nurture, encourage and sustain the growth of selected indigenous companies in the private sector and in the State companies.</P>
    <P>The real problem is not that the Fianna Fáil wing of the Government believe in relying on the market to generate jobs. Indeed the Taoiseach was out at Maastricht looking for legally binding commitments on wealth and resource transfers to Ireland.  Even the Progressive Democrats are socialists when it comes to the question of regional and social policies to address the failure of the market mechanism to distribute wealth, income and jobs evenly.  However, at home the fundamental handicap this country faces it the business veto. Despite the commitments which the ICTU secured in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on the development of indigenous industries, the Government have the nerve to come in here and propose the abolition of the very established to carry out those very <Col N="1363" /> very objectives.  The business veto operates in Ireland in this way:&mdash; all free money such as grants are to be kept in place, while total opposition is expressed to the very idea of State equity participation either on sound investment or value for money criteria, or more particularly for strategic and employment considerations.</P>
    <P>Politically, this Government, and indeed successive Governments, have had changes in industrial policy vetted by the IDA to stop any incentive opposed by the multinationals.  It is only the intervention of the European Commission that secured the introduction of the modest 10 per cent tax on corporation profits.  Five weeks ago the Taoiseach said that everything in the state sector was being examined for privatisation. Since 1987 employment in the State commercial companies has declined every year.  So much for the commitment to the ICTU to develop the State sector.  This Bill is clearing the way for the privatisation of the remainder of the State sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech says:</P>
    <P>I will be keeping under consideration the possibility of further refinement of our policies with particular emphasis on the need to develop a strong indigenous industrial sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to fine tune what we have.  The economy, the degree of employment it provides and the degree of unemployment it tolerates are not matters for refinement or fine tuning.  This is a crisis, and the Minister and the Government should recognise the crisis in employment and in the economy.  In response to that crisis we get only review bodies talking about refinement.</P>
    <P>We have the highest unemployment percentage rate in the Twelve.  Is that really necessary?  Do we have to have it? Why does the Minister not admit that we need a radical change in direction, a change in our policies for job creation? Why does he not admit that this is a crisis and come up with major proposals? <Col N="1364" /> Instead there is this whimper, the statement that he will bring in a refinement, a fine tuning.  A fine tuning of a disaster area?  One does not fine tune disasters. One avoids them, having realised in the first instance that something is rotten in the system.</P>
    <P>What is it that is wrong?  It is the whole basis of the approach of the three Right wing parties in the State to the economy. The National Development Corporation concept was a Labour Party concept. Unfortunately, when the Labour Party were in Coalition Fine Gael were not enthusiastic to see the National Development Corporation operate in the way that the Labour Party envisaged.  It is interesting to hear Deputy Barry say he is opposing the abolition of NADCORP.  It is regrettable that at that earlier time his party did not nurture it and, through the then Minister for Industry, give it the resources and backing to achieve the dynamic that we knew, and still know, it could achieve.</P>
    <P>Let us face the fact that the provision of employment can only come from either of two possible wings of the economy, the private sector and the public sector.  There is none other.  We have heard so much about the atmosphere and the climate.  They have been building up the climate from the days of former Taoiseach Lemass all the way up to Minister O'Malley.  With what result?  We have 300,000 unemployed, the highest percentage unemployment rate in all the 12 EC countries.  What happened to this climate? With all this work and all this attention to the climate we have become top of the unemployment league.  Can somebody explain why that should be so after all the efforts at climate control that have been the directing force and the dynamic of economic policy through the series of Governments we have had and culminating in this present one?</P>
    <P>If there was at least a recognition of the fact that what we have is unacceptable, that it is a disaster and that there must be a major change of direction, it would be something.  For decades we have relied on the private sector to provide the employment we need here. <Col N="1365" /> Economic development in this country, in Europe and in the world is cyclical. There are booms and slumps.  If we were honest with ourselves we would have to concede that never in the history of this State did we ever provide anything approaching the level of employment we need, and as the years go on the numbers get worse in actual terms and in percentage terms.  From having the third highest unemployment rate in the EC we went on to have the second highest, and now we have the dubious role of having the highest unemployment rate in the EC.  Still, nobody says that there is something wrong here and that it does not have to be that way.  But what do we do? We close our eyes, the blinkers come on and, like Mr. Micawber, we hope that something will turn up, that we will get something from the EC, that there will be emigration or whatever.  We carry on in the same old way.  That is what we have been doing year after year.  The unemployment rate goes higher and higher and we now have the highest rate in the EC.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say it, and I wish it was not so, but the private sector has failed and continues to fail to provide the employment we need.  That is not a political point.  It is not an argumentative point.  It is a simple fact.  The statistics show that the reliance placed on the private sector to come up with those jobs has got us nowhere.  With all the grants they have got, all the encouragements and all the tax concessions, they have never been able, for one reason or another, to provide the employment we need.  Facts are facts and one cannot get away from that.</P>
    <P>What do the Government propose to do about it?  What does the Minister propose to do about it?  He may ask what do the Labour Party suggest about it.  Our philosophy on the issue is different.  We accept that the private sector has a very important role to play and deserves every reasonable encouragement.  We are not saying that the private sector should be knocked or put down in any way.  I and the Labour Party heartily wish that the private sector had provided jobs.  More <Col N="1366" /> power to them if they did.  However, they have not; so there has to be a different way if we are not to accept the present situation and go on as we have done for decades tolerating the situation, providing social welfare, hoping for emigration. That is an approach, if one wants to adopt it.  But we in the Labour Party say that it does not have to be that way and that an active interventionist policy developed and built up over a period could make a major impact for good on unemployment and the economy.</P>
    <P>The sad fact is that it has never been tried.  There was never a Government, including the one in which the Labour Party was a minority party, that was committed to giving its all to developing an interventionist policy.  By that I do not mean gross nationalisation and that kind of thing; I mean a National Development Corporation that would be given full backing by the Government and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which would be funded and given the personnel, properly paid and provided with the resources, to get into the marketplace and stir it up.  The number of opportunities out there are legion.  There is no shortage of products to be made, no shortage of services to be provided. Since the private sector has failed to provide them, we have allowed foreign firms to come in and do it, and when they see the profits to be made they are not slow to do that and have done it in their hundreds.</P>
    <P>If one looks around the shops for products which could be made or developed here &mdash; everyday commodities &mdash; it is very had to find them.  That is a reflection on our private sector at a time when there are people who are ready, willing and anxious to work in factories to provide a service and product those items.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is considering whether he should further refine our policy.  Quite frankly, a refinement is not needed but rather a major change in approach.  We should take the National Development Corporation and use it to change things, create employment and set up new industries.  If needs be, this is <Col N="1367" /> what they should do.  Is that such a terrible thing?  The new Right shudder with horror at the idea that a State enterprise should intervene in that sacred marketplace which must be protected in its entirety for the private sector.  They almost have a heart attack at the concept, thought or idea that a State or semi-State company or a National Development Corporation should get involved &mdash; the horror of it all.</P>
    <P>They create this aura or atmosphere that it must be left to private enterprise who they say will do it at some stage, but these are the policies of failure and disaster which have resulted in 300,000 people being unemployed, and the number continues to rise.  As I said, if a private sector company are going well, more often than not they are sold off to a multinational, or merged with another company in the group.  When the multinational company concerned close down workers are laid off.  That is the reason the numbers have been shoved up to the 300,000 mark.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it has become difficult to distinguish NADCORP's development role from that of the IDA and that any distinction between the two agencies on the grounds of commerciality is somewhat nebulous.  If one accepts his policy it is very likely that is the position but the Labour Party would draw a major distinction between the role of NADCORP and the IDA.  They have a very important role to play and are doing some wonderful work.  Let them continue with that work and, indeed, more but the role we envisage for a National Development Corporation is quite different.  We see them being given an active interventionist role, if need be, on a majority, minority or parity basis &mdash; there would be no hard and fast rule &mdash; with each project being examined on its own merits.  I am not suggesting that they should throw money away on useless projects but there are dedicated people of skill who would be prepared, given Government and ministerial backing, to give projects their all.  They could do wonders if given that backing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> I do not know whether the private companies involved in the scandals and in the privatisation process are holding back the Government from intervening &mdash; perhaps they are exerting political and other pressure on them to make sure that this does not happen &mdash; but the Labour Party and I have no doubt, this forms a key integral part of our policy, that there is a very important, essential, major role for State and semi-State companies to play in the marketplace where the opportunities to substitute imports, let alone to increase exports, in the context of 1993, are immense.</P>
    <P>I fear for us in the run up to 1993 as we have had it bad up to now.  As you will remember, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as I am sure other Deputies will, motor assembly industries were big employers in my constituency.  Thousands of people were employed in those industries, many of whom have not worked since.  This came at the intermediate stage of the development of the EC.  A further belt around the head is to come after 1993. What will happen then?  My colleague has just reminded me that the textile industry has been very badly hit.  We want to hear what the Minister is going to do for that industry in the light of the recent recommendations.</P>
    <P>If we are to address our serious, critical problems a tremendous effort on the part of the private sector will be required along with a major input by the public sector.  We cannot expect a mish-mash, joined up company to do this given that the role played by the IDA is different. A high degree of expertise and specialisation will be required, in a separate corporation.  That is the reason NADCORP were set up.  More importantly, the enthusiastic backing of the Government of the day, in terms of personnel and resources, will be required.  It is useless leaving NADCORP as a shell.  We might as well merge or dissolve them because up until now they have not fulfilled the role envisaged for them by the Labour Party.  It is tragic that we have come to this, that we have failed to recognise what is needed and that we are now putting the final nail in the coffin of what <Col N="1369" /> was a first class concept in throwing NADCORP into the dustbin of history. The Government and the Minister will live to regret this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to generate enthusiastic opposition or, indeed, sentiments about this measure.  Even though it seems there is a role for the National Development Corporation to play, as originally intended, they have never been allowed to function in the manner envisaged.  Deputy Taylor is correct when he says there is a logical argument in favour of doing what is proposed here because they were strangled at birth. Since then the influence they have exerted on the economy has been minimalist.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor, quite properly, claimed authorship of the idea and concept for the Labour Party but it had an unhappy conception in that their then partner in Government did not agree with it.  Indeed, we had to wait a long time before legislation came before the House.  If I recall correctly the then Leader of the Labour Party was not exactly clear, at the famous press conference at which it was announced, as to what their purpose was.  It was difficult to hold his concentration at times but, ultimately, once the opposition of the Fine Gael Party was overcome the legislation was eventually introduced in the House in 1985.  Although the intention to establish the National Development Corporation was announced in 1981, it took until 1985 to introduce the legislation.  It was reported at the time that the legislation was very strongly opposed by Deputy John Bruton in particular.</P>

    <P>Arrears was one of the major problems in the taxation area inherited by the Government that took office in 1987. Since that year, radical action has been taken by the Government to deal with these problems.  The following measures have been taken: an amnesty was brought into effect in 1988; the phased development of the self-assessment system and accompanying audit programme for personal and company taxation was started; the basis of assessment for income tax and corporation tax was changed from a preceding year to a current year basis; a withholding tax on professional fees was introduced; tax clearance requirements were introduced for public contracts and grants; the system of tax enforcement <Col N="1371" /> by sheriffs was improved; the power to attach assets of tax defaulters has been granted to the Revenue Commissioners; and a collection initiative, funded by the allocation of £1 million in the 1991 budget, facilitated the collection of arrears remaining after the 1988 amnesty amongst other things.</P>
    <P>As well as the general measures which I have outlined above, a specific programme to review tax arrears which had not been discharged under the 1988 tax amnesty was launched soon after the effects of the amnesty was analysed.  The objectives of that programme were to agree or finalise the amount of liability, determine the most appropriate form of enforcement for collectible arrears and identify arrears which might be uncollectible, e.g. where businesses were defunct or where a taxpayer's whereabouts cannot be established.  The programme involved, among other things, direct personal contact with the taxpayer or taxpayer's agent.</P>
    <P>The extra resources provided in both the 1989 and 1991 budgets have enabled Revenue to build on and develop the original post-amnesty review of arrears. The programme will result in the collection of £30 million in entrenched preamnesty arrears in the current year.  As to results, all these measures are contributing to better collection and enforcement of tax obligations as evidenced by the ongoing reduction in outstanding amounts over the period, i.e.: 31/05/87 &mdash; £4,172 million; 31/05/88 &mdash; £4,107 million; 31/05/98 &mdash; £3,501 million; 31/05/90 &mdash; £2,985 million; 31/05/91 &mdash; £2,718 million. An overall reduction of £267 million, in the amount outstanding is noted for the most recent 12 month period reviewed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is also noted that this reduction occured in a period during which over £7,000 million in additional charges fell due for collection.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the figure of £2,718 million mentioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General must be considered in its proper context.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General <Col N="1372" /> points out, the Revenue Commissioners estimate that only £426 million of the £2,718 million is likely to be collected. The reason for the difference is that the figure of £2,718 million consists largely of estimates which were made by tax inspectors in the absence of returns from taxpayers.  Therefore, to quote a figure of £2,718 million without putting that figure into its proper context gives a misleading impression.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners' achievements in collecting £171 million of entrenched preamnesty arrears since 1989 is quite impressive when viewed against the figure of £426 million.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable success in recent years in dealing with arrears as detailed in this reply.  In 1992, the existing arrears programmes will be maintained and will yield a further £30 million of entrenched arrears.  In addition, I am considering the scope for further collection initiatives.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for his very lengthy reply. Could the Minister explain why, of the £2,718 million in outstanding taxes on 31 May 1991, Revenue expect to collect only £426 million?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of reasons for that.  Under the pre-assessment system, where a taxpayer did not make a return &mdash; and about 40 per cent of the self-employed made no return &mdash; the inspector of taxes had to make an assessment of tax due.  These assessments are almost always considerably greater than the amount due, and this has been proven in the last three or four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If an amount in excess of 80 per cent of the £2,718 million is uncollectible why is it not written off?  Why do Revenue continue to publish figures which give, as the Minister said, a very misleading picture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been considering that matter for the last few weeks.  There are a number of other issues involved. The old system was so inefficient that <Col N="1373" /> many of the assessments appealed were left in abeyance.  It took such a long time for Revenue to deal with these cases that a large number of the companies had gone out of business and were untraceable. At present the Revenue Commissioners are going through these arrears case by case and are writing off those they cannot follow through. However, it would not be acceptable to write off all of them.  Since the inception of this system in 1989 the section dealing with arrears have collected practically £200 million in old debts.  Therefore it is worth homing in on these old accounts for at least another 12 months, and a judgment will then have to be made whether to continue following them up. The arrears have been reduced by £1.5 billion in the last few years and if that figure of £200 million continues to decline and from looking at the profile of the arrears since 1987, I believe it will, it is unlikely that a great amount of money would be collected after the 12 months.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the people who are advising the Minister, both in Revenue and in his Department, estimated that less than £25 million was collectible under the terms of the amnesty, whereas between £600 million and £700 million was collected, would he be wary of advice from the same source now, that only a very small amount of outstanding taxes is collectible, considering that the advisers proved so widely wrong in the past?</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  The people in Revenue who advise me have put forward many arguments in answer to that question but I will not go into that now.  However, it is worth following up the remaining arrears for a limited time. Otherwise money which could be collected from people with very large debts may not be collected.  In reply to another question put down for today &mdash; we may not reach it &mdash; it is worth noting that one big fish was caught.  Therefore Revenue <Col N="1374" /> should not give in without following up the arrears to a reasonable extent, and that is what it is proposed to do.</P>

Let me state for the record because I know it is important, that subhead B.2 of the Vote for Third Level and Further Education provides a block grant to the Higher Education Authority to cover the non-capital requirement of all the relevant institutions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5, 21 and 106 together. Public service pay costs are set to increase by well over 10 per cent next year if all liabilities to public servants are to be met. Increased pay spending of this order on a continuing basis has serious implications in 1992 and beyond, if the targets for the Exchequer borrowing requirement set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in the Programme for Government are to be met.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the national debt to GNP ratio is to be reduced towards 100 per cent by 1993, and as part of this, broad balance on the current budget is to be achieved.  The target in the Programme for Government is for an EBR of not more than 1.5 per cent of GNP in 1993.  The Government are committed to adhering to those targets.</P>
      <P>There is widespread acceptance that corrective action is needed to deal with next year's budgetary problems.  On 8 October 1991, the Taoiseach, accompanied by the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Food, Social Welfare and myself, met the social partners in the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to discuss the general economic and fiscal situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following that meeting, the Government have undertaken a rigorous examination of departmental spending estimates for 1992.  In parallel with this process, a series of bilateral meetings has been held at official level with the social partners in order to identify how they might contribute constructively to finding solutions to our problems.  Following the conclusion of these meetings, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Labour met the employer organisations on 25 November 1991 to discuss various proposals in the areas of training and employment. A meeting between the Taoiseach and Ministers on the one hand and the ICTU on the other, has now been fixed for <Col N="1378" /> tomorrow to discuss various issues arising from the earlier bilateral discussions and the meeting with the employers in the context of the developing budgetary position.</P>
    <P>I also met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trades Unions on 22 November last.  At that meeting I outlined the difficult budgetary situation facing the Government for 1992 and the need to adhere to our targets for the EBR.  I indicated that in finalising the package of measures necessary to deal with that situation, the Government would be looking at all possible options &mdash; including public service pay &mdash; and all sectors of the economy.  I asked the ICTU representatives to meet me again the following week.  That meeting has not taken place.</P>
    <P>Pending conclusion of the discussions with the social partners, who are parties with the Government to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> it would not be possible for me to indicate the position which the Government will adopt on the matters referred to in the questions.</P>

Will the Minister, therefore, outline what other corrective measures are being implemented or examined to raise the money required to meet the commitments freely entered into by both Government and employers to meet the delayed payments, most of which have been delayed for at least four <Col N="1379" /> years?  Will the Minister agree that if the shoe was on the other foot and the unions were coming to him demanding that the pay element of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> be renegotiated to give their members an increase, he would tell them to get lost?</P>

The groups due special pay increases are teachers, gardaí, nurses, prison officers and junior hospital doctors.  These are very important groups in Irish life and not for two minutes would I argue against that.  The facts are that the special pay increases for next year amount to £77 million and the ordinary round will cost £110 million.  When they are taken together with the carry over aspects, the total pay bill will rise by well over 10 per cent, or £340 million.</P>
      <P>At the time of negotiating the pay elements of the programme, particularly of the general round, which I was involved in, the issue was based on a review of growth levels for each of the three years.  That is precisely the point I made to the unions when I met them on 22 November and the point I made this time last year and right through to when the discussions were completed on 13 January last.</P>
      <P>The issue of low pay is being examined in the bilateral discussions.  The Deputy also asked about employment and training programmes and the measures we propose to take to deal with tax evasion and avoidance and we hope to take more from the accumulated arrears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Wildlife Service do not have any proposals to introduce eagles.  However, a project to reintroduce the white-tailed sea eagle has been sponsored as a private venture by Eagle Star Life Insurance Company. White-tailed sea eagles have been extinct in Ireland since the early part of this century.</P>
      <P>Two pairs of eagles were imported from the German Raptor Centre, which is a private research centre for the breeding and preservation of raptor and owl species.  The four eagles were kept in quarantine at Fota Wildlife Park for two weeks.  The younger pair will be released in spring 1992 on Inismhicealáin in the Blasket Islands, which was a traditional breeding area for Sea Eagles.  The mature breeding pair will remain in a newly constructed aviary in Fota Wildlife Park. Their offspring will be released to the wild in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Licences to import the sea eagles were issued by the National Parks and Wildlife <Col N="1382" /> Service, Office of Public Works, to Fota Wildlife Park in September 1991.</P>

      <P>I first beg your indulgence, Sir, to wish the Minister of State well in his new position.</P>
      <P>In the context of the preservation and enhancement of the environment in general and of the Government's direction to double tourism numbers over a specified planned period, I ask the Minister whether he considers this to be a very worthwhile venture and whether, arising from that, he has instructed the Wildlife Service to carry out a survey of other suitable habitats on the west coast from Donegal to Kerry where there were other natural breeding grounds for the eagle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly consider the project to be very worthwhile. However, as I said, there are no plans at present to reintroduce eagles.  Reintroduction of a species is, of course, a major project, which would take considerable time and resources.  I know that the Deputy will, however, be very glad to hear that Mayo would be considered an excellent choice if it were decided to reintroduce eagles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to ask the Minister of State whether he would care to say why a small, somewhat obscure, island off the south-west coast appears to be geographically, historically and in many other ways suitable for the preservation of deer and the generation of electricity and now for the preservation and release of the eagle.  Therefore, I am glad to hear that the Minister is interested and does know that Eagle Island off the west coast of Mayo would indeed be very suitable.</P>

      <P>Very briefly in reply to Deputy Kenny, I should point out that the Taoiseach personally supported this project, which the Deputy correctly describes as being very worthwhile. Indeed, the Taoiseach made his own private island available as the first site for reintroducing eagles.  By the way, there were several nesting sites on the Blaskets <Col N="1383" /> and neighbouring islands in the previous century &mdash; yet another Kerry first.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I suppose that there is no danger of the eagles flying into the windmill when they are put down there?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State know of the concern in the neighbourhood that the eagles will not survive because of the practice of putting out poisoned meat as a method of pest control on the nearby mainland?  Has the Wildlife Service advised the sponsors of the project on that matter?</P>

      <P>The eagles project has been very well researched and the eagles have been trained to eat mainly fish, although they will also eat birds and other carrion. There is very little evidence that they would engage in killing lambs, for example.</P>

      <P>Under the current regulations governing the provision of Structural Fund aid the provision of housing is not eligible for assistance.  Indeed, there is no Community competence in relation to housing.  It has, however, been possible to put forward pilot proposals in relation to the training needs of the homeless in the context of the HORIZON Community Initiative, which I understand, is expected to be agreed by the EC Commission shortly.  The question of incorporating projects for the homeless within the scope of future Structural Fund spending may be considered when the regulations governing the post-1993 Structural Fund are being drawn up.  There have been no discussions to date with EC authorities on this issue.</P>

      <P>It may be a little soon, but perhaps the Minister is aware that in the Treaty conclusions of just the other day the annexe relating to the social dimension of the social charter indicated a willingness to deal with those referred to in Eurospeak as the &ldquo;excluded&rdquo;, which obviously includes the homeless.  Does the Minister perceive that annexe in any way assisting with the inclusion of the homeless under structural funding?  After all, it is also accepted in the various preambles to the Treaty provisions that the application of structural funding needs to be reviewed and made more effective in dealing with social as well as infrastructural matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that I have spent the past three weekends reading through the preambles and the Treaty.  During the first Structural Fund period from 1989 to 1993 an effort was made under the European Social Fund &mdash; about which Deputy De Rossa and I have spoken across the floor before &mdash;<Col N="1385" /> and the HORIZON programme originated there as an additional item.  That scheme makes particular efforts, but it is only for pilot schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the scheme there are about 140 projects amounting to £55 million.  This country will get its share, which will be small.  That initiative did identify the homeless.  The Deputy seems to be referring to the broader front, in asking whether an extension will be made under the Regional Fund.  From reading the document just last weekend I did not take that interpretation, but perhaps it is too early to do so.</P>
      <P>The interest, which I know of from my previous post, in the Euroform and HORIZON programmes shows that there is a Community initiative for this. The benefit is that the money goes directly to individual bodies rather than into the whole national regional structure. It is an issue worth consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with project work is that it is just that; there are specific projects but they do not necessarily examine the issues of homelessness in an integrated way.  That would be the reason the National Campaign for the Homeless in Ireland are anxious that the issue be taken on board as part of dealing with the whole question of cohesion, the social dimension and so on. Would the Minister support the idea of homelessness being dealt with under general regional funding or specific structural funding?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The best time would be when the various documents are presented and discussions being in the new year on Structural Funds, it could be an initiative taken then.  What might be useful would be that the experience gained from the HORIZON programme &mdash; showing that there is an interest in the matter &mdash; be included in those discussions at that stage.  I would be prepared to recommend that that information be advanced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Deputy Hogan when he raised this issue on a grievance motion on 19 November, I accepted that there is a lack of adequate regulation in respect of certain investment activities.  I pointed out that the 1989 Insurance Act regulates the activities of brokers when dealing in insurance products and provides protection for consumers in relation to insurance products, it does not, however, extend to other investment services which these brokers may provide.</P>
      <P>The draft EC Investment Services Directive will set out minimum requirements which will have to be met in this area.  As it is possible that the draft Directive could be delayed at Community level, I am at present considering whether to introduce regulatory measures in advance of its adoption.  The draft of the Investment Services Directive would require us to appoint a national regulatory authority for investment intermediaries and to draw up prudential rules to be observed by investment firms.  Legislation would be required to implement the necessary regulatory measures to ensure adequate protection for the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> The provision of compensation falls to be considered in the context of these regulatory measures.  In certain areas of the investment sector there is provision for limited investor compensation.  Persons placing money for investment on the exchange with stockbrokers, who are members of the stock exchange, are currently protected against the insolvency of a stockbroker up to certain limits.  The Insurance Act, 1989, also provides some protection for persons dealing with insurance brokers but only in relation to insurance products; it does not extend to other investment services which they provide.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that gaps in the present regulatory system be closed as quickly as possible.  Discussions have taken place with the different interests involved.  I wish to avoid a structure of supervision which would lead to investment intermediaries being subject to several supervisory authorities with possibly conflicting procedures.  It is also necessary to avoid very costly burdens on reputable companies.</P>
    <P>I envisage a system of prudential rules covering such areas as authorisation to act as an investment intermediary, handling of clients' funds, provision of information to clients and regulations concerning the keeping of accounts.  I recognise that some form of compensation for investors who suffer loss through the insolvency of an investment firm has to be part of that system.  In the meantime, the public should think carefully before investing with persons promising spectacular returns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First, would the Minister agree that some of the investment advice on collection of savings recently has been absolutely outrageous? Vulnerable people were &ldquo;ripped off&rdquo; of their life savings by practices which were tantamount to fraud. Second, is the Minister now saying that the Department of Finance and he himself are taking responsibility for improving and regularising the position rather than any other Department?  Third, <Col N="1388" /> would he inform the House when he thinks the amended regulations will be laid before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to agree with the sentiments implicit in the Deputy's first question, in that some outrageous things have happened.  I do not believe that position can be allowed to continue.  I must be honest and say that within days of assuming this office, when Deputy Hogan outlined the matter to me, I was not familiar with it.  However, I read about it on that occasion and have since studied the matter.  There is no protection for the public outside the insurance or stockbroking area; the few cases that arose highlighted that matter. I am not talking about people who take investment decisions to endeavour to make large profits.  I am talking about people who genuinely set out to invest their moneys wisely.  Since then I have contacted the Department of Industry and Commerce and asked them to make up their minds in order to ascertain whether they will operate within the insurance regulatory system.  If not &mdash; and this may answer the Deputy's second question &mdash; the Department of Finance will have to undertake it.  To answer the Deputy's third question, a regulatory system is required as soon as possible because the present position is totally unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's file probably will show him that I raised this matter before, following the collapse of one fund to which Deputy Noonan referred and which was recently the subject of an extensive article in one of our Sunday newspapers.  Would he agree that, following the deregulation of the provision of financial services presided over by his Department, there is clear, immediate responsibility on them to have the regulations governing insurance brokers, who now trade in the broad range of financial product services, bonded?  This apparent shuffling between his Department and the Department of Industry and Commerce is really an evasion of the responsibility incumbent on <Col N="1389" /> his Department following deregulation. In the absence of immediate action would the Minister not do what his predecessor failed to do, that is take space in the national newspapers and financial journals to clearly advise and warn people not to place their savings with unbonded brokers, be they insurance brokers or others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made some moves in that regard already.  I acknowledge the suggestion in the latter part of the Deputy's question and will have recourse to public statements myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor gave that undertaking but the advertisements did not appear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say &mdash; and Deputy Noonan made this point &mdash; that it is a much wider area than that to which Deputy Quinn referred?  On examination it transpires that there is no mandatory insurance scheme, bonding arrangements or other fund to compensate investors who may lose money.  More importantly, there are no qualifications required of people involved in this area and no regulatory agency.  I accept what the Deputy says and I will investigate the matter quickly because a regulatory agency is required.  There is no point in talking about compensation or any other provision until such an agency is established. I will take action on the last point the Deputy raised.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 20, 26, 28, 32 and 74 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, there is little I can add to the comprehensive reply of my colleague, the Minister for Energy, to parliamentary questions on this topic on 20 November 1991.  The up-to-date position is that the Commission's proposals for a carbon-energy tax, which is only one element of wider proposals to stabilise, by the year 2000, carbon dioxide emissions in the EC at the 1990 level, have been discussed by the EC Economic Policy Committee and by a special fiscal aspects group set up under the ECOFIN Council.  A progress report will be made to the ECOFIN Council itself next week.  The Commission's proposals generally will also be <Col N="1391" /> discussed in the Joint Energy-Environment Council tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The Commission's communication envisages that the carbon-energy tax would apply to all fuels and also to large-scale hydroelectric generating plants; the precise treatment of nuclear energy within the scope of the proposed tax is not entirely clear.  The intention is that industrial sectors using energy intensive production processes and engaged in international trade would be exempt, at least for a transitional period.</P>
    <P>The Commission envisages that the tax would be a 50:50 carbon-energy tax; the rate would be the equivalent of US $3 per barrel of oil in 1993, rising by one US$ per barrel a year until 2000, when the rate would be US $10 per barrel. For the EC as a whole, the Commission estimate that the yield from such a tax is likely to be 50 billion ECU.  No comparable figure is available for the yield from this tax if it applied in Ireland. However, it must be remembered that a crucial element in the Commission's proposals is that the tax should be revenue neutral, although precisely how this would be achieved has not been spelled out.</P>
    <P>At present, there is simply insufficient detail about the potential economic, and wider, impact of the Commission's proposal. The information which has been provided is vague and appears to underplay what could prove to be significant adverse repercussions on inflation and growth in the Community, as well as on national budgets.  More work is needed to ensure that the overall economic costs of any Community strategy would be reasonable and that the costs would be shared out in a way which would be consistent with the Community's obligations in the area of cohesion.  We also need to know what are the implications of the proposal for the excise harmonisation agreements being developed in the context of the Single Market.  I should add that the Irish reservations on these matters are shared by a number of member states.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> Our approach to discussions will continue to reflect the need for a thorough evaluation of all aspects of the proposal before any definitive decisions are taken on whether or not to proceed with the tax.  We have no intention of being stampeded into a hastily and ill-considered decision in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would the Minister agree that a tax such as this on carbon fuels used in the generation of electricity would bias electricity production in favour of nuclear energy? Would the Minister say whether the Government have a view on that?  Have the Government costed in any way the extra disadvantage arising from our peripherality which would argue if carbon-based fuels were loaded in the manner suggested by the Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Government would be very concerned about how it would affect our overall energy policy.  I do not think we would consider the concept of moving to nuclear generation.  In the initial approach to this matter the Government, and the Minister for Energy in particular made it very clear in this House on 20 November, that there would have to be exemptions one way or the other in so far as such would affect the ESB, or any other industry incurring large energy input costs.  The ESRI have done some research on what the tax would bring in but not on the economic downturn which it would create.  It would have horrendous effects on the economy. There is a number of other aspects.  The report on Community strategy to limit carbon dioxide emissions and to improve energy efficiency has many good elements in regard to convincing people to move from industries and implements which have high emissions.  The Government will have a neutral view at the outset.  Tomorrow the Government's views will be outlined by the Minister for Energy.  I will be doing the same on Monday at ECOFIN.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Within ECOFIN and the Council of Ministers <Col N="1393" /> has the issue of excise on fuels been taken out of the harmonisation talks or are the talks on tax harmonisation continuing with the fuel component in the discussion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That issue has to be resolved.  As far as ECOFIN Ministers are concerned, the fuel element will have to be considered within the overall harmonisation costs.  The fiscal committee are looking at it separately.  That committee and another committee are reporting back to ECOFIN on Monday and I hope the matter will be taken within the overall harmonisation of taxes.</P>

      <P>The Minister is no doubt aware of the initial reaction of the Minister for Energy, who is very unenamoured of the energy tax.  Is this Government policy?  Does the Minister feel that we should be very cautious about introducing an energy tax?  I hope he will agree that an energy tax would be immensely beneficial in that it would encourage less energy-intensive industry and perhaps help to reduce our high level of unemployment.</P>

I am not sure I could agree with the Deputy's second conclusion that a high energy tax, yielding perhaps £750 million, would be beneficial to employment, particularly as most of our firms who would be affected are labour-intensive industries.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are enough assumptions in the text of the question to allow any civil servant not engaged in nit picking to come up with an answer.  What is the Minister's view of the necessary assumptions which should be underpinning the economy to have a debt-GNP ratio of 60 per cent by the time a single currency comes in, somewhere between 1996 and 1999?</P>

      <P>In fairness to the people who were working on it, there are a lot of assumptions.  On reading the file I discovered that the Deputy had made a previous attempt to extract this information. A question was tabled in the name of Deputy Taylor-Quinn.  There is a number of aspects to be taken into account.  During the discussions last week I was conscious of when we might get to Stage 3 of European Monetary Union, whether it be in 1996 or 1999.  Examinations carried out within the Department are based on different assumptions and I do not agree totally with any of them.  I argued in the discussions last week that to get to 60 per cent at the start of Stage 3 would be difficult in the context of the arithmetic of any of the assumptions on the table.</P>

The assumptions are very clear &mdash; a balanced budget in 1993, no real increases in expenditure and an average of 3 per cent growth in <Col N="1395" /> GNP from 1992.  That fed into the system must give a time output.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The use of the expressions &ldquo;real terms&rdquo; and &ldquo;real growth&rdquo; allows for the inflation factor.  I put it to the Minister that a balanced budget in 1993 and no increase in expenditure in real terms subsequently gives the base figure for the national debt and that a real growth rate of 3 per cent on average makes certain assumptions about interest rates.  The only assumption which I have not included is the Government policy on the sale of State assets.  That assumption can affect the magnitude of the debt.  Is that not the reason the Minister is dodging the question?  He does not want to give a categoric statement on the sale of the century which has to occur for the debt-GNP ratio to come anywhere near 60 per cent by 1996-7.</P>

    <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service, Office of Public Works, in a joint arrangement with the Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland, is having a scientific assessment carried out at present in order to establish and map the sites which would be most appropriate for designation under Article 4 of the Directive throughout the entire island.  The assessment should be completed by mid-1992 and arrangements can then be made to proceed with designation commensurate with resources.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be interested to hear that a list of 110 important bird areas in Ireland was supplied to the EC Commission in 1988 on the basis of the best information available at that time.  That was a candidate list of potential special protected areas.  It was not a finite list as survey work had not been completed at that time.  Until the work <Col N="1399" /> was completed and the results analysed there existed a possibility of some sites being taken off the list and others being put on it.  The joint project with the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland will undoubtedly provide a sound basis for future designation. Some areas may be taken off the list and other areas may be put on the list.

      <P>I want to point out to the Minister that the second species of bird referred to in the question, the chough, is being stoned to death.  What worries me about the Minister's answer is that he referred to specific habitats and areas while what is really needed is the more widespread proliferation of birds such as the corncrake so that people will not have to travel to other counties to hear this bird.  I understand that these birds can only be heard at present in parts of north County Donegal and perhaps remote parts of County Mayo.  Can the Minister devise a scheme whereby these rare birds can be brought back into prominence on a nationwide basis and not just in specific reserves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Unusually enough, the position is that the designation of a site as such would not be of assistance to the corncrake.  Its survival is dependent on farming practices &mdash; for example, meadowing, etc.  However, it is known that the Irish Wildbird Conservancy have launched a campaign to raise funds for the purchase of land important for this species in the Shannon callows, one of the five key areas for corncrakes.  They are doing this in the hope of getting 50 per cent funding from the European Community.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department have agreed to a request from the Irish Wildbird Conservancy to assist in a nest finding exercise in the Moy catchment in <Col N="1400" /> County Mayo, which again is an important habitat for the species.</P>

Can the Minister say if there is any liaison between his Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food &mdash; I understand they are the Department who will administer the scheme if it is ever properly applied in this country &mdash; in regard to this issue?

      <P>I can sympathise fully with the Deputy's concern that Clonmel was not included in the extended programme but I would like to point out that selection of centres for decentralisation is a most difficult task given the large number of locations that merit consideration.  It is unfortunate that many communities and towns have had to be disappointed to date.</P>
      <P>The offer of Tipperary South Riding County Council of their premises at Irishtown, Clonmel, was brought to my attention in November last.  However the present position is that pending a review, following the successful completion of the existing programme, it would be premature to expand the present programme further at this point.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the Minister's words of sympathy, the people of south Tipperary would be happier if a commitment was given to make Clonmel a priority in the future.  May I ask the Minister why south Tipperary has been ignored to date in the context of decentralisation? Second, I should point out that South Tipperary County Council <Col N="1402" /> offered a premises to his Department for the purpose of decentralisation and that decision was arrived at unanimously at the council meeting.  The recent preliminary report of the census of population showed a disturbing decline in the population in south Tipperary.  More important the Minister should recognise that Clonmel has experienced the closure of Digital with the loss of over 200 jobs, the closure of Burkes and the rationalisation in Barlows.  In view of those facts is the Minister prepared to commit himself to having Clonmel, or some centre in south Tipperary, nominated as a priority area for decentralisation in future plans?</P>

      <P>I accept that my sympathy will not help Clonmel and I did not express it in any frivolous way.  I accept the difficulties experienced by the Deputy.  I was honoured to be in attendance at a council meeting some months ago to discuss the question of redundancies. I would be less than credible to Deputy T. Ahearn were I to say I could do much about the situation in the short term.  Phase I of the decentralisation programme is more or less finished; part one of phase II, has been successfully completed and some work is taking place on part two.  The extended programme announced in June has many aspects. Discussions are taking place with a number of Departments concerning a move to different centres.  Some are having great difficulty as I have learned from reading the files.  If I were to make further commitments, pending commitments being honoured at these eight locations, it would lack credibility.  I am sure the Deputy would not wish me to do that.  I assure the Deputy that Clonmel will join a list in the Department but I am not sure how long the list is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On the issue of decentralisation I am always surprised &mdash; and even more so when I read the files &mdash; that, as soon as the Government make decisions and the Department of Finance try to organise discussions there is not the same interest in moving.  I had better stay with the Government decisions at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1991 an administrative budget arrangement which had operated on an experimental basis in a few Departments was extended to virtually all Departments and offices.  Under this arrangement, the allocation of resources, provided in the administrative budget, between payroll costs and other administrative expenditure is a matter for departmental decision and Departments have delegated authority to fill posts up to middle management level without seeking the specific authority of the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Filling posts above these levels &mdash; or in the limited areas of the Civil Service where the administrative budget arrangement does not operate &mdash; still requires the sanction of my Department.  That <Col N="1406" /> sanction will be forthcoming in any particular instance only where my Department are convinced that the filling of a post is essential to the effective operation of a Department or service and where its filling can be accommodated within the constraints of a difficult budgetary situation. I would expect Departments, in utilising the authority delegated to them under their administrative budgets, to adopt the same criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Minister agree that the question of public service pay is a major fiscal concern for the Government?  Will he further agree that in attempting to control public sector pay he will have to look at the numbers in the public service as well as the amount each public servant is paid?  Arising from that can he state what is the Government's policy on numbers in the Civil Service and in the wider public service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The administrative budget arrangement, as the Deputy is aware, was changed in the period 1981-85.  In the areas where an administrative budget is operated decisions are left to the manager concerned, normally the Secretary of the Department.  The Houses of the Oireachtas, and some other Departments, do not operate that arrangement.  The embargo still applies in the other areas where it is based on the administrative budget arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> May I pursue the matter a little further?  Is the Minister informing the House there is no control over public service numbers up to middle management level and that that is a matter for individual Departments subject to the amount of money available? Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is left to Departments who operate the administrative budget arrangement and do not require Department of Finance sanction up to middle management, to control public service numbers.  That means that departmental managers, the supervisor, the Secretary <Col N="1407" /> of the Department or whoever is concerned, can decide whether to increase or to reduce the number of staff.  It is a far better and tighter system.  Having operated this system in the Department for the past few years, I can see that it is a far better arrangement.  It does not extend to all Departments.  The system gives flexibility and management control to a Department.  When they are implementing legislation, a new scheme, or a new idea they will have to decide then how to manage it.  This system gives the Department far more control than the arbitrary three in one system under which one post was filled when the third post had gone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Minister agree that the benefits which derive from a rather expensive redundancy package, which cost about £120 million, are now being dissipated by this new system of control in the public service? Would the Minister not further agree that it is usually in the interests of middle managers and departmental secretaries to take on more staff rather than to let staff go?  Would the Minister tell the House whether there is any procedure in place operated by his Department and by him whereby a fixed staff complement which cannot be exceeded is established for Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A fixed complement is there for the areas excluded from the administrative budget system.  The staff complement is also kept under control by the Department of Finance, who are involved in all discussions on Estimates. Examination of staffing complements is part of the yearly review, but there is flexibility on it now.  The Deputy wanted to know where the administrative budget system is not operated and whether the embargo is still effectively employed.  I would mention the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Courts, the President's Establishment, the Attorney General and related offices, charitable donations and bequests and the Garda Complaints Board.  Fixed complements of staff are <Col N="1408" /> there, but where the Department are allowed to operate the administrative budget system the complements can be increased provided the Department can show the savings on the other side.</P>
      <P>I take issue with the Deputy in that the view of most departmental heads is to try to control the staff numbers.  At times legislation has been passed in this House setting up a new Department or regulatory mechanism without providing any staffing costs.  Under the present system, if money can be saved within the Department, the Department can transfer that money at no cost to the State in order to get far more efficiency.  In my experience in the industrial relations area I know that departmental managers have operated this system very effectively.  I have to give credit for this to some of Deputy Noonan's colleagues because it was his party in government who started this concept, which works extremely well.</P>
      <P>With regard to the money borrowed from the Central Bank, a directive was issued to all Departments directing that where posts were frozen on the basis of retirement those posts could not be filled. The Department of Finance have a list clearly stating the complements and the posts that were frozen in each Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 16, 22, 27, 40, 47, 48, 63, 64, 65, 75, 84, 90, 93 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>The basic thrust of the argument contained in the report to which the Deputies refer was that Economic and Monetary Union will be detrimental to employment and income in the peripheral countries of the Community because those countries will be more prone than others to region-specific shocks and will not be able to devalue their currency to counter those shocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to address in turn the two main elements of this argument.  We are conscious of the potential problems which Economic and Monetary Union may pose for peripheral countries.  It was for that reason that, shortly after the negotiations on Economic and Monetary Union started, we submitted a series of amendments to the Treaty which were designed to cater for the situation of the less developed regions.  I am pleased to note that the framework for future Community action on cohesion which we proposed then has now been incorporated in the revised Treaty text agreed this week in Maastricht.  I am confident that this framework, along with the very specific political commitments contained in the Protocol to the Treaty to further immediate action to promote cohesion, notably through the Structural Funds, a new <Col N="1413" /> Cohesion Fund and a revised system of contributions to the Community budget, will provide sufficient protection to less developed regions.  Moreover, the framework which has been adopted will enable the Community's actions in favour of cohesion to be developed in parallel with the increasing integration of the Community.</P>
    <P>In this context I would also remind Deputies that the revised Treaty contains a provision for granting financial assistance to member states which are in difficulty or are seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond their control.</P>
    <P>In sum, therefore, I am satisfied that we have enough protection against shocks.  I would like to add, however, that, while we need to be aware of the potential problems which Economic and Monetary Union could confront us with, we should not underestimate the very tangible benefits which we are well placed to capitalise upon.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat surprised that Deputies appear to set much store by the devaluation weapon.  For the past number of years Ireland has pursued an exchange rate policy that has maintained a strong position for the Irish pound in the EMS. This has had considerable economic benefit for Ireland.  It has helped reduce inflation and to bring down interest rates. Any devaluation of the Irish pound would threaten those gains.  In addition, as an open economy, Ireland has to import much of its raw materials and energy needs.  Any policy of devaluation would automatically increase domestic costs and, as research has shown, would have little long term benefit to the real economy.</P>
    <P>As regards the supervisory role of our Central Bank, the draft Treaty on Economic and Monetary Union, in itself, will not alter the existing position.  Article 105 (5) of the draft Treaty indicates that the European System of Central Banks shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system.  This is a legitimate role <Col N="1414" /> of advising and assisting national supervisory institutions in a Community context.</P>
    <P>However, the draft Treaty, at Article 108 (4), also enables the Council to confer specific tasks concerning policies relating to prudential supervision of credit institutions and other financial institutions except insurance companies. No parameters are laid down in the draft Treaty for the remit of these specific tasks but it seems sensible to allow for the possibility that the ECB might be given a future role in relation to the policy of prudential supervision if, for example, action at Community level were required or if the stability of the financial markets in the Community was involved.  I would add that any such role would have to be approved unanimously by Council.  This is a safeguard against any untoward action in this area.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Government's attitude to the concept of a European Central Bank, our views are well known on this subject and do not require much elaboration on this occasion.  The Government are fully committed to the establishment of a European Central Bank, which will have as its primary objective the maintenance of price stability and, without prejudice to this, will also have as an objective to support the general economic policies in the Community.</P>
    <P>I do not see any conflict between Ireland's national interest and an independent European Central Bank established to manage a single currency and monetary policy throughout the Community. Our national interest can best be served through the pooling of sovereignty which is involved in the creation of such an institution.  Through the involvement of our own Central Bank in the ECB, Ireland will be assured of an enhanced role in determining the monetary policy of the Community.  This will be a signficant improvement from the present position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EMS where we are committed to maintaining the value of the Irish pound against other EMS currencies but we have no direct say in the <Col N="1415" /> formulation of the monetary policy for those currencies.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> With 102 questions down today, the new Minister has had a crash course on the various issues, having regard to the length of the replies that are coming.</P>
      <P>In circumstances where there is such little play now in exchange rate policy as an instrument of economic policy, have the Government considered tying the Irish Punt directly to the Mark and taking the advantage on reduced interest rates rather than continuing with a pretence that there is play in exchange rate policy as an instrument of economic management?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been looked at.  There is a view that the policy of tying the Punt directly to the Deutsche Mark will not be successful.  The Belgians have tried to operate it and it has not been beneficial.  Our previous experience indicates that it would not be very beneficial. The view of the Central Bank and the Department is that it would not bring the benefits it might seem to on the surface but might have a totally different effect.  An alternative policy which has been pursued now for a number of years is to cut the linkages as far as possible. We are now at 1 per cent where we were at 9 per cent a few years ago.  We must aim to keep that policy tight.  In ten days of discussions over the last three weeks we had an opportunity to hear the German Government's views and those of a number of senior Ministers who attended those discussions as to how they see the Bundesbank operating.</P>
      <P>Not just in the immediate future, but for the next ten years we must continue to maintain a very small divergence between ourselves and them on the exchange market.  If we allow the gap to open up again it would be horrendous for our economy.  If we stay where we are with that small variation we will remain in a stronger position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is that if we did that there could be a considerable outflow of German money. There is an advantage for German institutions who invest in Irish gilts which is now substantial, and they might pull out if there was no differential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect to this.  The fact that the money is in the economy keeps interest rates strong from our monetary position.  We have to consider what would happen after we have one monetary policy.  Then perhaps the same arguments in regard to inflows and outflows would not apply.  In the short term it would be dangerous because on balance keeping the money in is better from our point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Development Corporation was conceived in political conflict, strangled at birth by financial deprivation and constrained, for <Col N="1471" /> the duration of its existence, by the absence of political will to make it work. It is important to record that the political will never existed to make the concept of a National Development Corporation in this country work.  The concept of a State venture capital company with the developmental role in industrial strategy was effectively strangled at birth.  It was announced in 1981 by the then Tánaiste, but the warring factors in that Coalition cabinet did not manage to introduce the legislation until 1985 and did not complete it until 1986.  Since then it has been starved of the necessary funds.  From 1986 to date NADCORP has invested approximately £26 million and currently holds shares in about 57 companies which employ in total almost 2,000 people.</P>
      <P>Some people have taken that up during the course of the debate as meaning that the National Development Corporation have created 2,000 jobs.  I would like the Minister to specifically address that point in his reply.  That is not my understanding of it.  I do not understand the Minister to be saying that the equity invested in these 57 companies has created 2,000 jobs.  It has assisted, presumably, in making the enterprises in question viable or keeping them viable and generating additional employment, etc., but it has not created 2,000 jobs and I think that point should be clarified if I am wrong, because other speakers are saying that it did quite well to create 2,000 jobs.  It did not create 2,000 jobs as I understand it, and more is the pity.</P>
      <P>That, I suggest, is a puny involvement in the context of the scale.  For example, in 1990 NADCORP invested £5.3 million and only £3.1 million in 1989.  Compare that with the new limit being introduced in the Bill today of £1,200 million for the IDA to assist them with their mandate of grant aiding and otherwise assisting industry.  Clearly NADCORP were never taken seriously and a good idea was never really tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister has concluded that the private venture capital market has developed greatly since 1986, making NADCORP'S role redundant.  I am <Col N="1472" /> advised by business people that the private sector venture capital companies, or risk capital companies as they are sometimes called, are in fact misnomers. These companies are disinterested in meeting strategic industrial objectives or in assisting the development of any enterprise which cannot virtually guarantee a quick return on money's invested.  If the purpose of a national development corporation is, to quote the then Minister for Energy when introducing the Bill in 1986, &ldquo;to play a critical role in the Government's overall strategy for the development of the indigenous resource sector of the economy, especially in relation to agriculture, fisheries and forestry, it is by no means evident to me that private venture capital will meet that challenge.</P>
    <P>In helping to construct such an indigenous sector for the first time in the Irish economy, quick returns on investment may not always be possible.  Consequently, the dictates of the private venture sector are allowed to determine critical investment decisions.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note in this regard that, according to the findings of the survey of business attitudes contained in the review of industrial performance last year, 61 per cent of those surveyed considered State venture capital to be an important support mechanism of industrial development.  I am not arguing for imprudent investment decisions by a State agency or that such an agency should apply criteria which are less rigorous than those applied in the private sector, but I am arguing that targeting investment is a major instrument of industrial policy and that the existence of a body, such as NADCORP were intended to be, enables the State to intervene to meet critical policy objectives. That same review pointed out that &ldquo;there is a poor correlation between public expenditure on industry and net employment creation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Instead of doling out, annually, massive expenditure in grant aid, supports and tax reliefs of various kinds, The Workers' Party have argued that the State should <Col N="1473" /> take direct shareholdings in the enterprises being assisted.  In so far as this Bill permits the IDA to hold such preference shares I welcome this development. However, this decision alone will not revolutionise our industrial strategy, especially if the extent of its implementation is constrained in the same fashion as were the operations of NADCORP.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say that he, too, accepts the argument that we have not been getting value for money from the system we have been operating up to now where up to £1 billion a year is doled out by way of grant aid to industry or, as the report put it, there is a poor correlation between State expenditure on industry and net employment creation, but the question is, what changes does he propose to make in industrial policy?</P>
    <P>Other speakers have taken great exception to the manner in which the Bill which deals with such a major issue has been rushed before the House, without any agreement.  Ideally, in discussing such a Bill we should discuss the inherent failures in industrial policy rather than focus attention on the minimalist measures contained in the Bill.  The House, within the lifetime of this Dáil has not been provided with an opportunity to discuss industrial policy.  That is extremely regrettable having regard to the fact there appears to be agreement on all sides of the House that our existing industrial strategy is manifestly not working, that there are almost 300,000 people unemployed and that we have witnessed highest rates of emigration during the past four or five years since the low point of the mid-fifties.  As I said in the House before, if we are to make any impact on the question of employment generation, industrial policy ought to be the subject matter of a sustained debate in this House.</P>
    <P>We have had enough reports which analyse our industrial performance.  The Department produced their own recent reports.  In his speech, if my memory serves me correctly, the Minister warned that we should not seize this opportunity to confuse it with the review of industrial policy which is currently being concluded <Col N="1474" /> by the special review group which he set up.  I do not see any reason we ought not confuse it given that they all deal with the same problem.  Time after time, in the lifetime of this Dáil, we have been asked to discuss some aspect of industrial policy.  We are proceeding in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion to make piecemeal reforms without making any overall assessment of the defects in industrial policy and the changes we ought to make.  This is regrettable. These reforms include the rationalisation of agencies, the extension of the special manufacturing tax regime to the year 2010 and a number of others.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised he will act swiftly on the review which will be completed by the end of the year, but I cannot see in the middle of the crisis we face at present in terms of unemployment, the reason we cannot have this debate on industrial policy and make a number of changes, if the House agrees and the Government so determine.  Instead, we are being asked to rush through this legislation which will abolish the only State venture capital company.</P>
    <P>The argument the Minister has put forward is that the private venture capital sector has developed greatly since 1986 and there is no need for this agency.  I have been dealing with business people long enough to know that that is not the way they perceive it.  If one goes with a good idea to any of the risk capital companies, they will have to be given assurances with the result that by the time they divvy up the project will have to be risk-free.  There is agreement in the House that one of the major defects in our industrial performance has been our inability to construct an indigenous sector in the economy.  If we are to set ourselves broad policy goals and objectives the State must reserve to itself the right to intervene and target spending of scarce resources.  It could do this through a State development agency such as NADCORP. That was the original thinking.</P>
    <P>The impact by NADCORP has been so puny that I cannot get hot under the collar about the decision to rationalise them in this fashion.  They were neither given the necessary resources nor <Col N="1475" /> encouraged.  The political will was never there, they operated in a hostile culture and the impact they had was minimal.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the board set out in his statement in their final report that they had played a minimalist role.  In 1990, £5.3 million was invested and £3.1 million was invested the previous year.</P>
    <P>The chairman wrote the type of report that chairman of semi-State boards write. The one exception was Mr. Alex Spain of the B &amp; I, but his report was not allowed see the light of day.  Chairmen of companies are very careful to conform to the pleasant language that will not incur the wrath of the Minister and nobody would wish to incur the wrath of this Minister.  I gather that when he is in full flight he is a sight to behold.  Nonetheless, Mr. Richard Burrows drew attention to the fact in his statement, in relation to the survey of business attention to which I have referred, that 61 per cent of those surveyed considered State venture capital to be an important support mechanism of industrial development.  In throwing one of those bones to the Minister so as to be seen to be in tune with him Richard Burrows says that private sector venture has become more readily available through BES funds and the easing of bank credit.  That statement is already out of date on both counts.  The BES was quite properly cut back in the last Finance Bill and hopefully additional loopholes will be plugged in the next Finance Bill because that scheme was disgracefully abused in some cases.  Mr. Burrows, as chairman, seems to be offering that as an excuse as to why we do not need NADCORP.  The existence of the BES and the easing of bank credit were very temporary palliatives indeed.  It seems it is not difficult to envisage a whole series of enterprises that might profitably, usefully and productively, in terms of employment, avail of the existence of such a body as NADCORP.  The Minister commented on remarks he made at the recent launch of a promotional video, a video that seems to have had a short shelf life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The body to which it refers has been abolished.  I would like to have had the opportunity of viewing the video.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce does not seem to take the same approach as, for example, the former Minister for Labour, who ensured that spokepersons on this side of the House were formally invited to meet the chairperson and chief executives of State companies such as AnCO, FAS and other agencies under his aegis.  Seeing that we cannot have the assistance of high calibre public servants like Mr. Purcell, I think it would be useful if we were at least facilitated with meetings with organisations such as NADCORP which the Minister should be able to concede without political conflict.  I would like to know how the Minister can conclude that these developments in the private venture capital market make this body redundant.</P>
      <P>I assume the Minister will say that the IDA will take over that role.  I am not opposed in principle to the rationalisation of agencies, and effect has already been given to some rationalisation in the area of industrial promotion because it seems there has been overlapping and presumably costs have been incurred as a result of that overlapping. Therefore there is an argument for rationalisation of the agencies.</P>
      <P>I do not want to provoke Deputy Carey, and I am not suggesting that, for example, SFADCo should be rationalised, but it is interesting that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is as prone as the rest of us to looking after his back garden.  Noises were made when the Progressive Democrats were in full ideological flight that the IDA were doing the job adequately and that whereas there was a role for Gaeltarra éireann or údarás na Gaeltachta, there was no necessity for that aspect of SFADCO's mandate.  That was the Progressive Democrats argument, but I do not think that company will be interfered with in the rationalisation that is being presaged by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred today to the fact <Col N="1477" /> that the limit currently imposed on the IDA is rapidly being exhausted.  I would be obliged if the Minister would do some research for me on that.  I do not know how the £688 million compares to the amount dispensed by the IDA in the last few years.  Am I to presume that that involves not just direct grant aid but also equity participation by the IDA in some companies?  I repeat that on the scale of the new limit of £1,200 million the investment absorbed by NADCORP in recent years has been minimalist.</P>
    <P>The Minister cautioned us that &ldquo;Deputies should not confuse this Bill with any measures which the review group may recommend as I propose to deal with these swiftly at a later stage&rdquo;. That is an unfair attempt to warn us off the wider debate.  For the reasons I have outlined, all those measures that we have been discussing on a piecemeal basis up to and including today are essentially parts of the ingredients that would go towards a revamp of industrial policy. We may be taking decisions that will cut across recommendations of, for example, the industrial review group and we may have to change some of these decisions again.  It is regrettable that on such a critical issue as industrial policy we should proceed on that basis.</P>
    <P>I want to comment very briefly on the impact of unemployment on the Dublin region.  Deputy Taylor and Deputy Barry dealt with the overall endemic unemployment crisis as we all sadly know it, but there has been a perception abroad for the years of our greatest industrial expansion that Dublin has been doing exceptionally well as compared with the other regions.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  There is a crisis in Dublin, a crisis in pure statistical terms that is worse than anything else we have to contend with.  For example, when jobs were being lost at a great speed in the eighties Dublin lost most of them, and in the seventies when jobs were being created the fewest went to Dublin.  In the seventies there was a net increase of 33,000 jobs in Ireland but yet Dublin, the largest, most populous and most industrialised part of the country, got just 3 per cent of these <Col N="1478" /> jobs.  When Government policies led to the loss of a staggering 42,000 jobs between 1981 and 1989 a massive 64 per cent, or 26,595 jobs, were lost in the capital.  The fact that Dublin got so few new jobs in the seventies and had to bear almost two-thirds of all job losses in the eighties provides strong evidence of a policy of deliberate discrimination which must now be reversed.  I do not think it has impinged on the public consciousness that the position in Dublin is so appallingly bad.  I represent a constituency that is not untypical of a number of Dublin constituencies where, in large tracts of them, the unemployment rate is up to 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>One can talk about minimal progressive improvements in budgetary policy in terms of social welfare entitlements, but that will have no impact on these communities until we tackle the crisis in unemployment.  I will refer to a recent article published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 15 November 1991 on a study done by Dr. P.J. Drudy and Ms. Orla McKeown on the question of job losses in manufacturing.  Their conclusions are similar to those in other reports.  Having talked about the overall situation and the decline in manufacturing in the Dublin region, the article goes on to say:</P>
    <P>More alarming, however, is the fact that the growth in the number of firms did not in fact result in any net increase in employment.  The opposite occurred.  The net loss in employment in Irish owned firms in Dublin during the 1970s was 3,800 &mdash; and this was at a time when every other region in the State was experiencing significant employment growth.  During the same period, foreign owned firms increased their employment in Dublin by only 230; this was again in sharp contrast to what was happening in other areas.</P>
    <P>During most of the 1980s, the situation was even more serious.  By 1989, Dublin had reached a low point.  In that year there were almost 25,000 fewer jobs in manufacturing industry than there had been in 1980.  The vast majority of these losses were suffered <Col N="1479" /> by Irish-owned firms so that the proportionate importance of foreign-generated employment has increased from 33 per cent to 40 per cent of the total during the decade.  During 1990 there were overall net gains of 500 manufacturing jobs in Dublin, but whether this signals a serious revival remains to be seen.  A dramatic turnaround would be required to counteract the losses of the past decade.</P>
    <P>I presume that will also interest you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in your capacity as a Deputy for Dublin NorthWest. This is an appalling picture of the extent of the crisis in Dublin.  I look forward to the House being given the opportunity to consider what the Minister says will be his swift reaction to the recommendations of the Industrial Review Group when they will draw their conclusions at the end of this year.  I sincerely hope this will not become caught up in the log jam, as did the second triennial report on industrial performance.  It took a great deal longer for that report to see the light of day, for some reason that one is left to guess at, than should have been the case.  We have enough reports.  The sad thing is that too many of the reports compiled in the past decade were not significantly acted upon.  This Minister will say that he has made some reforms &mdash; and he has &mdash; but the unemployment situation is worsening and I look forward to the opportunity of having a comprehensive debate on industrial policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill sets out to do a clearly defined job: first and foremost it winds up NADCORP; second, it transfers its assets and responsibilities to the IDA; and, third, it increases the upper limit of the aggregate grants of the IDA and SFADCo, which will allow them to continue supporting industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill steers away from policy and I too, like the last speaker, am anxiously looking forward to the speedy action, which I am sure the Minister will take, as he promised, when the report of the <Col N="1480" /> review group comes to hand.  Clearly, the introduction of this Bill is both timely and necessary.  The IDA and SFADCo were about to reach the upper limit of the amount of grants that both bodies were empowered to make to industry. Clearly, from what the Minister had to say in his speech, NADCORP had outlived its usefullness and was doing nothing which the IDA &mdash; given such powers by this Bill &mdash; cannot undertake. It is important that both the IDA and SFADCo are given the wherewithal to pursue their efforts to attract further industrial development and investment to this country.  The increase in the upper limits to £1,200 million and £150 million respectively for the IDA and SFADCo are appropriate.</P>
    <P>Despite the adverse criticism, I believe the IDA have done a very good job down through the years.  They have succeeded in attracting very significant and worthwhile foreign investment.  A very significant percentage of the working population are employed in foreign firms which the IDA attracted to this country. They were encouraged to set up business because of the grants they were offered. Despite the criticism to the contrary, I believe it was a worthwhile exercise and I do not subscribe to the idea that the IDA were throwing money at foreigners who would avail of all the grants and incentives before clearing out.  Unfortunately, that might have happened in isolated incidents.  However, the whole pattern of their activities over the years proves that it was well worthwhile both economically and industrially to this country.  By and large, they have done a good job.  The IDA and their personnel encouraged industries, which would not otherwise have done so to set up in the small towns throughout the country.  Fortunately, many of those smaller industries in the small towns are still extant and flourishing.</P>
    <P>The economic climate has changed a great deal in recent years, not just nationally but internationally, and it is now more difficult to attract industries to this country, as indeed it must be for other countries.  I am quite certain that <Col N="1481" /> other countries face the same limitations and similar problems in preserving and extending the opportunities for employment. Similarly, SFADCo have done a good job.  Again, I hate to differ with my county man opposite, but I am sorry that we cannot have a few more bodies like SFADCo along the west coast.</P>
    <P>In years gone by when it was evident that the west and south west would find it a struggle to survive economically, SFADCo was established and since then it has done wonderful job.  It is the one bright spot in the long journey from the north of Donegal down to Kerry.  I am only sorry that a similar body cannot be set up in other parts of the west, a body that would enhance the opportunities and possibilities for those regions and would do for those regions what SFADCo has done for the mid-west.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech he referred to the Industrial Policy Review Group which he established last June and I was pleased to hear of his intention to take all appropriate action as soon as the report of that group, which is expected shortly, comes to hand.  Action is needed in view of the serious unemployment level and I am sure that the urgency of the need for such action is fully appreciated by the Minister.  I urge the Minister to lose no time and spare no effort in implementing any worthwhile suggestion in that report which would help to alleviate the unemployment level.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the transfer to the IDA of all NADCORP assets, liabilities and commitments, but it also makes amendments to the Industrial Development Act, 1986, by increasing the grant and by allowing the IDA to, first, hold shares in its own name and, second, give employment grants to all industries rather than to small industries only, as was the position heretofore.  Those two provisions are certainly steps in the right direction.  Indeed, the first provision in particular is long overdue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the extension of the employment grant to all industry, I understand that at the moment there is no differential between grants available <Col N="1482" /> to industries no matter where in the country they are set up so long as their employees number fewer than 15.  I suggest to the Minister that there should be a differential between grants offered to employers in the disadvantaged part of Ireland &mdash; the west of Ireland, if you like &mdash; and to employers in the east who avail themselves of those grants.  Years ago there was a large differential in the capital grants available to industry.  If I remember correctly, there was a 60 per cent capital grant available in the west and a 45 per cent grant available in other places.  I do not wish to be thought of as talking only about the west; I mention it in the context of the disadvantaged part of Ireland.  To my way of thinking, all of Ireland, with the exception of a few cities and big towns, is now disadvantaged.  In the provision of employment grants the west of Ireland could be extended to include other disadvantaged areas or even provincial and rural Ireland, which would include smaller towns with populations of 2,000 and 3,000.  Many of those towns are finding it difficult to survive.  It is essential to make some effort to provide industry and employment opportunities for the people who live in those areas and not just those who live in the cities.</P>
    <P>In many ways it would make good sense in the national interest to encourage development in the lesser developed parts of Ireland and to discourage it in those parts that have the greatest development now, because often at times further development merely adds to the headaches of an area of development.  It puts a burden on the existing infrastructure and builds up a problem for the future, a problem which could perhaps cost millions and millions of pounds to solve satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he consider introducing a differential between the employment grant paid to an employer in the more developed parts of Ireland &mdash; in the east &mdash; and the employment grant paid to an employer in the other parts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill generally and I look forward to the action that the Minister <Col N="1483" /> proposes to take when the review group report is to hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I first place on record my objection to the Bill being imposed on the House with very little time given to Members to consider the details of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill is sponsored by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who professes to have a major role to play in altering the proceedings of the House and making them more democratic and accessible to the general membership of the House.  By producing the Bill at such short notice, rushing it through the House and giving very little time for debate &mdash; and, in particular for discussion on Committee Stage &mdash; the Minister's actions do not sit well with his professed desire for the House to be more amenable to its ordinary membership.</P>
      <P>The first point I wish to make in this submission is that serious consideration should be given to the idea of changing the title of the Bill.  This is not the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill, since &ldquo;development&rdquo; implies improvement, progression and consolidation &mdash; a positive feature that can be measured in terms of the wellbeing of its participants. No, this is not the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill.  I submit that it should more correctly be called the &ldquo;Requiem for a Government Bill&rdquo; because it very effectively gives notice that this Government is breathing its last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are throwing in the towel and admitting that they have run out of their own ideas.  Additionally, they are seeking to kill off the ideas of others by the introduction of the Bill.  The Bill is a public admission by the Government that they have nothing left to offer the workforce of this country.  In the past the Government have conceded by covert means that their cupboard of ideas is bare; they are now attempting to sell off the cupboard itself.  When all of the fancy phrases are stripped away, when the high-flown expressions of endeavour are laid bare and when the nitty-gritty of the Bill is exposed to critical scruitiny, then <Col N="1484" /> the skeleton which is left will be seen to be nothing more and nothing less than a shameless admission by the Government that they have nothing to offer in the area of employment stimulation and small business growth &mdash; two key sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>If one goes back to 1985, the year in which the National Development Corporation Bill was enacted by the House, it will be noted that the conditions which spawned and gave birth to NADCORP &mdash; conditions of rising unemployment and lack of long term venture capital for the small firm and the cash starved entrepreneur &mdash; have not changed today. The need for NADCORP is as great as ever.  Indeed, on the basis that NADCORP should be viewed not as a single entity in isolation from the other State agencies but as an integral part of an overall strategy in our approach to the employment question, it is ridiculous to view NADCORP as anything other than an essential tool in an ongoing quest for answers to the employment problem.</P>
    <P>Conditions in the marketplace have not changed for the better; rather, they have worsened in many ways.  Energy should be channelled in the direction of bolstering the support systems.  The Bill seeks to do the opposite by removing an arm from the corporate body, leaving it weaker and less well able to function.</P>
    <P>NADCORP was set up on the basis that a particular niche in the financial support system was identified as not having been exploited or assisted by the private sector.  It was also a condition of their establishment that their role would run parallel to and in total harmony with that of the IDA.  There is no suggestion that that has not been the case in the intervening years.  Therefore, why are we now being asked to support what can only be described as two steps backwards when previously we had taken a positive step forward?</P>
    <P>The development of a venture capital market, capable of making a significant contribution to industrial expansion, is as much an educational process as anything else.  Those were the words of Deputy <Col N="1485" /> John Bruton in this House on the introduction of the National Development Corporation Bill six years ago.  I happen to agree wholeheartedly with those sentiments. The development of a venture capital market is an educational process, a learning process, one which must be measured in the long-term as part of an overall strategy.  I believe the sentiments which stimulated the introduction of that Bill are even more valid today.  If we accept the Bill before us in effect we will be preventing the embryo from maturing, not merely throwing out the baby with the bathwater but throwing away the bath itself.</P>
    <P>In considering this Bill it is important to ponder on the role of NADCORP as it was intended when the Bill for its establishment was originally introduced. The eighties brought a multitude of scientific and technological innovations which changed the face of industry and commerce. Those changes brought problems, particularly related to the use of personnel, which have added enormously to the unemployment which has bedevilled this country for years.  In such circumstances there are two ways of tackling the problem.  The first is to accept that the problem exists and resolve it by merely penalising the workforce.  The second is to endeavour to reverse the trend by offering support and assistance to those willing to chart new ground, to attempt alone what they can no longer undertake as part of a group.  That is what the National Development Corporation were established to do.  I believe their role is more vital today than ever.  If NADCORP have had a problem, their efficiency impaired or had been less than might have been required that can have been caused only by the manner in which they were hamstrung by Government through lack of adequate funding and support.  There has been no suggestion of which we are aware that NADCORP have not been functioning along the lines intended or were at variance with other State agencies.  If that is so &mdash; and there is no evidence to the contrary &mdash; why then are we discussing a Bill seeking to <Col N="1486" /> dissolve the corporation, leaving us without one more valuable aid in our endeavours to come to grips with the greatest single problem confronting the country today.  When all is said and done this is about employment, or lack thereof and, more importantly, about the lack of desire and motivation on the part of the Government to come to grips with the pernicious disease slowly strangling our nation.  Let us awaken from this awful sleep induced by the total torpor of Government inaction which sees us lumber from one nightmare to another in the wild expectation that, when we finally awaken, everything will be all right, Mother Ireland will be there to soothe us and bathe our fevered brows.  Mother Ireland is a sick old lady at present without a nurse or caretaker, now having her medicine withdrawn.</P>
    <P>We are constantly reminded by people on the other side of the House about how healthy is our economy, how well we are doing <i>vis-à-vis</i> financial targets and how soon we shall turn the corner, that is if the Government can ever discover where that corner lies.  I say to Members of the House: try telling that to the thousands in the dole queues in my constituency, there not because of any individual or collective inadequacies but rather because of the uncaring attitude of a Government so bereft of ideas they are amputating their own limbs; try talking about economic wellbeing to the young electronic engineer in my constituency who must be content with a job behind a check-out till; or to the school teacher who applies his talents in an office where he needs only to be able to write letters and answer the telephone; or to the food technician who uses his skills garnered over many years in a once-weekly deciphering of his signing-on sheet.  Try talking about a healthy economy to the many craft workers left without either a job or any hope of one by the closure of Irish Sugar in Thurles, whose futures will appear even gloomier by the closure of one more channel to their aspirations if this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Many Members of the House could tell similar stories, about a constituency <Col N="1487" /> where the once strong urban-rural divide no longer obtains because, like the walls which have crumbled all over Eastern Europe, it has crumbled under the twin onslaught of unemployment and the devastation of essential services.  The farming community in mine and many other constituencies have fared equally badly in the present economic climate.  There is sufficient evidence to confirm that much entrepreneurial potential lies simmering beneath the surface if only it could be tapped and supported by the right agencies. If we abolish those agencies &mdash; as is the proposal in this Bill with regard to NADCORP &mdash; what will be the outlook? We should seek to expand the support services on offer in the workplace rather than curtail them and channeling them through a single agency, as is now proposed. That is not intended in any way as a criticism of the IDA but rather simply pointing to the need for a proper evaluation of what these agencies are doing and the direction in which we should be looking in the difficult years lying ahead for the remainder of the nineties.</P>
    <P>On regular visits to the towns of Thurles, Nenagh and Roscrea in north Tipperary I never cease to be impressed by the huge numbers of young second-level students these towns support.  One is impressed but, at the same time, more than a little apprehensive.  For example, it is a chastening experience to be in Thurles at lunch time on a school-going day when more than 2,000 students hit the streets.  They are the life blood of our country, the vibrant future workforce and leaders.  What have we to offer them? We offer them a town and county in serious decline because of lack of Government support, where unemployment for life is a grim reality for a great many people.  For those young people opportunity is a word spoken with an American or Australian accent, for whom the height of ambition is to be able to make it across the Atlantic or to the other side of the world.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation was an excellent concept and could still be excellent in operation if only <Col N="1488" /> they were properly funded to allow them carry out their remit.  Their role should be advertised in the workplace so that the people who can reap most benefit will be made aware of their existence and what they can do for them.  If they had a failing that may well have been that their existence was not sufficiently known or their services not as widely publicised as may have been required.  If NADCORP have not been functioning properly their role should be re-evaluated and reassessed so that any inherent difficulties can be ironed out or eliminated.  We should not let them go out of existence because of a fit of Government or ministerial pique or because of some imagined slight simply because it was not the Minister's idea in the first place.</P>
    <P>We own it to our people not to remove this support system for those with ideas, talent and commitment.  We should offer them every encouragement we can rather than be seen to be acting against the interests of those who cannot otherwise compete in the punitive area of capital borrowing on the open market.  We have many talented people who have demonstrated that they can succeed given the right environment and assistance.  If we pass this Bill we shall have taken another giant step toward the further erosion of public confidence in our collective ability and the desire of this Government to tackle the evil of unemployment effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  In particular I commend the provisions of section 9 enabling the Minister to continue to assist industry because, without such assistance, we would have even fewer jobs.  I know of an industry in my home town in Sligo assisted by the IDA. Indeed many such industries have done excellent work and provided a number of jobs in an area where employment is much needed.  Our infrastructure must be improved considerably to ensure that we reap the best benefits from industrial activity, particularly in the west, where our roads network must be upgraded with this in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" /> It takes approximately four hours to travel by road from the west to the nearest large port, which is Dublin, and it is important that we have better roads for heavy vehicles making this journey.  I worked for many years in one of the great industries in the west, GWI in Collooney in County Sligo, which at one time employed over 400 people.  Business was expanding and they borrowed heavily to build a new factory.  Because of high interest rates in the eighties which were not controlled by the then Government, the company were unable to meet a number of repayments and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now Leader of the Opposition, decided to close the door on GWI.  That was one of the saddest days for Sligo and the west. The factory had been grant-aided by the IDA and by Fóir Teoranta.  If proper negotiations had taken place it would have been possible to prevent closure and to retain the reduced workforce of 120 people.  Instead, these employees, who had carpentry and machine skills, were put out of work.  If the business expansion scheme had then been in operation, it would have helped that industry.  It would have been cheaper to keep those 120 people in employment than to close the factory and sell the machinery.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme has been somewhat reduced but its availability to industry should be maintained. Basta Locks, a company located in my town of Tubbercurry and once owned by a former Member of this House, has been taken over by a group of workers who have availed of the business expansion scheme.  Unfortunately, this company are not being supported.  When one looks around this House and the new offices in Government Buildings, one sees that the ironmongery was not purchased in this country.  Our architects must be prepared to specify Irish-made products.  All the material in a recently build hospital in Sligo was imported.  How is our industry to continue if we import foreign-made goods?  These locks can be made and purchased in Tubbercurry, Country Sligo. Builders providers must stock these goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Basta locks are as good as Yale or Union locks.  Why are people not buying them?  Is it because they are considered to be of inferior quality? They may have been inferior many years ago but not today.  But for the business expansion scheme, Basta might not be as progressive as it is.  I want to ensure that this scheme is maintained in order to assist industry.</P>
      <P>A good road infrastructure is important if industry is to be attracted to the west and enabled to transport finished products to the ports.  When the big loads were leaving GWI for Cork or Dublin years ago, it was important to have a good road.  The same applies today.  The west needs special support because it is so far away from the nearest large port, Dublin.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Government on their support for industrial development. If interest rates can be kept down it will assist industries who are working on overdrafts. New industries can be set up. Years ago when people wore clogs there was a successful factory manufacturing the clogs here.  Unfortunately clogs are not generally worn nowadays but they are coming back into use in hospitals. Perhaps the Minister would encourage some enterprise to set up a clog factory. I believe people would wear them.  At one time if you wore clogs you were classed as poor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill as I believe the time is right for our industrial policy to be reviewed.  We seem to vary greatly in the emphasis we place on various aspects of industry depending on which party are in power.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that NADCORP are being put to sleep, so to speak, particularly in view of the quantum leap we need to make in terms of achieving greater industrial development and attracting more international investment.  If we do not manage to attract such investment in the very near future our industrial policy will need to be reviewed.  Indeed, I see no reason this policy cannot be reviewed now.  When one considers that we have an unemployment level of 260,000 &mdash; the highest in the EC &mdash; and that approximately 30,000 people are involved in various training schemes one can see that it is high time we took a long hard look at our industrial policy.  We need to ask ourselves where we are going, where we have gone wrong and where we want to go in terms of industrial policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that we are running fast to stay in the same spot.  We have not achieved <Col N="1492" /> anything in terms of reducing the number of people on the live register.  This is the saddest indictment of the present system. I am not making a political point to any Minister.  However, responsibility for reducing the number of people on the live register and for creating jobs rests with them.  They are the people who told us what they would do when they became Ministers.  I am sure they find their appointments as Ministers very rewarding in terms of job satisfaction, etc. However, they must be very disappointed in terms of job creation.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the industrial policy pursued by Governments for a number of years was not successful.  I am talking about the policy of attracting multinational companies into the country and giving them grants.  There was nothing wrong with that policy.  The problem was that it was never perfected and it never achieved its full potential At present approximately 80,000 people here are employed both directly and indirectly by multinational companies. If we could double this figure we would be making great strides in trying to solve our unemployment problem.  However, the prospects of doubling that figure, based on our performance over the past ten to 15 years which covers the life of a number of Governments, are very slim indeed.</P>
    <P>It was thought in the mid-eighties that the time had come for the establishment of a body which would have State and private sector involvement to fill the gap which existed in this area.  Apparently that is no longer the case and NADCORP are, so to speak, to be put down and their liabilities and assets transferred to the IDA.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves how successful the IDA have been in attracting the foreign investment we require.  A number of people believe that they have not been as successful in this area as they should be.  Those of us who have sought investment from the IDA for blighted areas know full well the frustration which can be experienced by people.  We have heard all the well known cliches such as that an area is being marketed on a <Col N="1493" /> national basis in the normal way, that it is being shown to various industrialists, etc.  The competition for investment is much tougher now than it was five years ago.  I do not know why the activities of NADCORP are being transferred to the IDA.  Will this make the IDA more incisive, more competitive, more alert, more aware and more successful or is it being done for bureaucratic or ideological reasons?  The one thing which is certain is that other people in the marketplace are competing fiercely for Japanese, US and European investment.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of months reference has been made to the need to ensure that the jam on the European cake is spread evenly.  We heard about this during the debate on Maastricht, both last week and again this morning. We will also hear about it in the run up to the referendum next year.  In the context of investment in jobs in this country we should be able to say with justification that we are getting a fair share of the investment and opportunities being made available in the European arena.  Preference should not be given to one region.  We should ask ourselves the obvious question: are we getting a fair share of investment now available in Europe?  Given our employment requirement I honestly believe that we are not getting our fair share.  People will trot out figures and say that industrial growth was X, Y or Z and compare it with growth in our European counterparts.  That is not the point.  The point is that we have the highest unemployment level in the EC, the highest requirement and have much further to go before we reach the levels being achieved in most member states.</P>
    <P>We can merge companies like the IDA and NADCORP as often as we like, trot out figures, try to convince ourselves that Government policy is achieving certain objectives and get Central Bank reviews and other reviews on a day to day basis but this will not achieve anything unless there is a massive change in policy both by the Government and the IDA.  If this is not done we will still have 265,000 people on the live register and 30,000 people involved in training courses.  This <Col N="1494" /> huge burden on our economy means that the people who need assistance are being deprived of it.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the new macho images which have emerged in recent times and the tough Government policy which would encourage new initiatives and entrepreneurships.  About a year ago competition, which is now much vaunted, in the baking industry caused considerable job losses in two bakeries in my constituency, one in Athy and the other in Kilcock.  At that time I raised questions in the House about whether the bread price war would be in the long-term interests of the consumer, the employees, etc., and whether it was being used to remove people from the marketplace and the production arena which would lead to the removal of competition. Sufficient attention is not being given to this issue at present.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the production arena was pinned down and the people who were in production, Kellys of Kilcock and Bradburys of Athy, went to the wall. Ministers came into the House and justified that.  A year later we have very little to offer those people except continued unemployment.  We can say with our hands on our hearts, from the Government side of the House, that competition was good for us.  Just how good was it? One year later the consumer, the man or woman in the street, will say prices have increased to what they were, there is less competition, there are fewer people in the production arena in that category and there are 2,000 fewer people in the baking industry than there were five or six years ago.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about job creation and investment we should look again at what we are doing wrong.  Surely we cannot be doing it right at present; there must be a flaw somewhere which somebody must come across when doing research and ask whether we are achieving anything in that area.  I mention that point simply because it gives a graphic illustration of how wrong the Ministers and the IDA have got it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the need for the IDA to compete with other overseas <Col N="1495" /> countries for investment.  I mentioned in this House many times in the past that the east of Europe is in dire need of investment at present.  We all recognise that and we also recognise as our party Leader, Deputy John Bruton, said this morning that the EC have a duty to assist. We have also a duty to assist ourselves. Our employment encouragement incentives and investment agencies have a double duty to ensure that a reasonable share of that investment comes in our direction.  It is far better and more beneficial for an economy anywhere to gain investment which results in employment and further turnover in the community rather than what we have been doing in the past, going to Europe with a begging bowl seeking handouts to shore up the landslides which have taken place and which will only perpetuate and exacerbate an already difficult problem.  I would ask the Minister and his colleague from the Progressive Democrats to recognise that the scene is changing fast and what was successful in the forties, fifties and sixties is now outdated.  The stage is occupied by a number of participants who are in dire need of investment in their own countries and who are doing a great deal to procure that investment.  If we are not in a position to compete vigorously we will lose the battle.  Governments will change, Ministers will be thrown out of office, some will resign from time to time while others are sacked but at the end of the day the consumer, the constituents, the general public, are the people who suffer if we do not adapt and respond to the needs that arise at a particular time. I do not think we have done that in the last few years.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, it must be a moot point for those who are unemployed at Christmas to note and acknowledge what we are proposing to do in relation to this Bill.  I wonder whether they are as cynical as some of us here are.  I have no doubt they are.  Those who were unemployed last year and the previous year will see no prospect except that they may be in the same position next year.  An evaluation of the age structure of those who <Col N="1496" /> are unemployed at present illustrates the seriousness of the problem.  In my constituency of Kildare we have approximately 7,000 people who are unemployed, 80 per cent of whom are under 45 years of age and almost 50 per cent of those under 45 years of age are under 24.  If one takes a casual look at the situation one will see that for those over 45 years of age there is little prospect of their ever getting a job.  Unfortunately, that is the scene and the economic climate in which we live.  Even though there are many competent, capable and well qualified people of 46 and 47 years of age available and willing to work in this country when they go along anywhere to get a job they cannot even get one sweeping the footpath for the local authority.  The age barrier deprives them even of a simple mundane job.  That is a crazy situation and one which the Minister needs to look at urgently in his evaluation of the problem.</P>
    <P>I turn now to deal with those under the age of 45 who have a good life span ahead of them.  In my constituency almost 2,000 of these people are under 24, some of whom were employed last year but some came on to the labour market this year from the various schools and are now unemployed.  They have two prospects, one of which is unemployment.  I am aware this debate is not about social welfare but I would like to make a quick passing reference to the case of a 45 year old man who lives at home with his parents and receives £31 per week at Christmas time, based on an assessment against him of board and lodgings, the same applies to women.  Those people will look very carefully, coldly and callously at any proposals we have in relation to job creation in the future.  Unless the results of any changes are fairly dramatic they will become more and more cynical.  That is the reason the public are getting cunical about politics and public life.  When it is all boiled down they relate it directly to themselves and ask: what is in it for me? Is there anything at all?  Will anything change?  Will I still be unemployed tomorrow, next week or next year?  Will it be any different for my brother or sister <Col N="1497" /> who was unemployed last year or the year before?  When I am 45 years of age and if I happen to be out of a job will I have a chance of getting one?  Will there be a structure in place in Ireland which will be kind, caring and considerate enough to be able to provide for people like the father, mother, husband or wife who happen to be in that category at that particular time?</P>
    <P>Another matter I would like to raise, and one which has been the subject of criticism, is multinational corporate investment in this country.  There is evidence to suggest a repatriation of profits in many cases.  That is not good, it is undesirable, and is unhelpful.  Why do we give incentives to people who think it better to invest outside?  Mind you, some of our national companies are not unknown to go outside the country to make their investments which again is not desirable or helpful to our economy. There must be something wrong either with the taxation system on the cost, in terms of overheads, of running industry if big investors are anxious to invest outside the country given that there are certain incentives available to attract them in the first place.  If they find it necessary to set up offshore companies outside the country and to siphon their profits out of the country afterwards it is an indictment of the confidence they have in the system here.  There is a particular onus on the Government to introduce changes in the system which would ensure that it is more profitable and more attractive for those people to keep their money inside the country.  I know the very knowledgeable and learned arguments which will be trotted out but those excuses are unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The time has long since passed when we should make excuses.  We need evidence as to how we can attract those firms to make further investment in our economy.  There would be a huge benefit to the State and the only ones to suffer losses would be people outside the country. I know that there are currency difficulties but we use them just as excuses. Many national companies are making a big effort to invest outside of the country <Col N="1498" /> and we need to change the system to encourage them to invest their money where we want them to.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with profit. If business does not profit it does not survive.  Likewise business should pay its full share of taxes.  We have many multinational corporations providing jobs here and we do not always give them the recognition or support they deserve.  Our objective is to get employment and these companies deliver the jobs.  Let us hope they remain.  Where we fail is in encouraging them to expand sufficiently and to reinvest their money in our economy so that we can create more jobs.</P>
    <P>In Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, a huge effort is being made to attract foreign investment, and they are succeeding.  Since the realignment in Eastern Europe started there has been a huge number of new investments in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and so on by multinational corporations.  Some investment has taken place in EC countries close to the Eastern European border so that such companies will be in a position to launch into the new markets when the time is right.  We have not achieved enough in that regard.  We have allowed opportunities to slip.  Unless we become more incisive, more demanding and more competitive in attracting investment we will lose the battle and we will not serve our people in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that we are talking about industrial development now.  A few years ago a plan was launched to provide in the region of 6,500 extra jobs in the meat industry.  Those jobs did not materialise. At the end of 1991 the industry is in a sorry state.  In terms of national and international profile and in terms of the jobs that were supposed to be provided, we have failed.  There were more closures and more people made redundant than jobs produced in that sector.  It is a sad reflection on what in 1987 and 1988 we were led to believe would happen.  This sector needs to be looked at.  It is amazing that in a country where agriculture is so important and at a time when jobs are at a premium we are closing down research and development stations.  When jobs are <Col N="1499" /> needed research and development is being put on the back burner, yet in every worthwhile industry in Europe research and development is at the top of the agenda.  Without research and development a company does not rate well for very long.</P>
    <P>Last night on another Bill we asked the Minister whether any liabilities were involved and we got no reply.  We did not get any information as to whether liabilities were being transferred with the sale of one company to another.  It transpires that there is a possibility of very considerable liability.  The purpose of this Bill is to transfer the assets and liabilities of NADCORP to the IDA.  I wonder if any liabilities or commitments made by any subsidiaries of NADCORP will arise at some stage in the future.  Were letters of comfort given on behalf of any of those subsidiaries by NADCORP which might have a cost implication in the future? who will pick up the tab?  Do NADCORP's liabilities transfer to the IDA?  Will the IDA accept full responsibility for such commitments, letters of comfort or sweetheart deals?  Will the IDA accept commitments, entered into by NADCORP, any subsidiary of NADCORP or any commitment to employees, or anything that was implied which would be of benefit or otherwise to those employees?</P>
    <P>We do not want to hear about something which might develop at a later stage and we do not want to have to ask what might be embarrassing questions of the Minister.  We do not want to have continuous hassle in this House with Opposition Members having to wring information from Ministers, and Ministers screaming blue murder because they feel we are out to get them.  We are entitled to seek the information.  To protect Ministers from the possibility of something going wrong everything should be above board.  Everything should be disclosed here and we should not have the cat and mouse game for which this House has become famous in recent times.</P>
    <P>I note there is a proposal to make grants available for smaller industries, <Col N="1500" /> some of which may be service industries. That is dangerous.  I know it has been said that there should be grants for service industries and that is good up to a point.</P>
    <P>There comes a stage when if you grant-aid one service industry you have to counter grant-aid another and it becomes a vicious circle.  The best grant to industry in this country would be a tax incentive to encourage companies, from multinational corporations to small firms employing two or three people.  Such tax incentives would help to cover overheads and could be proportionate to the total number of people employed.  It is a simple expedient that would cost the firm nothing and save the Exchequer a considerable amount of money in social welfare. I will not go into it further because there are other people here who wish to speak and there will be another time to go into that in more detail.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down let me say that I am in favour of encouraging small industries. I think everybody in the House is.  But many make the mistake of going overboard in thinking that the small industry will be the saviour of our economy and solve our unemployment problems.  That is not so.  To do that we need big investment, multinational corporate investment of the kind that is capable of taking 50,000 or 60,000 people off the unemployment register.  We cannot indefinitely sustain the number of people who are unemployed now.  We must face that fact.  There are many in this House who would disagree with my views on that but I am prepared to state categorically that unless we get that kind of investment we will not be able to provide the numbers of jobs needed in the short time necessary.</P>
    <P>With that I will conclude.  No doubt we will have an opportunity to discuss it further on Committee Stage, short though the Committee Stage will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amalgamate the National Development Corporation with the IDA and to make amendments to the Industrial Development Act.  It is equally important that the financial limits under which the <Col N="1501" /> IDA operate be increased as proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The IDA have a very good record in the industrialisation of the country but many changes are needed.  Ten or 12 years ago we in this House were demanding advance factories in cluster units which, when provided, were never used because they were not suitable for particular industries which found they were better going into a green field development. Some of the cluster units, consisting of 3,000 square foot factories, had to be reconstructed into one factory which probably cost more than the building originally.</P>
      <P>The IDA have weathered many changes. They have changed now from capital grants to employment grants and are involved in research and development and marketing.  This is something we welcome because it is necessary in order to keep abreast of changes.  During those years a substantial amount of money was provided for food processing and slaughtering grants particularly in my own region.  At that time they were leaders in the field of technology.  Activity in these areas has diminished.  Because of EC regulations coming into force in 1992 many of these plants will have to pay millions of pounds for restructuring to adapt to the changing needs and demands and meet the restrictions being put on them.</P>
      <P>The broiler industry is a substantial employer in my region where we process 70 per cent of the national kill.  They now cannot compete on the export market and are dependent on a very substantial home market where white meat is becoming very popular.  To meet the regulations they require massive funding which many have not got.  Their only alternative is to go out of business and then there would be a flood of imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Import substitution is as important as exportation.  Under the regulations the IDA cannot provide grants because there companies are supplying the home market and do not have sufficient exports.  If they were to give even 5 per cent of the costs of that development the company would qualify for an EC <Col N="1502" /> FEOGA grant which under normal circumstances would be 35 per cent and 45 per cent in severely handicapped areas.</P>
    <P>I have appealed to the Minister on many occasions to do as is done in Britain, to facilitate these companies by giving them some grant to allow them to avail of FEOGA aid.  In the last couple of months we have heard that hundreds of millions of pounds of EC grant aid has not been taken up.  Where there is the opportunity the greatest possible use should be made of these grants.  All it would take in this instance is a small change of policy.</P>
    <P>The most important thing here at the moment is job creation.  Are we making the best possible use of the resources at our disposal?  I have doubts about that. When I came into this House about 20 years ago there were two tanneries in my area employing between 150 and 200 people.  At that time most of the hides would have been processed here. Because of export subsidies they started moving them out and they were processed elsewhere.  Now 80 per cent of hides are exported.  We should move back to using that very useful raw material which we have in abundance.  At the time I referred to, hides were not of good quality because of warble fly infestation, etc.  Now the hides are of superior quality and are being exported.</P>
    <P>Let me give another example.  In 1990 a gas distributor set up here and imported £3 million worth of gas cylinders, about 15,000 or 16,000 gas cylinders. I checked with people in the manufacturing and the engineering area who said it would be quite simple to design a prototype gas cylinder and manufacture them here.  Yet these cylinders were being imported at a time when many industries were working on short time.  The total value of gas cylinder imports came to £3 million.  With this amount of money we could keep up to 100 people in employment for up to 12 months.  When I raised this matter with the Minister he informed me that the number of gas cylinders imported in 1990 was exceptional due to the fact that this new distribution company has been set <Col N="1503" /> up and it was doubtful whether normal domestic demand alone would be adequate to justify the large capital investment to produce gas cylinders for the Irish market in competition with existing European producers.  However, the manufacturers I spoke to informed me that, if they were given advance notice that such a product would be put on the market, they would avail of the opportunity to use it.  The IDA should closely monitor developments and make people aware of the products that are about to be put on the market.</P>
    <P>The point I made in relation to the poultry industry and FEOGA aid should be examined with all due haste.  I have drawn the attention of the IDA, the Department and the Confederation of Irish Industry to the fact that practically every shed used in the poultry industry has to be imported.  I put it to them, at a time when they are whingeing and whining about the downturn in the building and construction industry, that they should make sure that as many items as possible are manufactured here.  I accept that we are operating in a free market but we should utilise our resources to the maximum.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should say that the IDA have changed and are doing good work.  We could probably egg them on by criticising them to ensure that they take note of any developments which they can see on the horizon, no matter how distant, in an effort to ensure that the jobs which are urgently needed are created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a brief contribution to the debate.  I welcomed the National Development Corporation Bill when it was introduced in the House in 1986 because I believed there was a necessity for the State to provide equity for companies.  That Bill presented us with an opportunity to invest in the west and I illustrated some examples of projects which could have been proceeded with in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, since then the National Development Corporation have been <Col N="1504" /> allowed to languish.  While they have made some investments I do not think they have met the need to provide serious funds for joint ventures or stand alone projects in the west.  Their demise however reflects the lack of thinking in the Department of Industry and Commerce. I do not believe the Minister will ever see major development in the natural regions.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the bishops and others who attended the western conference were so alarmed about the position in relation to job creation was that they could not see where the finance for projects was going to come from.  For instance, there is a clear need to enhance tourist attractions in the west.  One of the ideas promoted by hoteliers in the west around 1986 was the provision of international conference centres, covering both the tourism and business aspects, for which funding should be provided.  I said at that time that infrastructure in the tourism sector had been partially developed in Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Clare and Kerry.  Insufficient accommodation however is available in those areas to meet the demand that would be created if such a development were to take place.  The mandate of the National Development Corporation therefore should have been expanded to allow them invest in these areas, but the Government refused to do so and no such development has taken place.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed the abandonment of the west.  It is ironic that the Deputies who welcomed the proposed expansion of the remit of the IDA and SFADCo were from the west.  They obviously see our salvation in both those bodies, but I think they are wrong.  People in the west have no confidence because they do not have the venture capital required.  If the Minister sets up a regional body will the necessary capital be provided?  If some of our neighbours, such as Germany or other developed countries who are interested in the principle of cohesion, present us with proposals, where would the venture capital come from, given that we have dampened down the business <Col N="1505" /> expansion scheme and are now exterminating NADCORP?  This is a sad day.</P>
    <P>I criticise the decision to allow the IDA and SFADCo to provide equity because I do not believe they have the necessary ability to control it.  I have not been impressed by some of the investments they have made, particularly in my constituency. The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, knows exactly what I am talking about.  I do not know if this has been mentioned already but Shannon Development, in a joint venture with European investors, have sought to develop a modern marina at Kilrush, called the Kilrush Creek Marina.  This is a very laudable project but it has been stalled because of a lack of funds.  It is clear that Shannon Development do not have the ability to manage the equity invested.  There are rumours of sweetheart deals and that the private sector are being invited in, but this will serve to lessen the confidence of local people. Indeed, it is an insult to those who have invested in the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation would have been in a position to advise those who wish to invest equity, to control it and promote the project concerned.  In this Bill the Minister is wiping out an opportunity to expand the remit of the National Development Corporation by allowing them to enter joint ventures in the industrial, tourism and services sectors.</P>
    <P>Since 1960, since the inception of the industrial estate at Shannon, the mid west has prospered and there has been solid employment.  It was not until the introduction of schemes such as the urban renewal scheme that Limerick or Ennis experienced an upsurge in business confidence and undertook development. Allied with the business expansion scheme, people are investing in developments, but not at a rate that will create sufficient jobs to keep young people in these areas.  If equity is wiped out we will be dependent on SFADCo or the IDA for development.  While SFADCo have a definite role to play in the promotion of <Col N="1506" /> industry I am not sure that they are good managers of funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech today seemed to imply that he sees an enhanced role for the IDA and SFADCo in this area.  However, he should have outlined his proposals for the IDA and what their new role will be.  If one looks around the country they can see the debacles that lie in their wake.  As I have said locally, both the IDA and SFADCo are in such a rut that people have no confidence in them. With the new treaty, there is an opportunity to develop the regions.  Corporations such as NADCORP should be allowed operate with equity.  If we have to rely on the involvement of the IDA or SFADCo in all aspects of industrial development marketing, and so on we might as well nationalise the entire industry of the country.  Given the ideology of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>And Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is not likely to happen.  This Bill will not work unless the Minister clearly illustrates his plans for the expansion of the role of SFADCo and the IDA in job creation.  The Minister should have published the report of the committee before bringing this Bill before the House.  I cannot understand how a man like Deputy O'Malley, who when he was on this side of the House protested so much about giving Ministers a blank cheque, can turn around and ask this House to give him a blank cheque for industrial promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said nothing about the scale of unemployment, the number of young people in despair as a result of unemployment or those in third level institutions or universities whose future is very bleak.  The Minister should have taken this opportunity to publish the industrial review and to give details of his proposals for the future.  It is not acceptable to ask the House to give a blank cheque to abolish NADCORP and to increase the funds of SFADCo and the IDA and let them run higgledy piggledy <Col N="1507" /> around the country.  They have run higgledy piggledy around my constituency. The IDA bought a site in a bog outside Ennis after refusing an offer from the local county manager and entrepreneur, who is now chairman of SFADCo, of reasonably developed land.  That land has been laying fallow ever since.  Thousands of pounds have been invested in it but it has never been developed.  The position is the same all over the country, with factories lying idle in many areas.</P>
    <P>How will the equity base be expanded in the IDA and what control will they have?  Will SFADCo have any control? For example, did they exercise control in the marina project?  For instance, did they have any say in the marketing and entertainment bills that mounted up for this marina?  The people of Kilrush wanted something new and they got it in the marina?  That marina has been developed but there is not sufficient investment for further development. Maybe with the passage of this Bill SFADCo will intervene or maybe some sweetheart deal will be done.  That would not be unknown to happen in this area. I am sure my colleague, Deputy Michael Finucane, will remember the Rent an Irish Cottage scheme in this area.  It was only when there was a public outcry about the sale of shares by SFADCo in Rent an Irish Cottage and they were forced to sell that action was taken.  Allegations swept the mid-west about sweetheart deals and one still hears of them. Is that the way we want our affairs run by so-called independent companies such as the IDA or SFADCo?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, in any future Bills on this matter, to publish beforehand his proposals for industrial development and reform of the IDA and SFADCo.  I hope that he takes note of the way companies in the EC operate. For instance, the Leader programme has been made available and note should be taken of it.  The promotion work carried out by voluntary bodies and local authorities should be recognised.  I hope that we will not witness a ruination of our countryside and the loss of more young <Col N="1508" /> people.  I am very disappointed that the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, introduced this Bill without examining the proposal more thoroughly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as possible because I understand that Deputy Garland wants to contribute also.  This Bill is urgently needed in view of the capitalisation with regard to the Industrial Development Authority and SFADCo.  I agree with Deputy Carey in that it is time for a re-examination of the future role of industrial development.  Considering the action taken by the IDA with regard to industrial development in recent years&mdash; there is need for a lot more development &mdash; there is a desire to review their future role.  Deputies from all sides of this House are blamed for the lack of industrial development in our areas but industrial development cannot take place if the climate and the incentives do not exist which would allow companies compete on an even footing for capital investment.</P>
      <P>We should ask the IDA to examine what they see as the future target markets. They have targeted reasonably successfully the high tech market over the past number of years but this is becoming extremely competitive and they will find they will not be able to compete with their Japanese counterparts especially in the opening up of the worldwide trade. It is important that we look at the future role of the IDA in the context of its future role worldwide.  We can no longer look at industrial development in the context of Europe but will have to look at it in the context of the world market.  We will have to find areas in which we can surpass all others in terms of turning out a superior product at a competitive price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA will have to look for sectors on which to concentrate their efforts. They will have to examine the possibilities of our prime industries, namely agriculture and fishing.  At present in many cases we sell a primary product which then goes on for further processing in other countries.  We have recently completed a review of the Common Agricultural Policy and it is obvious that Irish <Col N="1509" /> agriculture needs to reach out for further processing opportunities.  There are markets available to us which are not being pursued.  At present intervention is seen as the gravy train for beef and butter producers.  There are opportunities in the marketplace to provide products that the consumer wants, but we are not meeting that challenge.</P>
    <P>The need to review the IDA is paramount. The Minister quite rightly says in his speech that he is reviewing the situation and waiting for the report of the review body, but I hope that as soon as the report of the review body becomes available it will be brought before the Members of this House and we will be given the opportunity to debate it prior to any legislation being put in place to implement its recommendations.</P>
    <P>We have to examine how the peripheral areas have fared in recent times. I come from an area which has suffered to the greatest extent from unemployment and emigration over the past 20 years. The IDA offer grants but people who are willing to invest in industry find them insufficient to entice them to locate in peripheral areas such as Leitrim or Sligo. Last year's IDA report bears this out. The total IDA expenditure on job incentives in County Leitrim for the year 1990 was £622,000.  That level of investment is not acceptable to the people of County Leitrim.  People wonder why the young people are leaving County Leitrim; they are leaving because there are no jobs. We have a highly educated young population, as we have the highest ratio of students going on to third level education in the country.  But we are preparing our graduates to take their place elsewhere in the world and not at home, where many of them would love to be.  They have to go to Dublin or the big cities in Europe or America.  It is important that we reap the benefits of our investment in education and we need to create jobs that will use the talents of our people.  The talent is readily available.  The IDA should concentrate on industries being sourced in the north west which would take on the graduates from the regional colleges in Sligo, Letterkenny and <Col N="1510" /> Athlone.  The regional technical colleges are turning out superior students who are able to command the best jobs.  They have had the benefit of our fine educational system but we are losing their wealth of talent because they have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>We should look at the question of import substitution in the light of the present economic climate.  The colliery at Arigna, which is in my constituency, has been closed for the past 12 months.  The IDA then offered incentives for people to set up businesses in that area.  To date few jobs have resulted from those incentives. I think it is time the Department of Energy examined the possibility of using the major reserves of coal by continuing to maintain the power station until such time as this natural resource is exhausted.  I know that this may not come within the ambit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but it offers the opportunity to consolidate employment opportunities in that area.</P>
    <P>We have not highlighted the benefits of a clean environment and the superior products we are producing.  We should do that.  We should consider marketing this country as an industrial base and draw attention to the fact that our environment is superior to that of our European competitors.</P>
    <P>At present the IDA will offer employment grants and not capital grants to small industries.  We should have this examined.  If somebody is willing to invest his own money he is entitled at least to get some type of capital aid towards job creation.  In many situations people are only offered employment grants.  A marriage of both grants would create jobs in the west, but one alone does nothing to ease our problems.  Very shortly industrial development will be concentrated in a few large centres and the peripheral areas will be cast aside and will be left for forestation.  Large tracts of land will be taken out of production and the inhabitants of rural Ireland will move to the larger towns.  If that should happen it is a recipe for disaster both socially and economically.  We should <Col N="1511" /> fight against this happening at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>This is enabling legislation which provides for the dissolution of NADCORP and increases the money available to the IDA and SFADCo.  I was in the Opposition when NADCORP was set up and I thought it had a good future.  But it has proved to me that if people do not invest their own money the venture will not be as successful as if they were investing their own money in it.  We need a more liberal system of grant aid.  If we are to have development in the west we need to talk in terms of grant aid of up to 80 per cent.  It is much more attractive for an investor to receive grants at the rate of 25 or 30 per cent and locate within ten or 15 miles of Dublin than to receive 80 per cent grant to locate in the west.  The problems associated with a peripheral location include loss of time and the extra cost of transporting goods to and from the industry.  If we are going to level the pitch for industrial development we will have to ensure that industries are given at least 80 per cent grant aid towards job creation.  Anyone who says it can be made attractive with anything less than that level of grant is living in cloud cuckoo-land.</P>
    <P>I promised at the outset that I would not take up too much time as I know that Deputy Garland wishes to speak for a few minutes.  However, it is important that the House be given an opportunity to debate the review as soon as it is available. Members should be given an opportunity to make sure that the pitch will be level for future industrial development and that the peripheral regions receive a fair and equitable share of what is available in the area of job creation.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for allowing me time to make a short contribution and I commend him on some of what he has had to say.  The Deputy referred to import substitution, which is extremely important.  Import substitution is as economically beneficial as are exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> It is apparent from listening to Deputy Ellis and Deputies on the other side of the House also that there is a good deal of disquiet about the blank cheque that is being given to the IDA.  There is an immense amount of money involved, and the Government are demonstrating a great deal of trust in an organisation that clearly have not functioned in the way they were intended to function.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I oppose the Bill but I agree with those sections of it providing for the dissolution of the ill-fated National Development Corporation.  I am opposed to the main thrust of the Bill, which deals with the provision of further money to the IDA.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation were clearly doomed to failure from the start.  Set up in 1986 by the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government it was a cynical exercise in supposed job creation.  The corporation did not work and could never have worked.</P>
    <P>The merging of what is left of the National Development Corporation with the IDA is not being given a mark of approval, so far as the Green Party are concerned, for the activities of the IDA. The position is quite to the contrary.  In fact, one could list in great detail the many failures of the IDA.  For me, probably their greatest failure concerned a campaign in which I was involved shortly after I was elected to the Dáil, that was the very successful campaign to keep Merrill Dow &mdash; the multinational chemical company &mdash; out of this country.  How much is known in the House about the negotiating ability of the IDA?  They have their hand out for another £30 million or £40 million &mdash; in fact, they do not even have to ask for it, they are going to be given the money and asked to account for it afterwards.</P>
    <P>How much confidence can one have in the negotiating ability of the IDA when one considers what happened with Merrill Dow?  That chemical company on coming into Ireland were offered an excellent site in Ringaskiddy, a chemical industrial estate.  They were offered all of the usual training grants, tax breaks <Col N="1513" /> and so on but they were not satisfied. They had to have a green field site.  Somehow or other, Merrill Dow managed to persuade the IDA that they would not move into Ringaskiddy.  I am sure the company would have gone to Ringaskiddy if the IDA had called their bluff but, of course, the IDA did not do that. Instead, the company were offered a green field site, in addition to all of the other advantages such as tax breaks they had been offered.  The IDA went completely overboard in offering Merrill Dow a green field site.  Fortunately, due to the vigilance of the local people, that industry was kept out of Killeagh in east Cork.  That is just an instance that the House knows about.  What about all of the other plants that have probably received excessive grants?  The whole issue is an absolute scandal and needs to be publicly investigated.</P>
    <P>When one examines the record of the IDA one has to admit that jobs were created.  However, they have been bought at an extremely high price to the taxpayer.  In the past year alone the IDA received subvention of £137 million from the Exchequer.  There has to be a question mark over the permanence and stability of much of the IDA investment. According to information I have from the Minister, in the past ten years no fewer than 167 overseas companies closed, with a loss of 4,800 jobs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the poor value for money given by IDA grants, even more important is the tremendous and continuing environmental damage caused to this country by the attraction of &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; industries in the pursuance of the &ldquo;job at any cost&rdquo; policy of successive Governments. Due to the crazy industrial policy of all Governments for many years past, industrial employment not only has not increased but has reduced.  The wholesale closure of much of our indigenous industry has resulted in tremendous job losses and has cost us more jobs than have been created by the IDA.</P>
    <P>The complete bankruptcy of Ireland's industrial policy was recognised at long last by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Albert Reynolds, when he said <Col N="1514" /> recently that the reason for our high unemployment was our over-reliance on international investment to create jobs. He advocated the creation of native based industry which, he said, while slower and not as glamorous as announcing an American firm coming in with 1,000 jobs, was still the only way in the end.  Tacit recognition of that view appears in the Minister's speech today. To that extent, the Minister must be commended, though his is a very late conversion.</P>
    <P>I suppose the IDA will have to continue in some form or other for some time, though their subsidy from the Exchequer should be reduced considerably. However, the thrust of the IDA must be towards more labour intensive industry using native raw materials and being natively owned.  It is very important that as much of our industry as possible is owned by people here.  One has only to have regard to the balance of payments every year to realise just how huge is the amount of money &mdash; thousands of millions of pounds &mdash; lost to this country because of the repatriation of profits made by multinational companies. That is money that would otherwise probably be re-invested in our economy to create further jobs.  This denotes a tremendous defect in our whole policy.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputy Ellis, and one on which I would agree, is that there should be a very heavily built-in bias towards siting industry in the counties of the western seaboard, for example.  Much industry has been set up in Dublin, again due to the poor negotiating ability of the IDA who allowed industry to come into Dublin to the extent that Dublin has grown much too large and unmanageable.  We do not want more people here in Dublin, we want people to stay in the regions and be employed there.  That is where they want to be and that is where we want them to be.  Regional employment is a good deal all around for everyone.  It makes much more sense to keep people in the regions, which have a good stock of existing houses, serviced sites, etc. than to bring them to Dublin and put a burden on the <Col N="1515" /> taxpayer and the ratepayers of Dublin to provide more serviced sites and houses, when there is adequate housing in country areas.  We must bring the jobs to the people, not the people to the jobs.  That is not an ideological point, it is a very practical point and it is a concept that should be taken on board.</P>
    <P>Considering the amount of money spent on the IDA and the present unemployment figure of 260,000 we must accept that with the best will in the world there is no way the IDA, SFADCo, FáS or any other Government agency can absorb more than a fraction of those people.  Indeed it is a result of the crazy industrial policies advocated by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>The way forward is a very different one.  We need to restructure our economy, providing paid work for all who require it, which can be achieved by reduced working hours, career breaks, job sharing and early retirement.  Such a scheme would be greatly facilitated by the introduction of a guaranteed, basic income for all citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that the National Development Corporation is being abolished, particularly when there is much publicity surrounding our massive unemployment problem.  Having been established in 1986 NADCORP have had a very short period within which to prosper.  It is significant also that they could have created up to 2,000 jobs.  The most essential element of their role <i>vis-à-vis</i> industrialists was that NADCORP could invest capital in companies when other commercial institutions rejected investment by such industrialists.  Therefore, it was essential that there be a body such as NADCORP.  If anything, perhaps there was not sufficient publicity given to their role particularly in the way in which they could help out industries.  We are all aware that if banks and other institutions regard an industrial project as doubtful they will be reluctant to invest money in it.  It is significant that the IDA and SFADCo &mdash; who it would appear will embrace some of the present role of <Col N="1516" /> NADCORP &mdash; are experiencing great difficulty in attracting industry here.  I am pleased to see the Minister present.  He will be as familiar with the mid-west region, where there may well be a very confused position as regards industry.  I heard many speakers today extol the virtues of SFADCo, but they may not be as familiar with the confusing scene there as we are in the area.  Employers may well be somewhat confused now about the role of SFADCo, in that the IDA are involved in industries in the area almost by remote control, with their executive arm based in Dublin and no regional office for the mid-west region.  We have also experienced difficulty in attracting industry, although the Minister represents the area.  However, I would hope that industrious bodies would continue to attract such industry.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Carey mention earlier the Kilrush marina project which has gained much publicity.  I have been down to see it, a laudable project, undertaken by SFADCo although I am not so sure about its marketing potential.  I trust their hopes will be fulfilled and that they will attract the overseas boats anticipated when the project was being built.  Of course, the estuary where it is located has tremendous potential; and Foynes will supplement it with a very successful satellite marina and hopefully Glin who are also seeking a marina.  I hope those projects will be given the requisite funding to ensure their success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One criticism of the IDA I have often heard voiced is that most industrialists will be attracted to locate in any small town not only by the package of grants available, but also by the prospect of being able to live in harmony with the local community.  Very often the itineraries arranged for foreign industrialists to come here and visit many locations act as a disincentive in that the speed with which they travel throughout the country does not permit them to meet the local people who count, for example, chambers of commerce representatives, local bank managers and so on.  Two projects successfully initiated in Newcastlewest by overseas industrialists was due to the fact <Col N="1517" /> that they took a concerted decision to meet the local community, and were impressed by their enthusiasm and commitment, so that they now feel part of that community.  Therefore, in arranging such itineraries one would be better to concentrate on quality rather than quantity in proposing locations.  Question marks can be raised about such exercises.</P>
    <P>The Shannon estuary has attracted much welcome overseas industry, principally due to the dynamic harbour board located at Foynes.  Of course, they are attracted there because of the tremendous advantage of the River Shannon. Indeed the Shannon estuary often has been described as the jewel of the western world.  Probably there has not been sufficient heavy industry attracted there. I very much welcome the recent SFADCo role in marketing, particularly in relation to the promotion of the estuary, tapping top companies likely to site mobile overseas industrial projects there. It would be my hope to attract such industry to the estuary, thereby providing much needed jobs.  We believe there may be an imminent announcement of the location of a chemical plant in the estuary outside Askeaton.  Let us hope it will come to fruition.  Industry must be important with our current 260,000 people unemployed.  I saw school children in the Visitors Gallery this afternoon. Seeing these students streaming out of schools one often asks oneself where they will get jobs.  In that respect we cannot rely totally on industrial promotion agencies like the Industrial Credit Corporation and the IDA.  The biggest recent growth has taken place in the tourism sector.  Another welcome development has been the expansion of the agritourism sector, much needed in view of farmers' declining incomes.  It is understandable that the £5 million allocated was rapidly taken up, and there is now a waiting list.  I hope Ministers will be successful in getting another commitment from Brussels for its further expansion, thus supplementing farmers' incomes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey referred earlier to the many large hotels we have in the mid-west region attracting overseas visitors. <Col N="1518" /> Perhaps one of the reasons for their success has been that they have laid on many leisure activities such as golf and so on. A few have been grant-assisted accompanied by a certain amount of publicity. It is my belief that, even if such leisure facilities had not been provided, such hotels would still be there because the amount of money involved is small. Indeed it may well create a certain amount of envy on the part of many smaller hoteliers endeavouring to maintain family businesses, wanting to expand their operations but who feel they are not being helped by Bord Fáilte or anybody else.  If we are serious about our commitment to tourism, then we must also be serious about upgrading many of our hotels.  Rather than spending money on leisure facilities for larger hotels there should be some encouragement given to smaller hoteliers.</P>
    <P>There has been much recent incentive to people to engage in forestry, as a great deal of our land is not suitable for agricultural purposes.  It is my understanding that Coillte Teo had made a considerable advance in attracting a large pulp industry here to utilise our forestry produce.  I hope we will eventually get that industry. While encouraging people to invest in forestry we must also find an outlet for the wood produced.  Undoubtedly there are many areas to be tapped outside of tourism, forestry and so on in the creation of long term jobs.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the appointment of a provisional liquidator to a company in West Limerick, Kantogher Poultry Products.  The liquidator is to run the company over the Christmas season.  I hope he succeeds in finding a buyer so that the enterprise can remain in the area and retain its 130 employees.  It provides a vital lifetime for the community and it would be a body blow if anything untoward happened to the company.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation never seriously got a chance to get off the ground, yet they provided a very useful service for companies which found it difficult to get support from the banks.  It is regrettable that they are to be absorbed into the IDA rather than <Col N="1519" /> expanded.  They certainly did not receive the publicity they deserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I will shed no tears over the abolition of the National Development Corporation.  I have long held the view that there has been a multiplicity of agencies trying to promote industrial development &mdash; FáS, SFADCo, NADCORP, the IDA and even Bord Fáilte.  There are also a number of agencies in the food industry. The duplication of services provided by these agencies will not create one extra job.  I welcome the decision to restructure State agencies which are involved in industrial promotion.  This is the only way forward.  In the past we have had too many executives, too many plush offices and too many people running around the country without any brief to justify their existance.  I am glad the Minister for Industry and Commerce has decided to deal with this matter and to get down to the creation of long term, sustainable jobs.  The review of industrial development policy to which the Minister referred is long overdue.  I hope the report will be available in the near future and that we will have an opportunity to debate it, so that we can make suggestions on the appropriate action.</P>
      <P>The IDA are at a crossroads in their development.  People in my part of the country feel we are not getting a fair deal from them in regard to job creation structures.  There is a perception, which to some extent I share, that the major cities are getting Rolls Royce treatment from the IDA while the rest of the country is being neglected.  I come from a country which many people seem to think is very healthy and without any problems. It has been proved, however, that we have the highest unemployment rate in the country in respect of both adults and youths.  Despite repeated requests to the IDA over many years, we are not getting the support and the backup services we deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the fifties and sixties, jobs in the country were in traditional industries. We had a number of bacon factories, <Col N="1520" /> Clover Meats, Buttles, Denny's.  There was also flour milling and a number of other agriculture-related industries. Unfortunately they did not change with the times and they all closed down.  We did not see any fire brigade action from the IDA or any high powered ministerial cars rushing to the county to deal with our problems.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, came to Enniscorthy and set in motion the building of an advance factory which was completed some months ago.  We appreciate that, but we have not got from the IDA the services we deserve.  We have the port of Rosslare and vast amounts of money have been spent by Wexford County Council on infrastructural development, roads, sewerage schemes and so on.  The Minister should ensure that in future the IDA see themselves as having a duty to support the whole country and do not simply pin their colours to the mast in the major cities.</P>
    <P>There are 320 million people in the European market.  Surely we can create jobs in the food industry and related industries.  A number of speakers have said that we should not have a begging bowl mentality, but we must put our problems into focus.  We have over twice the average European unemployment rate.  I believed when we joined the EC that countries on the periphery would be helped.  I have no hang up about the Minister for Industry and Commerce getting special concessions in regard to job creation.  The unemployed will welcome whatever support we can get from the EC.  We need direct and immediate support and our Ministers must exert pressure within the Community to ensure that we get it.</P>
    <P>The IDA should become involved in direct job support.  At present a small company starting up must be committed to exports before they can get money from the IDA.  This policy must be reviewed.  I should like to see a grant per job created in any field, not necessarily related to exports.  Tourism and forestry are areas of great potential which need to be developed further.</P>
    <P>I sought permission to raise on the <Col N="1521" /> Adjournment the proposed closure by Teagasc of the soft fruit centre at Clonroche in County Wexford, but I was told that it was not a matter for the Government. In my opinion it is a matter for the Government.  This is the only soft fruit research station in the country and it is situated in the area which is the heart of the soft fruit industry.  There is tremendous scope for job creation in this field. The closure of this research station would be very sad.  Joe Rea, Dr. Pearse Ryan, an eminent County Wexford man, and the other board members of Teagasc need to look again at this issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to transfer the activities of NADCORP to the IDA.  The Minister should continue along this road in seeking to eliminate much of the bureaucracy and red tape which exists at present.  He should bring all these agencies in this area together so that they can work towards the creation of long term sustainable jobs for our young people. As Deputy Finucane said, we wonder what the future holds for the thousands of young people now at school.  It is up to all of us to put forward proposals on how we can solve our unemployment problem and create jobs for our young people in the future.  I believe the Minister is going in the right direction in this respect.  I hope he will bring the review of industrial policy before this House so that we will have a further opportunity of putting forward proposals on the creation of jobs for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I understand other Deputies wish to contribute and the Minister may wish to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons I wanted to contribute to this debate is that the Labour Party were responsible for putting forward the concept of a national development corporation when they were in Government.  We had difficulty in convincing our partners in Government, Fine Gael, that there was a need for such a body.  There were some differences between the parties on the functions of the agency.  Having listened to Deputy <Col N="1522" /> Browne, I realise that many people did not fully understand what NADCORP were about and what role they played. Unlike FáS and the IDA, they were not set up to attract enterprises into the country.  They were the vehicle by which the State could make capital available for joint venture projects between the State and the private sector, a concept to which all parties in the House subscribe.  They were set up to assist people in the private sector who, because of the prohibitions which existed, found it difficult to get their industries off the ground.  The Labour Party decided there was a need for a national development corporation who could provide assistance to such people.  The decision to abolish NADCORP and swallow them up in the IDA is contrary to what the Labour Party fought and argued for and managed to achieve when they were in Government.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with NADCORP is that they were never properly funded by the Government.  Sufficient capital funding was not made available to allow them to be adventurous in supporting industry.  A case was made to NADCORP for assistance to be given to the redundant workers who set up a tannery in Carrick-on-Suir.  However, because of a lack of funding by the State this worthwhile scheme, like many other schemes, which would have given employment, failed to get off the ground. This was not the fault of the corporation. It was probably due to the lack of funding given to the corporation.</P>
    <P>I accept that the IDA have a specific role.  I do not want to get involved in a debate on how effective they are or how well SFADCo are perceived to be doing. Those agencies are confined to grant-aiding companies involved in the manufacturing and exporting areas.  However, grant assistance could be given by them to the many projects in the tourist industry which give employment.  I ask the Minister in the review of the role of the IDA to see to it that grant assistance is given to people who create employment.  At a time when there are over 250,000 people on the live register it is essential that all State agencies play their part in trying to <Col N="1523" /> create jobs and give assistance to people in the private sector who provide jobs. Even though we have responded to their requests for a proper environment and a proper tax regime, the private sector have not managed to create the number of jobs we expected them to create.  Up to now the private sector have been very slow to create jobs in areas where there has been no gilt edged guarantee of profits. I accept that there are difficulties in the private sector.  For example, every other day in my constituency service industries are being closed down and workers are being made redundant.  This is especially sad at Christmas time.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are opposed to the abolition of NADCORP or its absorption into another agency where the concept of State involvement in joint venture projects with the private sector could be lost. What could be more perfect in a mixed economy like ours than that concept?  It is a pity the Government have moved away from that concept.  We fought hard in Government for the establishment of NADCORP and we regard the decision to now kill them off as tragic.  The Labour Party want to register their protest against this decision.  I promised to be very brief in order go give other Members a chance to contribute.  However, my brevity should not be interpreted as a lack of feeling about what will happen to this corporation for which the Labour Party fought long and hard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous Fine Gael speakers have outlined their opposition to the Bill.  NADCORP were set up to provide State and private sector investment in joint venture projects.  Even though the principle was good, they were only mildly successful.  My greatest fear is that this Bill will give the IDA a blank cheque in so far as joint venture projects are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past number of years the IDA have not been as successful as they should have been in the creation of jobs.  Unfortunately, the unemployment and emigration figures are still rising.  The structures of the IDA need to be changed <Col N="1524" /> so that they can concentrate more on the creation of employment.  Multinational companies are given large grants to set up here, but unfortunately when the tax incentives are no longer attractive they disappear.  They leave behind them a workforce who cannot get any other employment.  Irish entrepreneurs and native industries should be given incentives to create employment.  For example, employment could be created in the area of import substitution.</P>
    <P>A number of Irish entrepreneurs and industrialists are striving to maintain employment.  However, they are finding it difficult to do this because they are not receiving the grant aid they deserve from the IDA.  They are willing to remain in Ireland because their families are here and they have been born and reared here and have a loyalty to this country.  That is something we have misjudged during the past number of years where we have tried to give multinationals more incentives to set up here.  There are some multinational companies in Ireland who have been and will continue to be loyal. At this stage the incentive must be given to the native employer and the native industrialist.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim we have the Arigna Collieries, which was a native industry promoting the sale and mining of coal for delivery to a power station.  Over the past 12 or 18 months the power station is being run down, but there is still an enormous quantity of coal available to be mined.  The people who are willing to do this work should be given the incentive to sustain jobs.  Some 250 industrial jobs were lost in a small area. During the past 18 months various types of incentives have been given by FáS and the IDA but no jobs have been created.  If the IDA were to look favourably on the type of work that could be done in that area a number of necessary jobs could be created in the Arigna catchment area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland made a very valid point in his contribution in regard to the situation that exists at present where people are brought to jobs in large industrialised urban areas rather than jobs being brought to the people in rural <Col N="1525" /> Ireland.  If we look at the census of population figures we will see that the number of people who have left rural Ireland is incredible.  The Minister will have to look at the situation within the IDA and give extra grant incentives to industrialists who are willing to set up businesses in the west.  If two people are given the same amount of grant, one to set up in Dublin and the other to set up in Leitrim, unfortunately they will both choose Dublin because of its proximity to ports etc., so the person who wishes to move to the west would have to be given an extra incentive.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make relates to afforestation, which has been growing at the expense of people.  There is much potential in afforestation in the industrial sense.  We could have a woodpulp plant; which has been referred to in this House on a number of occasions by Deputies from all sides, in which the IDA could play a major role.  They have been in discussion with a number of Swedish and Finnish companies in an effort to establish a woodpulp industry here under a joint venture programme, but unfortunately they have not been successful. They will have to be more aggressive to ensure that a woodpulp industry is established, particularly in the northwest. In the light of the difficulties in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim I would like to see that industry established in the Arigna catchment areas as promised.  We have the necessary raw materials for this industry and many jobs would be created. At present people from the North are taking out the wood and having it pulped in Northern Ireland.  If proper grant aid was provided we could have that industry in the Republic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people may welcome this Bill because increased funding is being provided for both the IDA and SFADCo.  The first matter that ought to be addressed is the performance of both agencies.  That should be greater accountability to this House in relation to how the finances have been provided, where they have been allocated, the type of grant aid provided and the approach <Col N="1526" /> adopted by both agencies in relation to tackling the unemployment problem and the emigration problem which are continuing to create major problems for the future of industry in this country.  It would be better had the Minister addressed those issues from that point of view rather than bring this Bill before us.</P>
      <P>While some people suggest that NADCORP has underperformed, I think it can be said that since 1987 they have not received the same level of support from the Government and no effort was made to promote the development work of NADCORP.  Had a more vigorous approach been adopted by the Department of Industry and Commerce in promoting NADCORP from 1987 onwards there would be more people employed in Ireland, there would be more joint ventures between State and private agencies, but unfortunately, that has taken place only to a limited extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA, and SFADCo in particular, are fine agencies in their own right, but how seriously have they tackled the unemployment problem in the peripheral regions?  How have SFADCo performed in relation to providing employment in the region for which they have responsibility, namely, Clare, Limerick, north Tipperary and north Kerry?.  While the Minister proposes to increase their funding from £130 million to £150 million, we in that region would like to hear greater details as to what they have done with the finance and what they propose doing with it in the future.  The public at large are disappointed at the lack of performance, particularly in County Clare, where jobs are not being provided.  Is the Minister aware of the number of jobs that have been created in Kilrush, Kilkee, Ennistymon, Lahinch, Ennis, Killaloe and Scarriff?  They claim it is easy to create jobs in an area which has industry and where a certain amount of expansion is taking place within existing companies. Both agencies have failed abysmally to create and develop employment in our indigenous industries and particularly in the food industry.  SFADCo and the IDA took a decision three of four years ago to promote the food industry.  What have <Col N="1527" /> they achieved?  How many new jobs have they created in that sector?  How successful have they been in that area?</P>
    <P>This House is being asked to provide additional moneys because the existing limits will be spent before the end of December.  Few people are happy with the performance of these organisations. Parents whose children are in New York or in Sydney this Christmas are not happy with the performance of these agencies and are very concerned about the future for the children who remain at home. They are not confident that those agencies will be able to put in place the type of jobs needed for the future.  Had the Government given NADCORP greater teeth and encouragement we could have more jobs in the food industry, which is a natural resource and for which there is a market; but we have not managed to market our produce because these agencies have not taken the matter seriously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds referred to the whole area of afforestation and the creation of a woodpulp factory in Leitrim. These are issues which appear to be too troublesome for the agencies to address and, unfortunately, many areas are left <Col N="1528" /> stranded without jobs.  While this Bill may in one sense appear attractive, it is most unattractive to the general public because these agencies are not doing the job they were intended to do.  They feel that these agencies are not doing the job they were intended to do.  The IDA have traditionally been a grant aid organisation. NADCORP were set up for a very definite developmental joint venture purpose.  I fail to see how the IDA whose performance to date leaves a lot to be desired are now to have that extra bit of commitment and extra ingenuity within themselves.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Media Reports on HIV Virus Infection.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this urgent matter in the Dáil this evening.  I hope that nothing I have to say on this sensitive matter will be misrepresented. What I have to say follows on the recent newspaper reports which confirm that three practising doctors in Ireland have been diagnosed as HIV positive.</P>
      <P>These reports have led to widespread public concern, particularly following the tragic death in the US of a patient who contracted the HIV virus from her dentist. There is concern throughout the country about the risk of infection from doctors treating them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to keep this contribution brief because this is a sensitive issue.  It is intended to bring to the Minister's attention the concerns patients have and to <Col N="1531" /> allow her the opportunity to put on the record of the House the steps being taken by the Department of Health to allay public concern in this area.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, there is no question of a judgmental attitude on my part to the unfortunate infected doctors whose own lives are now at risk from this dreaded disease of AIDS.  Our only responsibility in this House is to the well being of patients and the concept of the GMS in the Republic.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of public concern I am sure the Department are aware of.  I am sure action has been taken but we should use this forum to inform people of the procedures being put in place and the kind of preventative measures that are being taken by these unfortunate doctors.  Perhaps the Minister would outline to the House what procedures are being followed in the Department in regard to people involved daily with people who are at risk.  I mean people in the public services, such as prison officers, where there may be problems in relation to the perception of how contagious this disease is and how it is transmitted.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with those comments. It is in the context of being as responsible as possible in this very sensitive area that I have raised this matter and I thank you for allowing me to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of reports in the media in recent days which inferred that three doctors in this country have contracted the HIV virus.  I can neither confirm nor deny the accuracy of these reports.  I would have to accept, however, that the HIV virus does not discriminate between professions and that it is probable that a number of doctors worldwide have been infected.  There is no known case where any of these doctors has transmitted the virus to a patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>HIV anti-body testing is done in this country, as in all western countries, on a totally confidential basis.  Only the doctor dealing with any given case would know the name and, possibly, the profession of <Col N="1532" /> the person who might be infected with the HIV virus.  Such doctors would be bound by the normal ethical rules regarding patient confidentiality.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council is the body responsible for the regulation of the medical profession in this country.  It exercises its functions &mdash; which are comprehensive and wide-ranging &mdash; under the Medical Practitioner Act, 1978. These include guiding the ethical conduct and behaviour of the profession and the fitness of individual doctors to practise medicine.</P>
    <P>The council issued ethical guidelines in 1989 which include guidance to doctors who might become infected with the HIV virus.  These guidelines state, <i>inter alia,</i> that it is clearly unethical for doctors who consider that they might be infected with the HIV virus not to seek diagnostic testing. They further state that if the test is positive they should then place themselves in the care of professional colleagues for treatment and that they should also seek advice on how far it may be necessary for them to limit their professional practice in order to protect their patients, and that they should follow this advice.  They point out that doctors who have been so consulted must counsel and support the infected doctor and ensure that their advice is followed and that the doctor concerned is not a risk to patients.</P>
    <P>These ethical guidelines are in line with similar guidelines for the medical profession in all the major health systems worldwide.  I have, nevertheless, asked the Medical Council to reassess them as a matter of urgency to see if further action is required and to ensure that they are adequate to meet the trends in the disease and are non-discriminatory.</P>
    <P>While I am aware of the understandable fear which has been generated by a recent case in America about the possible transmission of the virus by a dentist to patients, this is the only known such possible case.  I would stress that this case is still under investigation by the US Authorities and by the EC Paris centre and that this country is represented on this latter body.  Any recommendations <Col N="1533" /> which would emanate from either of these two bodies following their investigation would, of course, receive very serious consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this very serious matter on the Adjournment this evening.  A major crisis is developing as regards youth homelessness, especially in our larger urban centres.  Many young people are left in a tragic cycle of persistent and intermittent homelessness because of the lack of suitable support structures.  Their needs are obviously not being met through the existing child care services.</P>
      <P>The lack of accommodation means that young people are exploited by the many desperate horrors of life on the streets. There is alcohol abuse, drug abuse and shop lifting.  Crime, and even prostitution are a means of survival for these homeless youths.  Their means of survival create further problems for the Garda and the District Courts.  We have seen several examples of this in recent months.</P>
      <P>The national survey carried out by the Streetwise National Coalition in 1987 revealed a serious problem in regard to youth homelessness in all the major cities.  Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dublin in particular lack sufficient facilities for teenage boys and girls who are homeless.  They found that 306 young people outside of Dublin were homeless while there were 406 young homeless people in Dublin.  In the time available to me tonight, I wish to point out the last major survey of the homeless was carried out in 1925.  I appeal to the Government and the Minister to carry out an in-depth analysis of the homeless at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1987 some improvements have been made.  These include the opening of a small hostel in Cork.  However, no facilities are available for teenage girls in Cork; they are referred to Edel House, an adult hostel which caters for homeless women who have experienced violence. In Galway, hostel accommodation for teenage boys at risk and out of home is <Col N="1534" /> provided at Cyrene House but, again, girls are referred to an adult hostel, Waterside House.  In Limerick, a hostel and night shelter for teenage girls at risk was established by the Good Shepherd nuns in 1989 in Clare Street.  In 1989 alone, 63 young women were accommodated in that hostel, most of whom were under 18 years of age.  However, there is no equivalent service for teenage boys who are referred by the health board to the adult men's hostel.  This is an unsatisfactory arrangement.  These incidents are repeated all over the country where teenage boys and girls are referred to adult hostels in Cork, Galway, Limerick and especially in Dublin where the problem is endemic and the position is deteriorating.</P>
    <P>Focuspoint make this case very strongly in their report which was published yesterday.  They revealed a 35 per cent increase in the use of their services for the year up to May last.  The number of young teenagers appealing for accommodation has now reached 26 a month. Sister Stanislaus Kennedy said:</P>
    <P>On average we are getting one new homeless person coming to us for help each day.  We are able to help only around 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>A shortage of services for young people and widespread unemployment are blamed for the escalating problem of youth homelessness.</P>
    <P>In their annual report for June 1990 to May 1991 Focuspoint revealed that 317 teenagers under the age of 17 sought accommodation from them; two out of three were first time callers but only one third of the young people were placed in appropriate homes and hostels.  A shortage of emergency beds meant that many more young teenagers had to go to inappropriate accommodation, such as adult hostels.</P>

      <P>The time available to the Deputy is well nigh exhausted. I would be greateful if he would bring his speech to a close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past year the Minister made various promises and <Col N="1535" /> commitments; indeed, he made commitments here in a similar debate on 17 February. He promised, for example, an after hours service for homeless children, that he would set up different units around the country, and the necessary regulations to implement the Child Care Act, especially section 5, but this has not happened.  He also promised that 65 emergency beds would be provided, but only seven have been made available.  I would like the Minister to give me a positive response tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to spell out the substantial progress which we have made during the past ten months, particularly since the Taoiseach gave me specific responsibility for the provision of child care-child centred services. I would like tonight to outline the projects which are already up and running and those which are about to commence because this is a serious issue.  As I said, I am glad to have this opportunity to respond.</P>
      <P>In recent months my Department have been working closely with all the health boards and the voluntary agencies to provide additional hostel places and other forms of accommodation so that no young person should have to sleep rough on the streets of our cities and towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important new developments which have already been approved and for which funding has been provided by the Government include a new therapeutic unit for difficult adolescents to be operated by the Eastern Health Board for which the staff have been recruited &mdash; it is expected that this centre will open late this year or early in the New Year; a new residential unit for boys and a new emergency hostel for homeless girls also in the Eastern Health Board area; a new hostel for homeless youth in the Midland Health Board area; a new residential service for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Health Board area; a new unit for children and adolescents with behavioural problems and a new facility for homeless youngsters in the NorthWestern Health Board area; the building of a new residential unit for teenage boys <Col N="1536" /> in Cork and the development of a specialised foster care programme for difficult children in the Southern Health Board area; and a new hostel for homeless girls in the Western Health Board area.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this outline that the problem of the young homeless has been targeted for priority attention.  Youth homelessness is a nationwide problem. My Department are in discussions with all the health boards concerning proposals for appropriate developments to assist the young homeless in their areas and, as can be seen from the projects I have outlined, progress has already been made in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan specifically referred to Limerick.  I wish to advise him that a new group home for eight boys at Drombanna which was delayed by local objections will open early in 1992.  With regard to Galway, the Deputy mentioned the need for a facility for girls.  Despite the fact that we have provided money, unfortunately, due to local objections, there are difficulties in obtaining a suitable premises.  Most of the facilities we are providing require planning permission from the local authority and, as the democratic process allows for objections, unfortunately from time to time delays can occur.</P>
    <P>In so far as Cork is concerned the new home at Shanakee Road for eight boys is almost complete.  Funding and staff have been provided and it will open in early 1992.  We are also making provision for the voluntary sector in Cork because as the Deputy is probably aware the voluntary sector is very much concerned.  I have taken a personal interest in working with that sector throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The provision of emergency places is, however, only one aspect of the services which need to be developed.  A balance must be struck between the provision of emergency services and other important elements which cover both short and long term accommodation and, most importantly, the strengthening of community-based support services which play a vital role in preventing young people from becoming detached from home.  Work is also being carried out in response to a variety of requests regarding the accommodation needs of young people.  In <Col N="1537" /> addition to the provision of hostel accommodation the Eastern Health Board have initiated a carers for young people scheme which caters for adolescents who have had difficulty adapting to other settings, and the board are shortly to commence the recruitment and training of four families who will take young adolescents on an emergency short term basis because those young people find it impossible to remain in the family home.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board are also in the process of developing other short term accommodation such as &ldquo;digs&rdquo;, sheltered flats and semi-independent living accommodation, in addition to special foster care and after-care programmes for travellers.  Of particular relevance to this debate is the section of the Child Care Act requiring the health boards to investigate the circumstances of homeless children and, in appropriate cases, either to receive these children into care or to take steps to make accommodation available to them.  As I stated publicly on a number of occasions, the Government are firmly committed to the phased implementation of the Child Care Act.  New regulations and rules of court are being prepared to give full effect to many of its provisions.  There will be consultations, as was promised during debate on the legislation, in the preparation of the new regulations with all those organisations on whose services and members the new regulations will have an impact. This will be done as part of a structured programme for the implementation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Indeed, as the Deputy may be aware, the first commencement order under the Act has been made.  It brought into effect from 1 December new controls relating to solvent misuse by young people.  It is now an offence for retailers or others to sell or make available any substance that he or she knows or suspects a young person will use for glue sniffing.  The penalty for this offence will be a fine of up to £1,000 and/or up to 12 months imprisonment.  Garda have also been given new powers to seize substances in the possession of young people in a public place which they believe are being abused by the young people.  The new controls and the work which is being undertaken <Col N="1538" /> by the health promotion unit of my Department in educating young people, their parents and those who work with them will help protect our young people from the hazards associated with the abuse of solvents, which is one of the problems which can lead young people to become detached from home.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have indicated here that the Government are committed to tackling the problem.  An indication of that commitment was the provision in 1991 of £1 million, targeted at the area we are discussing.  We hope to see further developments, in conjunction with the statutory agencies &mdash; mainly the health boards &mdash; and the voluntary sector, in the provision of resources and in meeting the needs as set out in the Child Care Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity of raising the issue in relation to the development within the FCA whereby, at present, a 25 per cent reduction of Permanent Defence Forces in the FCA is proposed.  This reduction will leave the FCA seriously depleted of permanent Army personnel.  In recent years there has been grave concern within the FCA about cutbacks of facilities, equipment, uniforms and so on which are available to the FCA.  The summer camps of two weeks have been reduced to one week. When one realises that there are in the region of 20,000 personnel in the FCA operating on a voluntary basis, it is a very backward step to reduce the Permanent Defence Forces attached to the FCA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now believed in certain sections of the Defence Forces that further downgrading of the FCA could lead to the abolition of this force.  Reducing the permanent staff has led to quite a lot of confusion and the lowering of morale <Col N="1539" /> within the Defence Forces.  Will the Minister say what the exact position is?  Can he assure me that the FCA will not suffer further in the present cutbacks?</P>
    <P>It has also been pointed out to me that a reduction in the Permanent Defence Forces attached to the FCA will be of no significance in financial savings.  Instead, it will result in a great deal of concern and speculation among the staff as to where their future lies.  There is no doubt that in the long term a further reduction of the permanent personnel would have a detrimental effect on morale and, obviously, on the activities of the FCA.</P>
    <P>Another issue causing concern to the members of the FCA is the failure of the Minister, so far, to recognise the Reserve Defence Forces Association.  I impress on the Minister the importance of his recognition of this association.  I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to raise this issue and I will listen with great interest to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Belton for sharing his time with me.  I have one point to make and that is that the depletion of the permanent Army personnel within the FCA would be a retrograde step.  By reducing the numbers of the Permanent Defence Forces attached to the FCA, as has been pointed out by Deputy Belton, the Government will make no major financial savings. However, one thing we can be sure of if this step is taken is that it will have a demoralising effect on the FCA who provide a service on a temporary basis.  If sufficient permanent Army personnel are not assigned to that organisation there is no way the organisation can continue to operate.  I ask the Minister to ensure that this reduction is not made in personnel numbers in the FCA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. V. Brady) Vincent Brady">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces clearly underlined the desirability of examining the whole question of the present deployment of the Defence Forces.  It is in this context that the question of the rationalisation of FCA units is being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> At present over 900 personnel of the Permanent Defence Force are assigned on a full time basis to FCA units and subunits throughout the country.  These personnel are employed in administration and training duties.  The cost of their pay and allowances in the current year is about £16 million.  The cost of the pay and allowances of Permanent Defence Force personnel employed with the FCA is substantial.  It is appropriate that this cost should be critically examined at a time when all areas of Government expenditure are subject to rigorous scrutiny.</P>
    <P>In recent months the military authorities have been engaged in an examination of the manner in which the training and administration of the FCA might be carried out on a more cost effective basis.  As part of that process 45 Permanent Defence Force officers who had been employed with the FCA on a part time basis were withdrawn from such duties with effect from 1 September 1991. Apart from these officers, no decision has been taken to transfer Permanent Defence Force staff from any particular location.  In that regard I wish to assure the House that full consideration will be given to the domestic or other difficulties that might arise for individual members of the Permanent Defence Force by being transferred from their present locations. This applies particularly in the case of non commissioned officers and privates who have been employed with the FCA for a considerable period of time.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that there will be no loss of employment for any of the Permanent Defence Force personnel at present employed with the FCA.  Any of them whom it may be decided should be transfered from their present location will fill other appointments in the Permanent Defence Force. They will also be eligible for removal expenses in accordance with Defence Force regulations.  These expenses are paid to military personnel on change of station generally on the same basis as applies to civil servants.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that the Government are committed to maintaining the FCA as an important component of the Defence Forces.  I am <Col N="1541" /> confident that the training and administration of the FCA will continue to be carried out to a satisfactory standard to enable the FCA to discharge their role. While most of these duties will continue to be performed by Permanent Defence Forces personnel, there will be a greater emphasis in further on training by FCA officers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the fact that recently the period of training has been reduced from two weeks to one week. That was done in 1983, and not recently.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to raise an important local issue.  However, let me say at the outset that I am extremely disappointed that the Minister for the Environment or the Minister of State are not present.  It begs the question whether this is merely an exercise in optics, some sort of democracy by charade.  The Minister of State had no input into the reply he will be reading.  I wonder if the points I am about to raise will be relayed to the Minister for the Environment.  Perhaps the Minister of State could address this in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public lighting in the town of Macroom is an absolute disgrace and it is high time that the Department of the <Col N="1542" /> Environment made a specific allocation of moneys available to rectify the situation. The poor lighting in the town is responsible for increasing the number of accidents in the town involving pedestrians being struck by passing cars. Poor lighting also facilitates increases in crime in the area; elderly people, in particular, living in badly lit areas are especially vulnerable.  Poor lighting has the additional impact of presenting an image of stagnation and neglect in the town when in fact the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>The town is located on the N22 national primary route and therefore the responsibility rests fairly and squarely on the Department of the Environment to provide the necessary funds for this development.  Villages east and west of Macroom &mdash; Lisarva to the east and the twin villages of Ballyvourney and Ballymakeera to the west &mdash; have had significant improvement in the provision of public lighting as a result of specific allocations from the Department of the Environment in recent years.  Macroom, the capital of the Barony of Muskerry, is certainly the poor relation.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister briefly &mdash; I had hoped that the Minister or the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment would be present &mdash; that a commitment was given to a deputation from Macroom Urban District Council which I and my constituency colleague, Deputy Kelly, joined at the Minister of State's office.  That deputation were given a commitment that these lights would be provided and the Minister agreed to provide the necessary funds in 1991.  That promise was broken.  The people of Macroom hope that the Minister will make amends in 1992.</P>

      <P>At the outset let me say that I regret that my colleague, Deputy Connolly, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, is unable to be here.  Unfortunately, he is on other business that takes him away from the House.  Though the messenger is different, I think the Deputy will find that the message is the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of traffic route lighting <Col N="1543" /> on national routes when approved by the Department of the Environment is financed in full from State road grants. Public lighting on other routes in urban areas is financed from the local authority's own resources, supplemented by the block grant for roads.  The need to upgrade the existing lighting on the national primary route through Macroom is recognised.  In order to bring the lighting up to date, consideration will be given to the possibility of having the lighting replaced in 1992 as part of the ongoing programme to replace obsolete lanterns on national routes.</P>

      <P>The N25 from Waterford to New Ross is a very important route in the south-east.  Major expenditure on this route will mean greater ease of access to the port of New Ross and to the international port of Rosslare.  There is an urgent requirement for a bridge to be provided to facilitate animals and agricultural traffic at Milltown and a pedestrian bridge to facilitate the general public at Glenmore.  Despite the public inquiry in 1984 into this project, sanction for these essential bridges in the interests of safety has not been forthcoming.</P>
      <P>The general pattern and volume of traffic has increased substantially since the public inquiry and new solutions must be found to meet the situation.  I acknowledge the Minister for the Environment's contribution of £110,000 and £100,000 for the bridges at Milltown and Glenmore respectively, but this has not met the approval of the engineers in the Department or in Kilkenny County Council from the point of view of a satisfactory design.  Kilkenny County Council have agreed to provide £50,000 from their limited resources towards one of these projects, namely, the overhead bridge to facilitate pedestrians at Glenmore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of a project costing £13 <Col N="1544" /> million I appeal to the Minister for the Environment to take a personal interest in the matter and to resolve the impasse. It is crucial not only to road users but the landowners at Milltown and the people of Glenmore to have this matter finalised once and for all because the new road is due to open shortly.  A number of resolutions, have been passed by Kilkenny County Council and a number of deputations have met the Minister.  I am now making a final appeal to bring this matter to a head because it is in the interests of safety of children, young people and landholders among others to bring about a satisfactory outcome to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of proposals for an overbridge at Milltown and a footbridge at Kill Lane, which Kilkenny County Council are seeking to provide in conjunction with the N25 Glenmore-New Ross road improvement scheme.  His Department have advised Kilkenny County Council that both proposals are acceptable in principle and that road grants will be provided to meet a portion of the cost involved in each case.</P>
      <P>In the case of the overbridge at Milltown, the grant would be limited to 50 per cent of the cost, or £110,000, whichever is the lesser.  In the case of the footbridge at Kill Lane, the grant would be limited to the lesser of 50 per cent or £100,000.</P>
      <P>On receipt of confirmation that the local authority are prepared to accept those conditions and propose to proceed with the works, the question of the allocation of the grants will be further considered.</P>
      <P>I confirm to Deputy Hogan that I will convey his views as expressed in the House tonight directly to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 13 December, 1991.</P>

      <P>In the Civil Service normal overtime arrangements are, as a general rule, applicable to officers who are conditioned to fixed weekly hours of work and whose salary maxima are equal to, or below, the salary maximum of the higher executive grade.  As there are well over 1,000 different grades in the Civil Service, I do not propose to list all of the grades which do not come within the scope of these arrangements.  I should however say that the fact that a grade does not qualify for normal overtime arrangements does not necessarily debar its members from any payment for extra attendance.  When a member of such a grade gives substantial extra attendance and cannot take time off in lieu, an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment will usually be approved.</P>

      <P>When the Deputy refers to serious exploitation of employees in the security industry, I take that he has in mind breaches of employment legislation of <Col N="1418" /> the Department of Labour.  Any breaches of this type should be referred to that Department.</P>
      <P>As regards taxation, employers in the security industry in common with all other employers are required to register with the Revenue Commissioners and must operate PAYE on all emoluments paid.  Tax deducted by an employer must be remitted to the Collector General within nine days of the end of each income tax month.  Where an employer defaults in his obligations in this regard, the Commissioners are empowered to take such enforcement action as they consider necessary.</P>
      <P>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that non-compliance with tax obligations by certain elements within the security industry has come to their notice. The special inquiry branch within the Revenue Commissioners is actively engaged in identifying firms in this and other industries which are not on the tax record.  In addition, the joint investigation units of social welfare and revenue officers set up to combat the black economy have undertaken projects in this industry and continue investigations on an ongoing basis as required.</P>
      <P>Measures to combat evasion are kept under continuous review by the Revenue Commissioners and all relevant information should be communicated to them. If the Deputy has specific information in this regard, he should refer it to the Revenue Commissioners for investigation.</P>

      <P>The total number of jobs that have been moved out of Dublin to date under the <Col N="1419" /> Government's decentralisation programme is 1,259.  As the House will be aware, the programme is now well underway and involves the eventual transfer of over 3,000 public servants to the centres already chosen.</P>
      <P>The decentralisation programme initiated in 1980 was finally launched in 1987, reflecting the Government's belief that the more widespread location of public service employment was a desirable long term objective to help reduce regional imbalances and the pressures on the Dublin region.</P>
      <P>The Government considered that for too long the concentration of human and material resources in the centre at the expense of the peripheral areas had effectively deprived the provinces of their development capacity while at the same time placing an enormous burden on the Dublin area.  The resulting migration from the provinces has been extensive and has had substantial effects on the population.</P>
      <P>While the programme will have enormous beneficial effects on the social and economic life of the areas selected, it would be difficult to quantify the effects which the decentralisation programme is having on the economy of Dublin and its citizens.  On the positive side it helps to reduce congestion and reduce pressure on office space and residential accommodation. While it may have reduced marginally total consumer expenditure in Dublin, the overall effect is likely to be more than counterbalanced by the influx of new activities such as the Financial Services Centre and by the attaction of Dublin as a tourist centre and as a regional and national shopping area.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the present programme, when completed in the 18 centres selected, will result in a better regional balance and a better regional spread of prosperity and economic activity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 53 and 66 together.  The statistical information sought by the Deputies is set out in two tables which I intend to circulate in the Official Report.  Table 1 sets out the annual data on lump sums and pension costs as well as advances made from the Central Bank.  Table 2 covers the number of posts suppressed in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The public service scheme of voluntary early retirement has operated with a number of variations since 1987.  The general scheme applied to staff serving in grades which were surplus to operational requirements and where early retirement was available without restriction of age. Posts vacated under this scheme were not filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 the early retirement provisions were made more widely available for a limited period.  The scheme was open to staff aged 50 or over in grades which were not surplus to operational requirements. <Col N="1421" /> The primary intention of this measure was to provide vacancies which could be filled by the redeployment of staff from &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; groups in the Civil Service and the wider public service.  In line with budgetary requirements it was decided that some of the posts so vacated should be suppressed.  The number of posts suppressed as a result of the scheme is set out in Table 2.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank advanced £84.9 million to the Exchequer to fund the public service early retirement scheme.  These payments were in the nature of repayable advance payments of Central Bank surplus income.  The Exchequer is therefore <Col N="1422" /> required to repay in full the advances made by the bank and this is being done by annual deductions from the normal Central Bank surplus income payable to the Exchequer.  The repayment schedule is as follows:</P>

      <P>The sites for these proposed developments were chosen after careful consideration by the Office of Public Works.  A number of possible locations was examined in each case and the Office of Public Works was satisfied that the sites chosen were the most suitable.</P>
      <P>The scope of the environmental impact studies is to access the impact of the proposed developments in accordance with the relevant EC Directive on Environment Impact Assessment as effected by the relevant statutory regulations in Ireland.  There is no requirement to carry out full studies on alternative locations. Indeed there is no requirement either to carry out an EIA on either of these developments.  Both have been undertaken voluntarily in order to allay fears expressed by members of the public in relation to the proposed developments and to afford them an opportunity of commenting on same.</P>
      <P>The environmental impact statement for the Wicklow National Park Visitor Centre has already been published and has dealt with the question of alternative sites and the criteria applied in the site selection process.  It is not necessary or particularly useful to carry out full environmental impact studies on sites which were not considered suitable.  The expense involved would be substantial.</P>
      <P>The environmental impact statement for the Burren National Park Visitor Centre will also deal with the question of consideration of alternative sites and the selection criteria applied.  A full study of any alternative site will only be carried out if the site currently being proposed is not satisfactory.</P>

      <P>There has been much public comment, and some confusion, about the national lottery company's involvement in the Pavarotti concert.  What happened was that the lottery company simply bought 1,300 tickets at £100 each which it then made available to all the people of Ireland in a free postal draw.  In addition, the company is making a contribution towards the promotional costs of the concert.</P>
      <P>The costs of this promotion will come out of the budget made available to the lottery company for marketing and promotional activities.  It is not coming out of the lottery surplus, which is used for the beneficiary spending programmes.</P>
      <P>It is important that the national lottery company maintains a high profile so as to sustain and develop &mdash; in a socially responsible way &mdash; interest in the national lottery.  The lottery company became involved in the Pavarotti concert because the event was seen as an appropriate and timely event to mark the end of the &ldquo;Dublin 1991 &mdash; City of Culture&rdquo; year.  The promotion was generally well received by the public, some 126,000 of whom took part in the draw.</P>

      <P>The next stage of the lifting of Exchange controls will take place on 1 January 1992.  This will be the penultimate stage in the liberalisation process which began in 1988.  There is a large number of <Col N="1425" /> changes which will take effect from 1 January 1992 and for convenience I have drawn up a list which I am making available to Deputies.  A detailed notice covering both the last set of changes, on 1 January and 1 June 1991, and the proposed changes has already been issued by the Central Bank on 1 November.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second part of the question, the exchange control relaxations effective from 1 January 1992 will, among other things, allow non-resident banks greater freedom to make short-term deposits in Irish pound with Irish banks.  On balance, I would expect these changes to be generally positive for Irish interest rates because they should help reduce the differentials between Irish short term interest rates and corresponding rates abroad.</P>

      <P>As a general rule overtime is resorted to in the Civil Service only where seasonal variations in the volume of work occur, <Col N="1426" /> where rostering requirements make it unavoidable, to cope with situations where the performance of urgent work is impeded by the unforeseen absence of staff or where significant travel costs would arise by having it performed in any other way.  In such circumstances the working of overtime represents the most effective and efficient means of carrying out urgent tasks.</P>
      <P>Government policy on overtime forms an integral part of our approach to the control of administrative costs in the Civil Service generally.  Since last March the vast majority of Departments and Offices have been operating delegated administrative budgets.  Under these arrangements all expenditures involved in running a Department or Office, including overtime, are combined together to form an administrative budget.  There is continuing pressure on them to ensure that their work is carried out in the most cost-effective manner, as Departments and Offices are required to achieve real annual cost reductions over the period of the budget agreement.  In those areas not covered by the administrative budgets overtime operates under restrictive controls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 51, 55 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's publication <i>Public Financial Procedures (1990),</i> refers to internal audit in the context of financial management in Departments.  It states:</P>
      <P>Internal audit is an independent appraisal within a Department which operates as a service to management and particularly to the Accounting Officer by measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of the internal control system.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present finalising detailed guidelines for internal audit which will be issued to all Departments/ Offices, including the Department of Health, which already operates a number of control procedures and where it is intended to establish a performance audit unit to assist the Minister in assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the health services.</P>
      <P>In this context I note that the Comptroller and Auditor General in his most recent annual report indicated the need for a strengthening of the internal audit function in Government Departments and Offices.  He recognised that &ldquo;the ultimate decision on the need for internal audit units where they do not already exist rests with Accounting Officers who, with the advent of administrative budgets, will have the necessary flexibility to deploy resources to the setting up of internal audit units if it is cost effective to do so&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, expenditure on the Supply Services has to be accounted for ultimately to Dáil éireann. For each Vote, an accounting officer is appointed by the Minister for Finance under section 22 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.  The <Col N="1428" /> Accounting Officer is personally responsible for the safeguarding of public funds and property under his control, for the regularity and propriety of all the transactions in each Appropriation Account bearing his signature and also for the efficiency and economy of administration in his Department.  The Accounting Officer is normally the Civil Service head of the Department or Office responsible for the Vote.</P>
    <P>Clearly an Accounting Officer cannot be expected to be familiar with the details of every financial transaction affecting his Vote, but he is expected to satisfy himself that adequate arrangements and systems exist within his Department to ensure the correctness of all payments, the bringing to account of all receipts connected with the Vote or with any fund for which his Department is responsible and the economy and efficiency of his Department's operations.  Internal audit can make an important contribution to this process.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would emphasise that internal audit is a service to the management of Departments.  The £5.8 billion referred to in the C &amp; AG's report and in the Deputies' questions is the subject of systems in Departments designed to check and verify payments and receipts.  In addition, of course, payments and receipts are audited on an ongoing basis by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Internal audit, where introduced, will concentrate primarily on examining systems and procedures and reporting to the Accounting Officer on any shortcomings identified.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether there is any merit in reviewing the 10 per cent manufacturing tax rate in an effort to stimulate employment.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 10 per cent rate for manufacturing industry was introduced in 1980, and was designed to replace the existing schemes of export sales relief and Shannon exemption.  It is a key incentive in the <Col N="1429" /> attraction of a substantial amount of mobile international investment to this country, in the provision of a very significant number of related jobs and also in assisting the expansion of domestic manufacturing companies.  This investment has led to major job creation in this country.  Over 900 overseas firms are established here, employing an estimated 90,000 people, out of our total manufacturing workforce of over 200,000.  The manufacturing sector supports an estimated further 160,000 jobs in services, subcontracting and so on.</P>
      <P>The decision to extend the life of the 10 per cent rate was undertaken following a review of the incentive.  The 10 per cent rate has been due to expire at end December 2000 and the Government provided for its extension for a further ten years in the Finance Act, 1990.  This extension enables the industrial promotion agencies to continue to attract vital overseas investment in manufacturing, in the face of ever-increasing international competition.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Government's objectives involving tax rates in general and the issue of employment are concerned, these have already been clearly set out in the revised Programme for Government. In the income tax system various reforms over recent years have been addressed at reducing the impact of tax on earnings from employment, and the Government's objectives of a 25 per cent standard rate and a single higher rate of 44 per cent are directly aimed at lowering marginal tax rates and improving the incentive to work and enterprise.  In the corporation tax system, substantial reforms since 1988 have, <i>inter alia</i>, been aimed at reducing distortions favouring the use of capital as against labour.</P>

      <P>The total cost to date to the Exchequer of the recent stock exchange flotation of Greencore plc is approximately £1.338 million of this amount:</P>
      <P>1.  £884,813 was paid in respect of underwriting, subunderwriting and brokers commissions (this represented 60 per cent of total fees/commissions which were split on a 60:40 basis between the Exchequer and the company based broadly on the amounts of money raised);</P>
      <P>2.  £308,736 was paid to the financial advisers (this included legal and accounting advice);</P>
      <P>3.  £43,454 was paid in respect of the commissions to brokers etc. on successful applications for shares (this cost was split on a 60:40 basis between the Exchequer and the company); and</P>
      <P>4.  £101,212 was paid in respect of publicity costs which were borne jointly with the company.</P>
      <P>When account is taken of increased receipts of the order of £95,000 (being interest accrued on subscription moneys) the net payment from the department of Finance Vote is roughly £1.243 million giving a saving of almost £500,000 on the Estimates allocation of £1.7 million for the flotation.  The Estimates provision was based on the standard underwriting and brokers fees and the saving of £500,000 arises from the Department's success in negotiating reduced rates of fee.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to indicate amounts paid to individual firms. However, the financial advisers and the solicitors to the Minister for Finance were J &amp; E Davy and William Fry respectively; accounting advice was from Price Waterhouse.

      <P>I presume that the Deputy has in mind the case of persons who fail to declare to Customs dutiable goods in excess of quantities they are permitted to import duty-free under the baggage allowances.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where goods are seized because of failure to declare them the Customs may offer the person concerned the option of having the goods released immediately on payment of a sum to cover the import charges due as well as a compromise element in lieu of legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>A person who does not wish to accept the terms under which Customs are willing to release the goods may appeal to the Revenue Commissioners.  However, the duty-free allowances are well publicised and travellers are expected to inform themselves as to their entitlements under those allowances or, for example, to enter the red channel at a port or airport if they are in doubt. Appeals in these cases are entertained by the Revenue Commissioners only in exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the manufacturing output index for the quarter ended August 1991, which shows an increase of less than 1 per cent in the volume of manufactured goods, and the retail sales volume index for the quarter ended July 1991, which also shows a volume increase of less than 1 per cent, are both indicators of an economy in serious trouble; and against the background of these indices; if he will outline the growth expected in GNP by the Government in 1991 and the estimated growth rate for 1992.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the manufacturing output index for the quarter ending August and the retail sales index for the quarter ending July, in each case by comparison with the same period in 1990.  On that basis the manufacturing <Col N="1434" /> output index is up by 0.9 per cent and the retail sales index shows no change.  Later figures on retail sales show that in the quarter to August, the index is down by 0.7 per cent compared with the same period of 1990.</P>
      <P>A more complete assessment of this year's performance may be obtained by comparing data for January to August with those for the same period of 1990. This shows manufacturing production up by 2.7 per cent this year, but retail sales down by 0.9 per cent.</P>
      <P>The weakness in retail sales reflects a substantial fall in sales from garages.  This segment of the retail market, here as well as in most European countries, has experienced a setback this year.  The remainder of retail sales was 2.3 per cent higher in January-August than in the same period of 1990.</P>
      <P>The two indicators show that the economy is not expanding as rapidly as last year's record performance.  However, they do not suggest an economy in &ldquo;serious trouble&rdquo;.  In fact, against a background of international weakness, the Irish economy is holding up relatively well.</P>
      <P>In relation to the expected growth in GNP in 1991, I would remind the Deputy that the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, replied to questions on this topic on 12 November last.  I do not propose to revise the assessment given then, which was for GDP growth for 1991 of 1.75 per cent and GNP growth of 1.25 per cent.</P>
      <P>I will indicate my view of growth prospects for 1992 on Budget Day.</P>

      <P>Approximately 190 projects have now been approved to operate from the International Financial Services Centre, with total new job commitments over 2,800 which are to materialise over the next four years or so.  The total number of new jobs created to date by companies approved to operate from the International Financial Services Centre is 986. Of those jobs, 345 are accounted for by Irish firms.  The balance of 641 is accounted for by foreign owned companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the information available to me, all of the 345 jobs above are completely new, that is, they are incremental employment in respect of additional activity by the Irish companies. They do not include any jobs in respect of activities which had been carried out by companies prior to their move to the centre and which, because they are international financial services, <Col N="1438" /> could qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  Care is taken in assessing every new project at the centre to ensure that such &ldquo;displacement&rdquo; does not outweigh new jobs.  However, statistics in relation to &ldquo;displaced&rdquo; jobs are not available.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, financial institutions and professional firms in the legal and accounting areas have, for their own commercial reasons, moved into the Customs House docks.  However their activities do not qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  I have no specific information on the numbers involved but it is estimated to be of the order of 700 - 800 people.</P>
    <P>The new German legislation affecting the International Financial Services Centre is still in draft form and has not yet been enacted.  Until that happens, it is not appropriate for me to speculate as to its impact on operations at the IFSC. I would say, however, that any measure that acted against investment in Ireland or the centre in particular is a cause for concern to the Government.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact (1) that the recently published preliminary results of the 1991 labour force survey, shows that the number of people at work in Ireland fell by 5,000 in the year up to April, 1991 (2) that when allowance is made for the 3,000 persons temporarily at work on the 1991 census, when the 1991 labour force survey was conducted, the underlying decline for the same period is 8,000; whether he has any evidence that this trend has not continued since April; and if he will outline the reason Government policy is failing to combat this most serious decline.</Quest>

      <P>Yes, and I am also aware that the preliminary results of the 1991 labour force survey show that employment in services and industry combined rose by 7,000 between April 1990 and April 1991.</P>
      <P>The available evidence since last April is limited, but would not imply the trend suggested by the Deputy.  CSO data show that there was an increase in manufacturing employment in the second quarter of the year as compared with the first quarter, and that employment in larger building and construction firms has been somewhat above its April level since then.  In the 11 months to end-November receipts from the employment and training levy and PAYE increased by 7 per cent and almost 8 per cent respectively, as compared with the same period in 1990.  While factors other than employment influence the trend of these receipts, the trend nevertheless supports the view that employment has been holding up well this year.</P>
      <P>The 1991 labour force survey results do not indicate any failure of Government economic policy.  Instead, they show that employment in the non-agricultural private sector rose marginally despite the extremely difficult international situation, reflecting the competitiveness of the economy.  This competitive strength is a direct result of this Government's and its predecessor's economic policies. These policies have enhanced the potential of the economy to generate employment, a potential which is clearly shown by the increase of 36,000 in total employment between April 1989 and April 1990.</P>

This reform is to be funded by a systematic curtailment of exemptions, shelters, allowances and concessionary tax rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The data on public service numbers and associated pay costs requested by the Deputy is detailed in the two tables which I am circulating with this reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Civil Service the very tight restrictions on recruitment in the 1987-89 period were followed by some limited recruitment and later by the greater <Col N="1447" /> flexibility to recruit within the limits of the new administrative budget arrangements. The former narrow focus on the direct control of Civil Service numbers as an instrument of public expenditure control has thus been subsumed within a more broadly based system for the control of Departmental administration costs generally.</P>
    <P>Departments are now free to determine staffing complements up to and including HEO level and equivalents. Higher appointments still require Finance sanction.  Thus a Department can now vary the numbers in most grades in the interests of greater efficiency and effectiveness, without specific Finance sanction, provided, of course, that they <Col N="1448" /> do not exceed the overall cash limits set out in the administrative budgets.  In all cases, whether within the administrative budget delegated arrangements or dealt with by my Department, posts should be filled only where they are deemed essential having regard to the difficult overall budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>As regards numbers policy in the wider public service, the 1991 Budget Speech emphasised the Government's ongoing determination that consolidation of the reduction in staff numbers achieved since 1987 (and detailed in Table 1) would go on.  Consequently no general resumption in public service recruitment has been allowed, although limited recruitment has taken place in areas of particular need since 1989, such as the Garda and the health service.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the comments by the EC Court of Auditors in their annual report were made as part of general comments on payment methods by a number of EC member states, including Ireland.</P>
      <P>The comments made in the 1990 report refer to the year 1988.  In so far as Ireland is concerned the comments must be seen in the context of the amnesty which occurred in that year and which necessitated the processing of an extraordinary number of additional payments for all taxes (including VAT) by the Collector-General's Office.</P>
      <P>I understand that the present position is that the Collector-General lodges to the Exchequer in excess of 80 per cent of money received within twenty-four hours of receipt and that practically all payments are in the Exchequer by the third day after receipt.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the Collector-General's Office is not slow to cash cheques and that the Exchequer does not suffer a loss because of existing procedures.</P>

      <P>I am fully satisfied that the creation of the National Treasury Management Agency has been a worthwhile initiative.  The agency was established to bring increased specialisation to the Exchequer borrowing and debt management operations, so as to ensure that debt service costs were kept as low as possible.  I am satisfied that the agency are achieving this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1991 budget included a target of £40 million for savings by the agency on debt service costs this year.  This target will be achieved.  In addition to debt management savings made by the agency the debt service outturn figure will include savings arising from lower interest rates. Details of the final outturn for debt service costs will be given in the end-year statement of Exchequer receipts and expenditure.  It is impossible to make a comparison between the performance of <Col N="1451" /> the agency and how the Department of Finance might have performed the borrowing and debt management functions if the agency had not been established.</P>

      <P>A proposal for a Council directive on the Conservation of Natural and Semi-natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora more generally known as the &ldquo;Habitat Directive&rdquo; has been under discussion for some time but has not yet been agreed by the council of Ministers.  The purpose of this draft directive is to conserve habitats and species of European significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Community network of special areas of conservation, to be known as <Col N="1452" /> NATURA 2000, will be set up with each member state contributing to its creation. A list of areas to be classified is to be submitted by the member states to the Commission, who will then, in consultation with member states and a special committee, decide on the areas of Community importance.  These sites will then be designated as special conservation areas.</P>
    <P>The list of areas to be classified will be selected on the basis of their European status, i.e., habitats which are in danger of disappearance in the European Community and habitats of species which are endangered in the European community. Where Ireland has large areas of such habitats, for example, blanket bogs, the best sites would be selected.  Sites may be selected in any part of the country but it is not possible to say at this stage what area of land would be involved.</P>
    <P>In special areas of conservation, member states will be required to take measures to avoid deterioration of habitats and, where development is proposed, to take account of the impact on the conservation status of the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1987, this Government and its predecessor have formulated and <Col N="1453" /> implemented a set of consistent, pro-employment, economic policies embracing fiscal responsibility, exchange stability and international competitiveness in particular.  Those policies have been shown to be successful, most recently by the Labour Force Survey results published last October.  That survey indicates continuing growth in employment outside agriculture and, more particularly, in the non-agricultural private sector. Even in the face of current unfavourable international developments, other indicators suggest that employment continues to hold up well.  The Government have, of course, also secured major expansion in the Community's Structural Funds, which is being used to strengthen further the competitive ability of Irish producers on international markets, and will underpin employment growth in the years ahead.  In addition, the Government intend to establish an employment and training programme for persons on the live register for at least two months which will largely be financed from structural funds.  The aim of this programme is to provide up to 10,000 places in training and up to 15,000 places in employment in the private sector in 1992.</P>
      <P>While I will always remain open to any soundly-based proposals which offer the prospect of enhancing growth of self-sustaining, lasting employment the policies which this Government have been and are pursuing represent the best primary strategy for job creation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has also sought my views on an interventionist common, i.e. Community) industrial policy.  This is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As he has indicated to you in response to a previous question, a common approach to EC industrial policy was agreed at Community level in November 1990 through the creation of open competitive markets and by measures to promote a favourable economic environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Maastricht Summit, the member states agreed an amendment to the Treaty which commits the Community to ensuring the conditions necessary for competitiveness in industry, with <Col N="1454" /> the overriding consideration that these measures do not bring about distortions in competition.  Of course, the Summit also agreed a number of measures to promote economic and social cohesion.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline (1) the estimate of GNP growth for 1992 which has been provided to his Department by the Central Bank (2) the minimum percentage growth in the economy which is now estimated to be required to produce 25,000 new jobs on an annual basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Central Bank's growth forecast for 1992 was published recently in its Winter Bulletin and is, therefore, on the public record.  The bank forecasts that GNP will grow by 2 per cent next year.</P>
      <P>There is no unique growth rate associated with any given rate of net employment growth.  There are several reasons for this including (a) the sectoral distribution of economic growth and (b) the nature of employment growth, in particular the contribution of part-time employment to that growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of Government policy is to maximise the growth potential of the economy and to increase the employment intensity of growth.  This Government, through its prudent fiscal and monetary policies, have achieved a low level of inflation and internationally competitive interest rates &mdash; essential requirements for sustainable growth.  The sensible incomes policies which have been pursued have helped to improve our competitive position, thereby contributing to growth and employment.  The increase in total employment of 36,000 in the 12 months to April 1990 clearly illustrates the employment growth potential of the economy resulting from these sound policies. Even this year, with economic growth low because of adverse international conditions, a range of indicators <Col N="1456" /> clearly supports the view that employment is holding up well in the non-agricultural sector.</P>

These arrangements apply to central fund transactions, which are a matter for the Department of Finance and the National Treasury Management Agency, and to State revenues which are entrusted to the accounting officers of other Departments.  All accounting officers on being appointed are made aware of the correct accounting procedures to be followed in regard to these revenues.

Since then it has been Garda policy not to issue firearm certificates in respect <Col N="1464" /> of such weapons.
