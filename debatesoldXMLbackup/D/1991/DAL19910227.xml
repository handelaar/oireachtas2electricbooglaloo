      <P>Before we come to the Order of Business I have received a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  I now call on Deputy Jim O'Keeffe to state the matter of which he has given notice.</P>

      <P>I move the Adjournment of the Dáil pursuant to Standing Order 30 on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration.  The matter in question is the need for the Dáil: 1.  To congratulate the people of Kuwait on the liberation of their country and to call on Iraq to formally withdraw all claims of any kind to the territory of Kuwait; 2.  To confirm that Iraq must comply fully and unconditionally with all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council arising from its invasion of Kuwait; 3. To demand that Saddam Hussein now confirm his willingness to accept and comply with such Resolutions of the United Nations.</P>

      <P>It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that: (1) Business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m.; (2) the proceedings on Committee Stage of No. 13 and No. 14 and Committee and remaining Stages of No. 15, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m., 7 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. respectively, by one question in each case which shall be put from the Chair, and which shall in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the member of the Government in charge of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In relation to this item, The Workers' Party Whip has indicated to all the other parties in the House that we are not satisfied to have a guillotine particularly having regard to such a short period of time given to item No. 13, the Radiological Protection Bill.  There have been 68 amendments in all to this Bill and only about 14 have been dealt with.  We believe it is important that more time be given to deal with the remaining amendments.  We are, therefore, proposing an amendment to the Order of <Col N="1739" /> Business to allow the debate on Committee Stage to continue to 7 p.m. tonight.  I, therefore, propose that items Nos. 14 and 15 be deleted from paragraph (2) of the Order of Business and that the guillotine on No. 13 be extended to 7 p.m. tonight.</P>

A sizeable body of opinion in the medical field believes that tradition is used excessively in certain treatments.  In view of the fact that nothing has happened in the interim to change our minds we ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  I am anxious to make progress and reach the substantive parts of the Bill so I will not go over the debate which has already taken place on this amendment.

To return again to the points raised by the Deputies in relation to section 7 (2), I want to re-emphasise that I deem it essential to clarify and set down the limits of the intervention of the new institute in medical and dental diagnosis or treatment of patients in full recognition of the role of the medical or dental practitioner in the case of his or her patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exposure of patients to radiation is a matter for the judgment of the doctor or dentist concerned.  While this has been <Col N="1746" /> their traditional prerogative they may, of course, seek advice and guidance wherever or whenever they wish.  Recognition of this traditional practice has been reflected in legislation.  Therefore, it is obvious that we are not introducing anything new in section 7 (2) but are simply carrying on traditional policy and maintaining the <i>status quo</i> in relation to the use of radiation in medicine and dentistry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton stated in our previous discussions that there is respectable medical opinion that radiation is used excessively in diagnosis and treatment.  If such is the case &mdash; and there is not a scintilla of evidence to indicate that it is &mdash; surely it is a matter for the Minister for Health and the medical and dental councils to deal with it as they would any other case of alleged malpractice, misbehaviour or incompetence.  Hospital management would, one would imagine, be expected to curtail such practices and be, even from an economic viewpoint, very concerned at any inefficient or wasteful practices.  The same respectful medical opinion must surely be aware of the proper course of action for it to take if it is aware of abuses in this area, that is, to inform the appropriate hospital management body or employing agency.</P>
    <P>Disability benefit claims and medical negligence cases involving many consultations and apparent duplication of exposures was referred to by Deputy Higgins. He said there is a considerable amount of laxity in regard to exposure. These are matters for referral to the medical authorities.  It would not be proper that the institute should involve themselves in such issues.  Granted they may have medical personnel on their board but they will not be, strictly speaking, a medical unit as such.  If they were, it is the Minister for Health who should be here now and not me.</P>
    <P>To further allay any fears Deputies might have in this area, I would point out that the Nuclear Energy Board have established, with the Department of Health, a medical advisory committee with the function of providing advice on <Col N="1747" /> the medical uses of radiation.  This committee consist of experts in the medical field and in radiation protection.  This work will, of course, continue when the new institute is established.  From the reasons I have given on the previous occasion we discussed this matter and from my contribution this morning, it should be clear that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of the existence of this committee.  Perhaps a development of their role might meet some of the issues raised.  The Minister suggested that he was simply maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  If the <i>status quo</i> was adequate we could all pack our bags and go but since we are always trying to improve the <i>status quo</i>, there is no justification for the Minister's response.  We believe a restriction is being introduced here but the Minister said he is simply recognising the <i>status quo.</i></P>
      <P>In relation to the use of radiation in the treatment of patients, we are talking about utilising very specialised techniques, and I am not sure the average patient or their families would easily be able to assess or evaluate the necessary dosage and so on.  I continue to believe that the institute could have a role protecting patients and examining this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from other areas &mdash; I am not necessarily talking about negligence &mdash; that practices can develop which become regular practice without being examined unless they become the subject of specialised studies.  There are particular treatments in maternity cases which have come into serious question, for example, minor operations on women giving birth which were entirely unnecessary, and when examined closely the level of such procedures was reduced substantially. That is an area that is easier for the average person to assess.  Here we are talking about a very specialised area which would be more difficult for the patient or their representative to evaluate and question and to take the action that would be open to them in other areas. The institute could have a greater role in <Col N="1748" /> this area.  The committee to which the Minister referred, if developed and strengthened, could take a greater interest in this area and answer some of the questions that have been raised in the medical profession.  Perhaps they should be asked to turn their minds to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained on a previous occasion, a number of the practices to which we are referring here involve the traditional doctor-patient relationship.  I made it clear in my contribution the last day we discussed this Bill that is it important we should not seek to interfere with the doctor's role in diagnosing and recommending certain types of treatment for his patient.  It would not be the institute's role to interfere in the level or type of treatment to be administered to any patient.  The medical committee is sufficient to enable the medical profession to seek advice in relation to dosages and so on if and when that is required.  I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 15 in the name of Deputy Richard Bruton.  I observe that amendment No. 16 is cognate and I suggest, therefore, that we discuss amendments Nos. 15 and 16 together.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 9, paragraph (f), line 23, <Col N="1749" /> after &ldquo;bodies&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and at a minimum observe standards laid down in EC Directives&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is very simple, namely, to bring some sort of concrete level of standard into this legislation. We are asking the institute to issue codes of practice, to establish safety guidelines and to take into account relevant international views on these matters. There is a need to strengthen that and at a very minimum to lay down that we will be observing standards recommended in EC Directives.  There is a history in this area in that we have often been tardy to move in line with EC Directives. I know that in the area of emergency planning to deal with radiological problems, Ireland was one of the countries that were particularly slow to move on proposals promulgated by the EC in the early eighties, long before Chernobyl brought public attention to the need to deal with this.  There is a case to be made that we put into legislation a requirement that certain minima be met and that we take on board the EC Directives and recommendations as the minimum standard and that hopefully we will exceed those standards in areas where Irish interests require it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In opposing this amendment and the following amendment I would like to emphasise that section 8 (f) and (g) already requires the institute to take into account standards recommended by relevant international bodies, which would, of course, include EC standards as set out in directives.  Furthermore I consider it inappropriate to refer specifically to European Community Directives for minimum standards because in many instances, and indeed in other areas of activity, we in Ireland maintain higher standards than those in EC Directives.  Therefore, I see no need for this amendment because the point has already been covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to have read what the amendment suggests.  First, it states quite clearly that <Col N="1750" /> these would be minimum standards.  I was not suggesting that where we have better standards we reduce them to EC levels. I was proposing a base beneath which we would not sink.  The other point is that while the clause as it stands states that you should take into account the standards set down, what I am seeking to do is insert that, at a minimum, we would observe these standards.  I do not think the Minister in his short speech addressing this amendment has answered either of the questions raised by the amendment, namely, that there would be a minimum standard required by the institute and that the minimum would be set from EC levels.  They would not become the maximum as the Minister seems to think is implied in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to support the Minister's point of view and perhaps Deputy Bruton will comment on what I have to say.  We are told that Sellafield is operated in accordance with the minimum standards of the EC Directives, at least that is the argument which the British Government use.  If that is so, clearly those minimum requirements are not adequate as far as this country is concerned.  We should aim for much higher standards than the minimum requirements of EC Directives which are not adequate to protect this country from places like Sellafield.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments tabled by Deputy Bruton.  In any other legislation I have dealt with I do not recollect coming across the phrase &ldquo;take into account&rdquo;.  What does it mean? Does it mean to examine and reject them or to adopt and accept them?  What legal status has the phrase?  It seems a very weak phrase.  It does not seem that it requires you to enforce EC or any other international directives.  Substantial improvements have been made to this Bill and it is quite clear that it was framed in the most conservative way possible by persons whose thinking was directed more towards the industry and its area of responsibility instead of towards the protection of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> One of the fundamental problems of this Bill is that it should have been part of the general protection Bill.  I cannot claim to have been involved in huge bodies of legislation, but I have followed legislation which set up various institutes and organisations and I have yet to come across &ldquo;take into account&rdquo;.  To clarify the matter, Deputy Bruton suggested that we should have &ldquo;at least a minimum&rdquo; and that EC Directives should be the minimum. What standards have we set in the Bill?  It is vague and imprecise and Deputy Bruton's proposals strengthen it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton's amendment which basically states that our guidelines should be those recommended by the EC and that they should be the minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should bear in mind that, in establishing the institute, we do not want to place restrictions on them in exercising their own judgment in relation to the level of guidelines they should recommend and propose.</P>
      <P>If I accepted Deputy Bruton's amendment it would be seen as accepting the EC levels and placing a restriction on the institute in relation to the levels of standards they should apply.  There is an implication in the amendment that we should aspire to EC levels at all times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be seen as implying that.  It is not appropriate, in legislation of this kind, to single out specifically any one international body's set of recommendations.  The institute should be free to carefully examine the recommendations of all the international organisations and to come to their own decision in the matter.  It is unnecessarily restrictive to suggest that we should <Col N="1752" /> adopt as the minimum the standards recommended by the European Community. There is a much wider corpus of knowledge available with which, I hope, the institute will acquaint themselves and draw their information from before arriving at their decision.  I have every faith and confidence in the institute adopting what they felt to be the best standards for Ireland which, as I have already indicated, in many cases exceed the standards proposed by the European Community.</P>
      <P>When the minimum is suggested, there is a possibility of that becoming the norm and it would remove from the members of the institute the necessity to continue to carefully examine what all the international bodies recommend in regard to standards.  If it was specifically mentioned in the Bill that they must comply with at least the EC standards, they could just do that whereas we might like to see much higher standards applied.  That would also be the case in relation to other international bodies and we know that the Community, in arriving at its decisions, has received representations from a wide number of countries and interests.  The Community's recommendations need not necessarily be the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Ian McAuley, the expert from Trinity College in this area, is in favour of amendments of this nature to strengthen the Bill.  There seems to be a misplaced self-congratulatory attitude on the part of the Minister, as if Ireland was somehow a paragon of virtue in this area.  He had to admit that the Nuclear Energy Board, in their report on the way in which we dispose of radioactive waste generated, said that 99 per cent goes into the public sewers and that some institutions which store radioactive waste do so in conditions which the board regard as unsuitable in the long term. They did not want to cause panic or to create a major public worry in this regard, but it is quite clear that they did not see this as the long term way to deal with our problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not legislating for Britain, we are legislating for what we will do and it <Col N="1753" /> is incumbent on us to set standards for those who will be handling radioactive waste in this country.  I should like to see a minimum put on this because we have known for a long time that the disposal of our own radioactive waste is defective in many ways.  Indeed, there is a lot of hypocrisy in the way in which we talk about handling radioactive waste.  There is a need to have something of this nature and the Minister should reconsider his position.  Perhaps, on Report Stage, he will look at the matter again after he has consulted more widely than he has to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is the use of the term &ldquo;international standards&rdquo; because, throughout most developed countries, the use of nuclear energy and nuclear power is widespread.  Consequently, there is bound to be pressure from vested interests which influence the setting of standards.  Luckily, we are not in that position in this country and there are not any internal pressures of that kind where large commercial undertakings are dependent on the use of nuclear energy and nuclear power.</P>
      <P>I should prefer to see the institute here completely free to set their own standards and I hope they will be much higher than those set by international bodies which, as I said, must be influenced by the widespread use of nuclear energy within their own areas of responsibility.  The section should be strengthened to make it quite clear that this House will look for nothing less than the highest standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to let us know if his reluctance to accept the amendment is a way of avoiding obligations we would inherit or take upon ourselves as a result of having to abide by EC Directives.  As somebody who, before going into politics, worked in this area and worked with nuclear and radioactive isotopes, I am aware of problems hospitals and educational institutes have because of the total lack of guidelines and nuclear and chemical waste disposal policies.  The most recent answer we got from the Government in relation to the <Col N="1754" /> disposal of waste was to take it up to Du Pont in Derry.  As one who visited Sellafield and questioned them closely about their activities there, I saw they had a very easy way out.  They said, &ldquo;We will take you down the road and show you the dump where we are disposing of your nuclear waste for you&rdquo;.  Is the Minister's reluctance to accept the amendment a way out of taking on obligations we should be taking on and are avoiding because our way of dealing with problems like this is to get somebody else to dispose of it?  Are we still dependent on British Nuclear Fuels to dispose of some of our nuclear waste?  Surely that would be in contravention of EC Directives. Is the Minister in the process of putting together some policy in relation to disposal of our waste ourselves without having to be dependent on Britain?  Our dependency compromises us in any stand we could take against Britain in relation to places like Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment is clear and unambiguous.  It does not state that we should accept EC standards but that we should accept EC standards as a bare minimum.  Our standards may be far more strict.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Without the amendment the section as drafted is so vague that the Minister is committing us to no standards at all.  I did not get a reply to the point about what legal standing &ldquo;take into account&rdquo; has.  That phrase could mean look at, accept, reject, take bits, take nothing, and the Minister could say we did take them into account.  The Bill as drafted fudges the issue of a commitment to any standard and leaves the agency entirely free to adopt whatever guidelines they may choose at any time with no direction from this House.  If that is the purpose I do not know why we are bothering to come in here and to debate the Bill at all.  We are very concerned that there be some clear direction, some clear intention, to minimum international standards and &ldquo;take into account&rdquo; does not achieve that.  Perhaps <Col N="1755" /> the Minister will consider a tighter drafting of that section on Report Stage to meet some of our points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Allen, we have already dealt with the question of waste disposal in an earlier section when I informed the House that the waste management services of the International Atomic Energy Agency will be visiting Ireland in July in relation to proposals for the identification of a suitable site for toxic waste disposal here.  That matter is under consideration but no great progress can be made in the matter until we get their recommendations.  I have already given full details of that to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a cop-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to say it is a cop-out.  In fact, it is the proper way to progress the matter because they are the international experts.  They are the people best qualified to advise this country on how to handle the very issue the Deputy has raised which, as he knows, has been an issue in this country for many years and about which nothing has been done to date, that is identifying the site and proceeding with the establishment of the facility.  We hope some steps will be taken following the advice of this group, who are very specialist.  Because of the amount of work they have they were not available to come to the country immediately when they were sought and we still have to wait a few months before they can come to do the intensive type of research that is necessary.  It is hoped that then the results of their work will help us to make progress in the areas of concern to me and all other parties in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me also allay the Deputy's fears, if they are genuine, that the reluctance on my part to accept the amendment is an indication of the Government's and the future institute's unwillingness to adopt the highest possible standards.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  From all we have done to try to make this institute as independent as possible it must be clear that they themselves have great <Col N="1756" /> discretion in deciding matters of this nature.  I expect the persons who will be appointed will carry out their duties diligently and will lay down the very best of standards for us.</P>
    <P>The difficulty I have with the amendment is that it picks out the EC as if the EC was the world authority on all the various issues that will have to be decided and on which guidelines will have to be made.  There are many other international bodies, many of them far ahead of the EC in making recommendations on the most modern standards required in relation to radiation.  In some cases the EC is behind in adopting these higher standards, yet if I accept this amendment it is tantamount to declaring that we in this country are prepared to accept whatever levels the EC decides, which in many cases are not the state of the art in relation to safety precautions in radiation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not try to be too cynical.  We are working together here to try to make this institute an effecive body and I have deliberately pulled them out from under the influence of the Department &mdash; if the Deputies are prepared to concede that &mdash; in the amendments I have put forward.  The International Commission on Radiological Protection, for instance, have recently set out higher standards than those currently in force in the EC Directives.  While these will probably be adopted by the EC, it will take some time to transfer them to EC legislation.  If I am to accept the suggestion in this amendment it means we will be quite happy here to wait until the standards are adopted in EC legislation.  At that stage maybe the international commission will have some new discovery and upgraded its guidelines.  I think it would be very restrictive to put in an amendment such as this.  I have every faith in those who will be appointed carrying out their duties diligently and the Bill as written places an obligation on the institute to take into account all the <Col N="1757" /> relevant standards that are being recommended by the various international bodies.  I think that puts a serious obligation on them to be acquainted with developments in all the international bodies and to seek to incorporate into the guidelines and recommendations they are issuing the most modern recommendations in regard to safety in this area</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all be perfectly happy if compliance with the international agency's recommendations was written into this Bill.  I think the Minister is cleverly skirting around this.  I am concerned that what we are left with in this is absolutely no standard at all, a general aspiration, but this is legislation.  If we are to seek through the law to challenge the Minister or the institute in relation to the performance of their functions under this section because EC standards are not complied with, all they have to say is that they took them into consideration and that they were inappropriate to the Irish situation.  This is loose and imprecise and I am concerned about that description. The section as drafted is open to interpretation and applies a general but not a specific obligation.  In what way does this protect the public or ensure that any standard is applied?  It would depend on the goodwill and talent of individual members at the time.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister do what he did in relation to the debate on &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; and rather than accepting the amendment make a statement? The Minister has been quite co-operative so far in this Bill and he intends to observe the best standards.  In the case of &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; the Minister made a statement to the effect that &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; as already in the text and covered the concept of &ldquo;nuclear explosive device&rdquo;.  What the Minister says on Committee Stage of a Bill is almost as important as the Bill if court proceedings arise. Will the Minister say that the section covers acceptance of EC Directives?  I take it that the Minister's intention is that the institute's standards if possible, will be above the standards set by the EC <Col N="1758" /> Directives.  Will the Minister confirm that &ldquo;standards recommended by international bodies&rdquo; covers acceptance of EC standards and that that will resolve the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that the Minister is aspiring to the highest standards possible when we do not have any standards at the moment.  Surely the acceptance of the amendment would not prevent the Minister from aspiring to the highest standards possible.  The amendment suggests that we should adhere to EC Directives as a minimum.  It does not prevent the Minister from doing what he wants. It is ludicrous to have a Minister here aspiring to the highest possible standards and saying that we are waiting for reports and for international bodies to visit here while at the moment we do not have any standards.  At the moment, hospitals, for instance, have spent nuclear devices and they do not have an idea what to do with them.  The Nuclear Energy Board know that.  We do not have a waste management system, admittedly we never had, but the situation is becoming more serious day by day.  The Minister knows the standards and if his Department and his officials had the guts they would make hard decisions.</P>
      <P>We had an example recently of another cop-out when we were in the process of setting up a chemical treatment plant. Suddenly the easy option of exporting it to Du Pont was taken &mdash; an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  The Department should knuckle down to setting standards and not delay the process by saying that we are waiting for an international body to come here.  That does not cod anybody. The problem should be tackled. Instead of aspiring, the Minister should at least set minimum standards.</P>

I suspect that even the EC standards with an input from these countries which have been creating a nuclear waste dump in the seas off this country for many years are not strict enough.  Our guidelines should come from a much wider area than EC Directives about which I have grave suspicion because of experience relating to a number of prominent EC countries.</P>

      <P>One of the biggest offenders in dumping nuclear waste, the people with the biggest problems, are the Japanese who are dependent on British Nuclear Fuels and their nuclear regeneration operations to take care of their spent fuels.  I do not understand the previous speaker's argument.  We are just taking EC standards as a minimun.  This frees the Minister to do what he wants subsequently.</P>

      <P>There may be some confusion in relation to the guidelines and the code of practice and directives.  What we are discussing under this amendment <Col N="1760" /> is the guidelines and code of practice which are being prepared and will be issued by the institute when it exists.  The House knows that the implementation of EC Directives is a separate matter.  We are required to implement these directives in national legislation.  The guidelines and code of practice will be designed to assist users in implementing the requirements of EC Directives as reflected in legislation.  What the Deputies are suggesting in the amendment is that in complying with EC Directives and in introducing the guidelines and code of practice we should take account of EC standards as a minimum.  There is no need to put a clause of that nature into the legislation.  The institute will take account of the current recommendations from a wider range of international bodies than just one.  In complying with EC Directives it could in its code of practice be implementing a higher standard, as I believe will be the case.  It has been the practice that it has sought to achieve the highest standards possible here.  For instance, under Statutory Instrument 166 of 1977, licences issued by the Nuclear Energy Board set standards which are higher than those currently contained in the EC Directive setting down basic safety standards.</P>
      <P>My opposition to the amendment is based on my desire to remove the restrictive elements contained in it and to encourage the institute to seek to contain in its code of practice the highest possible standards known to international organisations who are studying these matters, rather than to encourage them to stick to the minimum standards that may have been adopted by an EC Directive. In 1977 we introduced higher standards than the current EC Directive standards in one instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we will get any good of the Minister.  We should lay down some minimum standard in legislation.  If the Minister is not satisfied with the EC Directive I am quite happy to see him substitute that our minimum shall be that laid down by the Commission on Radiological Protection, <Col N="1761" /> which he rightly said is often at the cutting edge of setting standards.  If he wishes to substitute that, I will accept it, but we need some minimum standard.  His quotation that directives from the EC apply here is belied by the reality.  For example, the EC have a directive stating that cities the size of Dublin should have tertiary sewerage treatment plants, but that does not mean we have one in Dublin.  The same would apply in other areas.  There is a need to set some minimum standard in this.  By all means let the Minister say to us now he will consider coming back on Report Stage with his set of better standards from the International Commission on Radiological Protection, which he will seek to put into this Bill.</P>

      <P>It will be enormously expensive but the Government have made a commitment to it.  To mention it in that vein seems to suggest that the Government are totally ignoring it.  They are not.  It takes time to implement some <Col N="1762" /> of these directives which require enormous capital expenditure.  However the commitment in that area is made.</P>
      <P>I am fully satisfied with the terms of the section in the Bill as it is worded and I do not understand why the Deputies should express such concern.  There is a serious obligation on the institute to take into account the relevant standards recommended by relevant international bodies and it is open to any Member in the House, if he is aware that this is not being done during the life of the institute, to bring the matter to the notice of the relevant Minister or the authorities at the institute.  I certainly would have a much more optimistic outlook on the quality of the work of the proposed institute than the Deputy would seem to have.  I would encourage the institute to seek the highest standards and not to be satisfied with the minimum standards.</P>

    <P>I think we can be very brief on this because the Minister's amendments, between what he has tabled here and his later amendments to section 30, as I read them have met the intention of my amendment.  If the Minister's amendments go ahead, I am satisfied to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the amendment which I will be proposing in relation to section 30, I propose to amend this paragraph.  I propose to delete from section 30 the option to enable the Minister to issue licences for radio-active substances thereby providing that the institute will be the licensing authority in any control system introduced by the Minister by order under section 30.  The idea that the institute would be an agent of the Minister in the issuing of licences is not in keeping with my intention that the institute would be an independent regulatory body.  I therefore propose to delete the words, &ldquo;as agent of the Minister&rdquo; and the two commas in line 36.</P>

      <P>I know that we should not be discussing waste disposal or anything like that on section 8 because it is very specific.  Nevertheless the whole issue of disposal should come into the preparing and issuing of codes of practice dealing with radiological safety etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not so much where a disposal unit is but what in fact happens.  Deputy Allen made some points which have been brought to my attention over the past year or two.  Deputy Allen probably has <Col N="1767" /> more exact information on what happens. He referred to hospitals.  There are very few codes of practice for dealing with very minute amounts of radioactive materials that might be lying around.  This occurs in universities as well.  It was brought to my attention by students in universities over a year ago, and not too long ago as well, that there is nobody in charge in these institutions to tell people what they should do.  It is left to the lecturer or professor in the particular laboratory to try to get rid of these waste materials in whatever way they can.  In some cases students actually dispose of materials.  They are probably very tiny and minute.  Nevertheless there is not, apparently, a procedure for having an individual responsible for ensuring that everybody who uses any radiation equipment or devices can dispose of waste materials.  There is nobody to supervise how it is collected or disposed of.  I have been told that some material from universities has been disposed of in playing pitches by being buried and by other procedures like that.  Maybe there is nothing to worry about.  Maybe it is all quite safe.  We do not know.</P>
    <P>I read the section but I am not sure whether this is covered.  Presumably these codes of practice and guidelines are to ensure that there is a procedure whereby somebody is in charge at all times of the waste materials whether in hospitals or universities.  The institute should be informed of what materials are there and there should be very strict guidelines on how and where the materials aee disposed of.  I hope the codes of practice and the guidelines will cover all of these matters which Deputy Allen referred to and which have been brought to my attention and which probably happen in a whole series of areas other than universities and hospitals that I am not aware of.  I know they are only minute quantities but when they are all put together there is probably a significant quantity to be disposed of.  I would like some confirmation from the Minister that this will be one of the areas the institute will be very strict on, that <Col N="1768" /> there will be an insistence that safety officers will be available to be in charge of the disposal and that it is not left to whoever happens to be using it to try to get rid of it wherever they can either down the drain or into a football pitch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In case my name might be associated with what has just been said, I am aware of the problems facing hospitals and educational institutions in this regard.  I do not think for a moment that nuclear waste is being dumped in football pitches or down drains.  I know for a fact that in respect of the institutions concerned, we are talking of low level radioactive waste in most cases.  There are safety officers in those institutions and there are regulations, guidelines and procedures that are followed very strictly in all the institutions that I am aware of. Once the nuclear waste is collected there is a problem in disposing of it.  On tomorrow's Order Paper there will be a question from myself to the Minister about storing radioactive generators in hospitals. The dumping in football pitches or in drains of low level radioactive waste may have happened many years ago but now there are strict guidelines in all institutes &mdash; they are being responsible but they are being frustrated by the lack of policy.  I am not trying to criticise the Minister but there has been a lack of policy from day one at national level.  The issue we have to face is the formulation of policy regarding storage or disposal and until such time as we do there will be suspicion and statements such as we have just heard.  I have to defend the hospitals and the institutions and the board &mdash; for once.  I have been critical of the board before but they are working as best they can under the present legislation.  In the absence of a policy regarding disposal there is a huge frustration factor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Allen has said.  It is important that we quash any suggestion that there is some laxity in the way in which the low level waste is being disposed of in this country. The Nuclear Energy Board exercise very strict control on the disposal of radioactive <Col N="1769" /> waste.  Indeed, we had a very extensive discussion on this aspect of the Bill on 5 December last.  I do not want to go back over all that was said, it is already there on the record, other than to say that in issuing licences for the use of radioactive substances, licencees are required &mdash; as Deputy Allen has rightly said &mdash; to appoint radiation safety officers.  Within that institution they control the procedures in relation to the disposal of waste. We know from previous discussions and from the previous opportunity we had to discuss this matter here the wide level of concern about the absence of a radio-active waste disposal site in this country. I have already indicated the steps we are taking to try to identify a suitable site and to take the steps necessary to establish one.  The International Atomic Energy Agency will be advising us on that matter when their experts come here in July. The situation at present is that the hospitals and laboratories dispose of low level radioactive waste by storing it on site and dispose of high level radioactive elements by returning them to the supplier. We have recognised the need to have a disposal site here and I am anxious to progress it as quickly as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this subsection the Minister may assign by order to the institute the function of making arrangements for the supply of radioactive substances or devices to users in Ireland and the implementation of safety codes or regulations that may be made under the Health Act, 1953, by the Minister for Health or under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to paragraph (a), certain radioactive substances and devices, because of their possible use in nuclear weapons or in the manufacture of fuels or other materials for nuclear weapons, are subject to international controls on supply and use.  Countries from which such substances or devices might be supplied may subject their supply to certain conditions aimed at preventing their diversion to non-peaceful uses.  In particular, most countries of the world including Ireland, are parties to the <Col N="1771" /> Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  Under this treaty, nuclear-weapon states party to it undertake not to transfer nuclear weapons or the ability to make them to any recipient. Non-nuclear-weapon states party to it undertake not to receive the transfer of any such weapons or such ability and also undertake to arrange through an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, called a &ldquo;safeguards&rdquo; agreement, for the verification by the Agency of the fulfilment of their obligations under the Treaty.  Ireland as a member of the Euratom Treaty is also subject to the &ldquo;safeguards&rdquo; provisions of that Treaty relating to the non-diversion of nuclear material to military purposes.</P>
    <P>If a person in Ireland wishes to obtain any of the relevant substances or devices it will be necessary that the required safeguards agreements be concluded between Ireland and the supplying country or the international organisations.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) will enable the Minister, with the agreement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is responsible for Ireland's disarmament policy, to devolve the function of negotiating the necessary supply agreements and making the necessary arrangements to the institute, if it is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) will enable the Minister to assign to the institute a role in relation to any safety codes or regulations made under the Health Act, 1953, or under occupational safety legislation, if such a role is considered appropriate.  There are powers under the Health Act, 1953, and under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work legislation for the Ministers for Health and Labour to control the use of radioactive substances and devices within their areas of responsibility.  The Minister for Health's responsibility relates to the medical uses of ionising radiation and the Minister for Labour's responsibility relates to the safety of workers, including those using ionising radiation.  With the existence of the powers of the Minister for Energy under the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971, which will <Col N="1772" /> be replaced by the powers under this Bill, there is a certain degree of overlap in the responsibilities of the three Ministers as set out in the legislation.  In practice, of course, appropriate arrangements have been worked out among the various bodies concerned.  However, this paragraph will, if it is necessary, enable the implementation of any measures introduced by the Ministers to be centralised in the institute.</P>
    <P>So far, no regulations have been made by the Minister for Health under the Health Act, 1953, relating to radiation and so the question does not arise at present in relation to that Minister. Regulations relating to the control of radiation used in the industrial sector, dating from 1972, have been made by the Minister for Labour and are enforced by the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.  The undertakings to which those regulations apply are also covered by the licensing system operated by the Nuclear Energy Board, and which will be taken over by the institute.  If it is considered appropriate in the future that the institute should enforce those regulations or any other relevant codes or regulations that may be made under occupational safety legislation, paragraph (b) will enable the Minister to confer the necessary powers on the institute.</P>
    <P>By virtue of paragraph (c), an order assigning functions to the institute under paragraph (a) or (b) may, if it is considered necessary, include powers to enable the institute to control the custody, use, manufacture, importation and so on of radioactive substances or devices.  There are no specific circumstances in mind at present in which it would be considered desirable to assign such powers but it is prudent to make provision for this in case it is considered desirable at any time in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for what seemed to be a very comprehensive reply but I am not sure I picked up all the implications of it.  Perhaps a few more questions put in layman terms would satisfy the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1773" /> It seems that we are providing that the radiological institute may in the future if they wish bring in radioactive devices which could, as I see it, be anything from an X-ray machine to a nuclear generating station.  This section seems in some way to make provision for this.  From my reading of the section, it does not seem to be confined to compliance with the non-proliferation agreements into which we have entered.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify in simpler terms the precise limits of the section and explain why no specific references are written into the section on the non-proliferation agreements or other agreements to which he referred in the course of his reply so that we would know exactly to what it refers.</P>

My reply, which explained what is covered by the entire section, was meant to be helpful to the Deputy.  Section 9 (2) (a) and (b) cover such matters as the importation, control, manufacture, distribution transportation and so on of radioactive substances.  Is the Deputy satisfied with that answer?</P>

That is the way I read section 9 (2) (a) but I take it that is not the Minister's intention.  My reading of the section does not indicate that that could not be an interpretation of it.</P>

There is no intention to change the policy in relation to the establishment of nuclear power stations here.  Obviously, that would be a matter for the Government.  The Deputy, and the House, are fully aware of what Government policy in this area has been for many years.  Therefore, there is no question of this happening.</P>

      <P>The Minister's explanation is totally at variance with the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  He made no reference to the explanation given in the explanatory memorandum in regard to section 9 which states:</P>
      <P>Section 9 provides for the assignment of additional functions to the institute by order of the Minister including functions in relation to directives or regulations of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>I thought the Minister was going to say that this explanation would satisfy Deputy Flaherty's point about minimum standards under EC Directives but he made no reference in his reply to EC Directives.  What is the relationship between the explanatory memorandum and the Minister's statement?  Do they deal with the same section?  Section 9 simply lists the functions which may be assigned to the institute.  Will these functions relate mainly to future EC Directives which may be introduced?  Why will these new functions be required?</P>

      <P>They are textual corrections to section 9 (2) (a) on which I <Col N="1775" /> am seeking clarification as to its precise meaning.  As Deputy Mac Giolla rightly pointed out, the explanatory memorandum refers to the making of arrangements for the supply of radioactive substances or devices as one of the functions which may be devolved to the institute. Why would we devolve this power to the institute in this apparently loose way?  If the State decide at some stage to have a nuclear generator for energy purposes no one in their right mind would suggest that an institute charged with the protection of the public from such generating stations should be the body involved in making the arrangements for setting it up and so on.  Essentially, I do not understand the section as it is presently worded.  The Minister's textual corrections to the section do not make what he is trying to do any clearer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section states clearly that there has to be agreement of the Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It relates to the supply of radio-active substances or devices which the Minister may specify by order.  This could relate to a wide range of substances which I listed in the long reply I gave.  I am not clear what specific point the Deputy is trying to get at.</P>

      <P>The Government may decide, as was their view in the past, that a nuclear generating station should be set up here, something I do not think any side of the House wants.  If the Government decided to do this section 9 seems to provide that they could instruct the institute to procure that station for them.  It does not seem correct that an institute whose job it is to protect the public interest and act independently of the Minister should be asked, by way of order, to procure a generating station. Perhaps I am completely misreading the section but as I read it that is a possible interpretation of the section.  If that is an interpretation of it it is very unsatisfactory. If the Minister wants to ask the institute to make arrangements for the procurement of radioactive substances it <Col N="1776" /> should be only in the context of the direct work in which the institute are involved. For example, they may want to bring in a substance which has to do with setting standards for calibrating X-ray machines and so on.  I could understand why the Minister would, by order, ask the institute to bring in something which would strengthen their role in monitoring and policing the use of radioactive substances. It certainly does not seem right that if a Government of the day at some stage decided to go nuclear in energy generation, they would have the powers suggested by subsection (2) (a).</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Bruton when he says there are anomalies here.  When the Nuclear Energy Board were in existence we felt that, like all nuclear energy boards, they were too pronuclear to be protective of the public. Now a good independent institute is being established to protect the public from nuclear substances or devices, radiation and so on.  From the interpretation in the explanatory memorandum the Minister seems to be giving them what would be the powers of a nuclear energy board, to promote and supply radioactive substances and devices.  I do not understand why they should have that power. They should oversee other people, the Department of Energy or whoever imports or supplies radioactive substances and devices, and protect the public against them.  Is it a method of raising finance that they should do all the importing and selling of these substances? I can understand them overseeing the carriage, supply and transport of these substances and safety precautions in their transport, but to actually supply them seems extraordinary.  There is an anomaly there as between a protective board and a supplying board.</P>

I presume the current position is that individual institutes make their own arrangements.  Is it proposed that the new <Col N="1777" /> institute would have a greater role in the procurement of these items?  Would they be a single supplying source?  What is the thinking behind this?

      <P>Section 9 (2) (a), as I have already told the House, enables the Minister, with the agreement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who, as we know, is responsible for Ireland's disarmament policy, to devolve to the institute the function of negotiating the necessary supply agreements and making <Col N="1778" /> the necessary arrangements if it is considered appropriate.  There are no circumstances under consideration where it would be deemed appropriate at present, but in order to fulfil the Minister for Foreign Affairs' responsibilities in that matter, it is important to make this provision in subsection (2) (a).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If this has to do with the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to disarmament, non-proliferation and so on, the least we could expect is that that would be in the section. As it reads it could be interpreted that a future Government deciding to supply nuclear generation could do so through the auspices of an institute which, as Deputy Mac Giolla said, is designed for protection rather than for supply.  If an institute are in the business of supplying, their independence must inevitably be interfered with.  Perhaps the Minister should consider for Report Stage whether this section needs to be tightened up in view of the concerns that have been expressed.  It would give him a chance to discuss with the Minister for Foreign Affairs precisely his requirements in this regard.</P>

      <P>I have just come in on the debate and listened to some of the comments.  I understand the Minister's position but this Government have adopted a very definite stance on the nuclear question.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister have a very definite position on disarmament.  If this section in any way misinterprets that Government position, it would be worth looking at.  Perhaps the Minister would look at the language used in the section. Ireland is a non-nuclear nation.  We have a very respected position at foreign affairs level in the UN in any debates on disarmament.  I do not envisage a day when we will have a nuclear capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill which is a very radical and positive one establishing an independent Radiological Protection Institute should encompass that general principle.  If there is any danger that the Bill might misinterpret our international standing on <Col N="1779" /> the whole question of nuclear policy or disarmament, we should look at it.  Perhaps, as suggested, the Minister might consult with the Minister for Foreign Affairs before Report Stage, and in some way tighten the language of the section. That would be a good day's work.  The Minister's assurances have been very positive.  Since I came in on this debate in the last half hour or so he has stated a very specific position, but perhaps the language could be tightened up in some way.</P>

We could deal with it again on Report Stage if what Deputies suggest is appropriate.  It is important to put on the record, in view of some of the suggestions that have been made, that we are, as Deputy Kitt and others have confirmed, very much a non-nuclear weapon State.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and in so being Ireland has foregone the right to acquire or develop nuclear weapons.  Furthermore, we have actively supported all efforts to reduce existing arsenals of weapons held by the five acknowledged nuclear weapon powers.  As I said previously, the only acceptable level of nuclear weapons is zero.  This has been the policy of successive Governments and continues to be a fundamental element of Irish foreign policy.  Indeed Ireland is a prominent opponent of nuclear weapons and, as an author of the non-proliferation treaty, will continue to be committed to the elimination of nuclear weapons.  I am happy to reconsider the matter but it is important to remind the House that subsection (2) (a) is merely an enabling provision to cover possible eventualities in the future. However, an eventuality has been raised <Col N="1780" /> on which the House has asked me to consult the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I am happy to do that.</P>

We may not have nuclear weapons or generate a nuclear supply of electricity but, if we did not have nuclear power in one form or another, parts of our health service and engineering services would collapse; we are dependent on the proper use of nuclear energy for advances in science.  I welcome the use of nuclear energy in the advances which have been made in medicine and in engineering as, without them, we would still be almost in the Stone Age with regard to diagnostic procedures in the health services.  This talk about being a non-nuclear nation is codswallop.  By facing up to the fact that we are dependent on nuclear energy and by going on from there we can formulate our policy to deal with the problems which arise subsequently from the natural waste outfall from the use of nuclear energy.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) (c) says that the Minister may, from time to time, by order, extend the powers and functions of the institute to cover such matters pertaining to non-ionising radiation as may be specified in the order.  This is a very important matter which we have not examined.  It is necessary to protect the public and the environment from the hazards of non-ionising radiation, for example, the electro-magnetic fields around high voltage power lines and microwave radiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister made an order pursuant to this section, I should like to remind Deputies that, as Minister for Energy, he would in effect be dealing with his own problems.  I very strongly feel that this subsection should be omitted, which would mean that if there were any problems in this area they would be referred to the Department of the Environment or, better still and more specifically, to the proposed Environmental Protection Agency.  There is a clear conflict of interest here: the hazardous side-effects of these activities, electricity transmission, which clearly forms part of the <Col N="1782" /> brief of the Minister for Energy, should not be dealt with by the Department. It is highly inappropriate and, for that reason, the subsection should be omitted. I will be tabling an amendment for Report Stage in regard to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) enables the Minister to extend, by order, the institute's activities to non-ionising radiation such as microwaves and radiowaves. There is, at present, no central authority in Ireland for the assessment of the effects of non-ionising radiation, laying down protection measures and the regulation of its occurrence.  Apparently, there is no clear evidence of any adverse effects from this radiation but the matter is receiving greater attention worldwide. There is concern in some circles, for example, about the effects of radiation from electricity cables.  If the institute are to take on this new function they will have to acquire the necessary expertise and resources, as the existing expertise and resources relating to ionising radiation may not be appropriate for non-ionising radiation.  Before any decision to extend the institute's responsibilities to non-ionising radiation can be taken, it will be necessary to consider, in consultation with other relevant Government agencies &mdash; the Department of Communications, the Department of the Environment, which was mentioned by Deputy Garland, the Department of Health and other bodies such as the ESB &mdash; what needs to be done and to which bodies responsibility should be assigned. It is, therefore, premature to extend functions in relation to non-ionising radiation to the institute.  However, I should like to indicate to the House that it is an area which I intend to have examined by my Department as soon as possible.</P>

As a member of a local authority, I have some little knowledge with regard to the introduction of services for the fire brigade.  In some cases people tend to delay wondering whether the fire is sufficiently serious to warrant calling the fire brigade and incurring a charge.  On this section, will the Minister elaborate further on what exactly is meant by the charges?</P>
      <P>Section 10 (1) &ldquo;... provided or carried on for the Minister&rdquo;.  Why does the Minister not include other Ministers? Why is it just the Minister for Energy?  I have in mind the Minister for Health and the Minister for the Environment being covered under this subsection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, since the Nuclear Energy Board, or the institute, are funded under the Vote for the Department of Energy, it would not make a great deal of sense if the Department were to be charged.  The institute are there to advise the public and the Minister for Energy in particular in relation to these matters, but other Ministers, as the Deputy says, provide a wide range of services.  I think it is appropriate in a case like this that some charge be made, nominal in many cases, to cover some of the expenses involved. That may not be appropriate in all cases because it is only in some cases the charges are levied.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to hear Deputy Pattison being critical of some of the local authority charges when we consider the long debate we had here when his party proposed the introduction of those charges. Let us not go back to that argument, but that is the reality.  The legislation that introduced those charges was brought in by the Deputy's party in Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I had a number of relations there protesting long before the policy was changed at Dublin level. It is appropriate that the institute be in a position to charge for their functions, services or activities wherever that is provided for by the Minister.  It is likely the institute will continue the fee earning activities already carried on by the Nuclear Energy Board.  Indeed, a substantial proportion of their revenue comes from this area.  These activities are, for instance, the processing on behalf of radiation users of dosimeters worn by their staff, the provision of analytical and certification services to food exporters &mdash; I see no reason they should not pay for that service; it is costing the State a substantial sum of money to maintain the fairly elaborate laboratory facilities provided by the NEB at present; testing of radiation equipment and in recent times extensive testing for radon in dwellings where the fee is a very nominal £15.  Fees at present earned by the NEB from these various activities represent about a quarter of their total revenue.  In the processing of the dosimeters, users are obliged to monitor the doses received by their staff in the course of their work, and the NEB maintain dose records on behalf of the users for all persons monitored and retain them for 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of certification of food exports, following the Chernobyl accident many countries require certification that foodstuffs they imported comply with international standards of radiation content.  The export of food from this country is very dependent on certification by the NEB.  I have visited the laboratory and was very impressed with the extensive work being carried out there.  If any of the spokespersons from any parties <Col N="1785" /> would like to visit I issue an invitation to them to come and see the work of the NEB soon, it is hoped, to become the institute.  I have other examples but I think the case can genuinely be made that there is a need for the institute to have the legislative authority to make these charges.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 40 to 44, to delete subsection (5).</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes an alternative to what the Minister is doing.  I am glad to see the Minister in his amendment, has decided he will not take the power to appoint the first chief executive officer but that he will leave this for the institute. The purpose of my amendment is to delete subsection (5).  In amendment No. 67 I have recommended that the chief executive officer be appointed by the President upon a resolution passed by the Dáil and the Seanad recommending the appointment of this person.  That model is taken from the Ombudsman Act and our party regard the position of chief executive officer of the institute as being on a par with the Ombudsman in terms of the need for independence in his role. That was the alternative I put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Linked to this debate about the chief executive officer is the board of the institute. It causes me some concern that the Minister's amendment in this regard, where he is talking about having people of expertise on the board, is framed in such a way that while he says that not more than five shall be appointed, he can get away with only one person of expertise.  This is a rather strange provision with which we will deal later.  The <Col N="1788" /> essence of my amendment was to withdraw the notion that the Minister should appoint the chief executive and to change the notion of the ministerial appointed board selecting the chief executive to the notion that the Dáil and Seanad would have a role in picking the chief executive officer.  I did so in the belief that this position should be one of exceptional independence, in much the same way as the Ombudsman is regarded by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting amendment No. 23 in my name.  The effects of amendments Nos. 23 and 24 are the same.  The Minister's amendment has accepted that deletion which will mean that the chief executive officer shall be appointed and may be removed from office at any time by the institute with the consent of the Minister.  That is the best procedure.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman position could not be equated with that.  In an institute like this the chief executive officer must be subject to the board and an occasion may arise when the board will want to fire a chief executive officer.  That is the procedure in regard to a chief executive officer in any institute or any board.  The Ombudsman is not like a chief executive officer of any institute, being subject to a board. The Ombudsman is a distinctive and special appointment.  The Ombudsman can inquire into any body or into any institute and he can demand whatever information he wants in pursuance of his objectives.  This is not related to the work of a chief executive officer.  However, it is virtually important that the institute be independent and be able to appoint or fire a chief executive officer.  The independence of the institute is what we must maintain in the Bill.  The institute should be able to carry on their business without political interference from the Department or the Government.  That can be achieved with the procedure, now accepted by the Minister, of appointments being made by the institute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the amendments to the extent that they meet <Col N="1789" /> some of the points we raised.  The process of amending this Bill has been to take it out from under the Minister's control, with the willing support of the Minister whom we have convinced of our view. Fine Gael would have preferred a different model integrated with the Environmental Protection Agency role, as the basic aim of this is to protect Irish citizens as much as possible from the dangers that exist from the use of radioactive substances in the State.  Although they are used for the general good they lead to many problems.  The approach of the Government is flawed although it is improving as we go along.</P>
      <P>While we would like the approach outlined in the Schedule, the Minister's amendment goes at least some way down the road in meeting our reservations and it conforms to the more conventional model of how chief executives of boards operate.  It was extraordinary that the Bill as originally drafted proposed such an involvement from the Department.  I raise that, not to batter the Minister, but to encourage him to continue perhaps even more generously down the road he has taken, to row back as many as possible of the negative elements in this Bill to make it as strongly independent as possible.  We welcome the amendment although it means we will not reach our further amendments which we are discussing in conjunction with this.  Ours would have been a fundamentally better approach.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 22 to 29, to delete subsections (1) and (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Institute shall cause a report on the performance of its functions under this Act to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas annually, and may from time to time cause to be laid before each House such other reports with respect to those functions as he sees fit.  The terms of any direction under section 20 shall be included in a report under this section.</P>
      <P>(2)  Notwithstanding the generality of these reports each annual report shall include&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  a report of any notification <Col N="1792" /> made to the Institute under section 34 of this Act,</P>
    <P>(b)  a report of the current state of preparedness of the National Radiological Emergency Plan and any trials of procedures within that plan which have been undertaken during the year.</P>
    <P>(c)  report on the arrangements for the disposal of radioactive waste emerging from activities within the State, and</P>
    <P>(d)  any information in such form and regarding such matters as the Institute sees fit.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the institute should report directly to the Oireachtas rather than have their reports sanitised by the Minister before they would go through.  I know that would not be the intention of the Minister.  He would have copies of the original report laid before each House without change.  The purpose of this amendment is to see that the report contains certain elements as a minimum.  We are anxious to see a very high level of reporting from an institute like this to the Oireachtas, so that we can keep up-to-date with what they are doing in the way of protecting the public.  The proposed section puts some specific requirements on the reporting by the institute.  Among the matters the Oireachtas has a right to have reported directly to it is the occurrence of any accident under section 34.  If accidents occur they should be promptly notified to the Oireachtas and any action necessary should be made known to Members of the Houses and appropriate action taken.</P>
    <P>We also provide for a report on the current state of preparedness of the emergency plan.  The essence of any successful emergency plan, particularly in this area where it is unlikely the plan will ever be called into use, would be regular reporting and testing of the plan to make sure it is up to scratch.  What shocked many people about Chernobyl was the poor preparedness of many of the countries, despite the existence of different <Col N="1793" /> bodies to respond to the crisis.  It is important that part of the annual reporting by the institute should include an up-to-date report of testing and the procedures that would constitute an emergency plan.</P>
    <P>The other item which concerns the House is the arrangement for the disposal of radioactive waste emerging from activities within the State.  It is acknowledged by the Minister and the House that things are not as they should be.  It is important that the institute report on a regular basis to the House so that we can see if progress is being made.  This is re-enforcing the provision for direct reporting to the Oireachtas on matters that are of major concern to the House on an annual basis and that would be part of the institute's reporting function.</P>
    <P>The one element of the amendment which is no longer relevant relates to the terms of a direction under section 20, where the Minister has amended his original position in a way which most people will welcome.  It is worthwhile spelling out the form of reporting that the Oireachtas expects from the institute on an annual basis in their reports.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  An important function of the institute will be to keep the public and public representatives informed.  It is important that reports be made to the House on a number of issues.  It is important that we are aware of what the institute are doing, as specified by Deputy Bruton, that we are aware of the plans in hand and arrangements made as regards the disposal of waste.  There was a danger in the past, and there still is, of nuclear energy boards engaging in a high degree of secrecy.  The hallmark of the nuclear industry is secrecy about security, keeping the lid on and not letting people know what is happening.  That creates suspicion. People are prepared to believe anything when they are not told to the contrary.  When they are not aware of what is happening, rumours abound. There is no reason why there should be secrecy here in regard to the use of radio-active substances.  Safety is a crucial issue as far as the institute are concerned.  The <Col N="1794" /> more knowledge people have the more credit they will give the institute, the more confidence they will have in them and the better they will be able to adopt the directives or suggestions from the institute in regard to safety.  It is important that the institute report to the House on their activities.</P>

      <P>It is extremely important that Deputy Bruton's amendment be taken on board.  The areas he thinks should be clearly covered in the report are important.  It is not good enough for the content of the report to be left to the discretion of the Minister.</P>
      <P>There are two other matters which could usefully be added to Deputy Bruton's list of contents.  The first is that the annual report should include a report summarising the results of any monitoring of radioctivity carried out by or for the institute.  Another interesting matter that section 19 deals with is the power to accept subscriptions and donations.  I feel rather strongly that if subscriptions or donations are received by the board pursuant to this section, full details of this should be contained in the annual report.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment also, even though I would prefer to see the retention of lines 22 and 23 and of section 17, because I believe that it <Col N="1795" /> is essential to have time limits on the production of these reports.  Unfortunately, I do not see any reference to a time limit in the amendment, whereas there is a marker put down in the section that is proposed to be deleted.  Having said that, I believe, for the reasons already put forward by the proposer of the amendment, that this amendment should be accepted, while perhaps retaining the words: &ldquo;as soon as may be after the end of each financial year of the Institute, but not later than 6 months thereafter, the Institute shall...&rdquo; and the continuing on with the wording of the amendment.  Would Deputy Bruton agree to that?</P>

      <P>We have not had any notification of that amendment so I do not think it is in order.  So that we will know exactly where we are going, if we get an indication as to what the specific amendment is and having listened to Deputy Allen and Deputy Flaherty who have offered, we can put that in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>When this legislation was published first the hope was that we would have at long last a body that would be entirely independent of ministerial influence.  Section 17 (2) of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>Each report under subsection (1) of this section shall include information in such form and regarding such matters as the Minister may direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That could be a serious erosion of the independence of the institute in reporting on an annual basis.  Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 28 (2) (d) which states: &ldquo;any other information in such form and regarding such matters as the Institute sees fit&rdquo; is an essential element and must be included in order that the institute will have independence, because matters may come up from time to time on which the institute may wish to comment on, and it must have the freedom and flexibility to comment on these matters.  Therefore, it is essential that paragraph (d) would be acceptable by the Minister and, in fact, <Col N="1796" /> that the amendment in full would be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to paragraphs (b) and (c) of the amendment, I was appalled by the lack of reaction to radioactive fallout in this country post-Chernobyl, especially in the weeks afterwards.  That was the first time some people realised that radio-active fallout was trans-continental.  Up to then all our eyes had been focused on Sellafield which was considered to be public enemy number one, but at the time some people did not realise that nuclear pollution is trans-continental.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a need for an up-to-date report on the national radiological emergency plan because there was such an unco-ordinated response to it the last time.  We had State agencies, health boards, local authorities all doing their own thing and there were major gaps in the situation.  Therefore, a report must be published regularly so that this House and the public can be assured that we are prepared.</P>
    <P>We have already dealt with radioactive waste, in previous sessions and again this morning.  We are entitled to know, however, what is happening and it is essential that Members of this House be kept up-to-date on how we are disposing of our radioactive waste.  From now on I hope its disposal will be part of a national plan for waste disposal and that we do not continue with the dependent attitude that has prevailed for so long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">

      <P>This amendment would add a very important element to the Bill. The Radiological Protection Bill is aimed at providing protection for workers and patients in our hospitals; for workers in academic institutions and for the general public in relation to the dangers posed by radiological devices.  This report will be a direct line of communication from the institute annually to the public and it must be an effective form of communication to the public, to us and to organisations like Earthwatch and Green Peace, who take a great interest in this area.  In the development of this Bill we have seen that those involved in the industry have acted traditionally in an atmosphere of <Col N="1797" /> secrecy and it will take them a little time to adjust to the modern communicative approach that is required of all industry, and more particularly of a controversial industry such as the nuclear industry. Therefore, it is important at this stage in the development of this institute and the development of the whole industry nationally and Europeanwise that we demand precise information and that we ensure that the public will be informed in the annual report of the Institute of the major areas of concern currently and for the future.  When we discuss this type of national organisation, it is not uncommon that the annual report is seen as being very important.  It is no less important in this case.  In my experience amendments have been accepted from the Opposition in these areas on quite a regular scale.</P>

Even though we are finishing discussion on Committee Stage, I think it is fair for me to comment that a lot of the wishes of the Opposition have been incorporated in the Bill.  The primary desire was to ensure the establishment of the independence of the proposed institute and I have sought to achieve that objective in the amendments. Deputies will agree that many of the amendments are in my own name for that purpose.  I regret that because of the shortage of time we have not the opportunity to go on to the other amendments.</P>

      <P>At my request, the IDA set up, in March 1989, a task force to develop the stone industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force have carried out a national survey of available stone.  Two reports on granite in Galway and Mayo have been completed and presented to <Col N="1801" /> the industry.  Studies on granite in Donegal and Leinster are under way.</P>
    <P>The task force is also working with the Irish Goods Council to increase the use of Irish stone in the construction industry in Ireland.  An investigation is under way to quantify productive capacity and to identify additional home market business. On the export market, surveys have been carried out in Germany and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Arising from the study the Industrial Development Authority is encouraging and assisting companies to avail of opportunities and have negotiated the expansion of a number of enterprises which will generate new jobs.</P>

I have always been very keen on having developed the resource that Irish stone represents.  Throughout Ireland we have a great variety of stone which has an almost infinite variety of uses today for construction and for industrial purposes.  It was to see what could be done to get that resource fully utilised in the national interest that I established this task force and got the IDA fully involved.  I believe we are making progress now and I will be glad to consider what is the best way to publish these reports so that we can arouse a maximum amount of public interest in our stone resources.  I would also like to get them to the notice, as much as possible, of potential investors in the industry.</P>

The Deputy will know, of course, that this is also the anniversary of the death of Parnell and it is the year in which Dublin is the European City of Culture.  In the case of the latter there will be a wide programme of events connected with that and many of them will relate to the 1916 anniversary.

      <P>Would the Taoiseach <Col N="1803" /> agree that in commemorating the year 1916 special efforts should also be made to commemorate the many thousands of Irish people from both parts and both traditions of the island who died in France, particularly in the battle of the Somme?  Would he agree that the commemoration of 1916 should take account of the fact that those people died for what they considered to be an important cause; that they were all Irish and that we should aim, in commemorating 1916 75 years later, to be inclusive of all the various traditions on this island rather than simply commemorating, very rightly and justly, one particular and very important anniversary, that of Easter week?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will know, and I hope he would agree, that we have at last found a satisfactory formula for commemorating all those who died in past wars and on service with the United Nations in the ceremony we now hold in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham on 14 July.  Between us in this House we came to an agreement that we should do that and that that was the best way to solve all the difficulties, antagonisms and conflicts which arose from time to time over different ceremonies.  I am glad to say that that ceremony has now established itself very successfully and I think it is accepted by the public very much in the spirit for which it was established.  That ceremony will, of course, be held again this year. To that extent it will commemorate the death of people who died in 1916 as well as the people who died all over the world during the course of our history.  There will be some special dignified ceremonies relating to Easter Week and the Proclamation this year.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree or, perhaps, undertake to convey to various councils and organisations that are being encouraged by the Government to commemorate 1916 that it is important to emphasise that this is but one part or our heritage and that there are other traditions on this island which do not see 1916 in the same light as many of us do, particularly in view of the fact that 1916 may be used by the Provisional IRA to justify their activities, and that this is one of the main concerns which many people have?  Also, is the Taoiseach aware &mdash; if my memory of my school history is correct &mdash; that this is the 200th anniversary of the foundation of the United Irishmen which, perhaps, had an even more profound impact on Irish politics for the last 200 years than 1916? Addressing ourselves to that event might also help to clarify the role of 1916, the role of Irish politics and the unity of Catholic-Protestant and dissenter in Ireland today.</P>

I am anxious that Easter Week 1916 and the Proclamation should be celebrated in a dignified way which is related to that great event in our history. I have, of course, always indicated that there are a number of different traditions on this island.  We all expressed very clearly and very sincerely in the report of the <i>New Ireland Forum</i> an acknowledgment of all the traditions and the contribution all our traditions made to the Ireland we have today.  I think we found the right formula, first, in having one simple central ceremony at the GPO, and then having our 14th of July celebration to commemorate all those who died during the course of our history, and then encouraging local bodies and authorities throughout the country to have their own local ceremonies.</P>

      <P>As my own party's representative on that all-party committee, I should like to put on record that I agree with the Taoiseach in relation to separating the two ceremonies.  The ceremony on 14th of July should be held for the purpose for which it was designed, and the 1916 commemoration should be dealt with separately.  The decision and recommendation of the Taoiseach, with particular reference to the local celebrations or commemorations, is more than adequate.</P>

This is more important than any commemorations we might institute &mdash; not that I am against those celebrations, very much the reverse but I would ask the Taoiseach to see if there is something we could do to bring about a real awareness among the young people and the students of today so that by the year 2000 our people will not have forgotten about 1916.</P>

When does he expect the <Col N="1809" /> Government to make a decision in relation to the proposals?  Does he intend to proceed with the suggestion that the Government should consider an amendment to section 4 of the 1989 Finance Act to provide incentives for development in the area?  What relationship will CIE, who are the owners of the property concerned, have with the new company, Temple Bar Properties Limited?</P>

      <P>I have received the report recently.  I will certainly favourably consider publishing the report unless there are some technical difficulties in the way.  Secondly, the range of financial and other incentives to be established for the area is being considered.  Thirdly, CIE will have no particular function in regard to the development of the area.  CIE's involvement is that they are the property owners at the moment.</P>

      <P>Given that the redevelopment of the Temple Bar area is a Government flagship project for Dublin European City of Culture 1991, can the Minister be a bit more forthcoming about the timescale envisaged for this project? Can he tell the House the estimated value of the site to CIE?  What is the position of CIE in regard to the proposals in so far as they are the owners of the site, having acquired it as a site for a central bus station?  The Taoiseach has dismissed any role for CIE except as owners of a property.  Can he elaborate on the value of the site to CIE.  In other words, has the arrangement between CIE and Temple Bar Properties Limited been reached on an agreed basis?</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will consider the appointment of a Minister of State with sole responsibility for women's affairs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the advancement of the status of women in our society is best achieved by assigning that responsibility, as I have done, to each Minister is his or her functional area.</P>
      <P>I have, in addition, assigned responsibility for monitoring and co-ordinating the implementation of equality between women and men in all areas of Government policy to the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>
      <P>The Government's positive commitment in this area is evident from the major initiative of establishing the Second Commission on the Status of Women with its mandate to make farreaching recommendations to the Government on the means to enable women to participate on equal terms and conditions in the economic, social, political and cultural life of our society, with special attention to the needs of women in the home.</P>
      <P>An improvement in the situation of women is also an important focus in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which the Government have agreed with the social partners through measures such as special provisions for increases for the low paid, most of whom are women; a commitment to substantially raise recruitment age limits throughout the public service; a commitment to increase FÁS targets for the training of women in non-traditional occupations; and a commitment to provide créche facilities at training centres.</P>
      <P>All these initiatives, and I emphasise that they are merely a set of examples not a complete list, are specifically intended to bring about equal opportunities for Irish women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, finally, to affirm clearly that the Government listen sympathetically to the expressed concerns of women and respond positively to them.  My Department have this year substantially increased the level of funding of the Council for the Status of Women.  The <Col N="1811" /> recently enacted legislation on rape was drafted very much taking into account the concerns of the people who assist rape victims, and the planned legislation on part-time workers has been widely welcomed by women as bringing protection to this very vulnerable category of society.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister of State, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, has heavy responsibilities in regard to European Affairs in addition to her role of co-ordinating and monitoring what other Departments are doing, may I ask the Taoiseach what structures exist to carry out these functions of monitoring and co-ordinating?  If any reports are received by his Department as a result of this monitoring and co-ordinating, what kind of follow through is maintained in relation to it?  In 1987 the Taoiseach outlined the areas relating to women for which each Department was responsible.  May I ask him if he intends to place a report before the Dáil at any time arising from Minister Geoghegan-Quinn's functions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Minister of State has a constant on-going preoccupation with this area.  She has the full support of the Taoiseach and his Department in her monitoring and co-ordinating role.  I can assure the Deputy that the Minister of State, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, is specifically active in this area and receives the full co-operatio of her colleagues whose individual function it is to proceed with progress in their different areas of responsibility.  I hope the Deputy might be prepared to agree that the system is working well and that we have achieved very considerable progress since 1987 in this whole area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to agree that progress has been made, obviuosly not as much as any of us would wish, but what is not clear is that this progress is being made as a result of the monitoring and co-ordination role of the Minister of State.  If that is the case &mdash; I prefer to take the Taoiseach's assurance <Col N="1812" /> on the matter &mdash; it is only fair to that Minister that the good work she is doing is made known.  One way of doing that would be to place a report before the House or in the Library on the various functions or departmental inquiries she has made of her colleagues in relation to the various matters for which they are responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We can always consider that, but I would not agree we should publish the detailed contacts, conversations and so on the Minister of State would have with her Government colleagues.  I can assure the Deputy it is a persistent on-going process.  I would also suggest to the Deputy that the Minister of State, other Ministers and myself report publicly from time to time in this House and elsewhere on the progress being made.  The Deputy, as a Member of the House, is well aware of the legislative progress being made.  If there is some further report mechanism that might be brought forward I will consider it, but I believe what is happening in the different areas is well publicised and well known.</P>

Will he acknowledge that that legislation was again promised when the Fine Gael Bill on judicial separation was passing through this House?  Will the Taoiseach indicate in 1991 when such legislation will be brought forward?  Will <Col N="1813" /> he agree that until such time as there is automatic joint ownership of the family home many thousands of women are disadvantaged in the context of the family home and their ownership rights in it?</P>

      <P>The reform of Dáil procedures is of course primarily a matter for the House as a whole.

      <P>In the programme for Government it was indicated that there would be reform of the Oireachtas, that the committee system, the <i>sub judice</i> ruling and a range of other matters would be addressed.  May I ask the Taoiseach if, as part of the reform, it is intended to appoint any further committees?  I know there has been consultation in relation to the establishment of a foreign affairs committee.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will take this opportunity to give an update to the House on progress in that regard. Does the Taoiseach think the voting procedure in this House needs to be reformed in view of the time it takes, particularly when there are a series of votes?  Indeed, constant problems arise on the floor of the House in relation to priority questions and how they are dealt with.  Has the Taoiseach any proposals in relation to those matters?</P>

      <P>This matter is best pursued on the basis of the greatest possible degree of consensus between the parties and to that extent I would rather leave it at this stage to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to get on with the reforms they see as most urgent and most appropriate.  On the question of voting procedures, I could be tendentious about that but I will refrain from being so. Improvements are made from time to time in our procedures here, but I am afraid I would have to be critical if the Deputy were to draw me out much further on that whole area.  In regard to committees, I assure the Deputy that discussions and negotiations with regard to <Col N="1816" /> the foreign affairs committee are proceeding.</P>

Would the Taoiseach not agree it is about time we all &mdash; I mean this sincerely &mdash; worked to make this place more relevant to the general public, particularly to the young people who must spend their time there bewildered at the activities that go on?  Finally, would the Taoiseach seriously consider introducing Dáil sittings on Fridays so that Private Members' Bills can be taken, reports from committees can be debated openly and so that we can be brought up to date on current issues without continuous wrangling on the Order of Business seeking time to debate urgent matters?</P>

We accepted a suggestion from Deputy Bruton with a view to trying to obviate that process.  I do not agree with the Deputy; it is very easy to say what he said about any institution.  This House by and large gets through its work as effectively as any other Parliament, and all the criticism the Deputy can level at this Parliament could be levelled at most other Parliaments.

The Fine Gael Party are the only party which have tabled proposals in that committee for the reform of the Dáil.

      <P>The Government are always prepared, by means of special debate, answers at Question Time and by means of Private Notice Questions, to give the House and the public as much relevant up to date information on current matters as possible.  We are always prepared to consider ways of doing that but there must be a balance in this matter. We have a legislative programme to get through and if we spend our time and days here responding to the latest newspaper controversy it would not be very productive either.  With regard to the matter which the Deputy mentioned, I am afraid that whatever bad tricks the current ringmaster television tutor of the Fine Gael Party have, he learned them from The Workers' Party.</P>

      <Quest>if, in the light of the forthcoming census of population, he is prepared to ask the Central Statistics Office to include a question to the heads of households in respect of (a) the number of members of the household who have emigrated since the last census, (b) their current place of domicile and (c) other relevant matters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>The census of population is not a suitable means to <Col N="1820" /> obtain the information on gross emigration flows over a five year period to which the Deputy refers.  The census covers all persons who are actually in the State on census night and the information is recorded by the individual householder. Information in respect of persons not in the State on census night is not sought as this would have to be supplied by a householder in relation to any such persons and could lead to difficulties particularly with regard to memory recall.  Questions of this nature are best answered in an interviewer based survey such as the labour force survey.  This is confirmed by the experience of the CSO in a significant number of other statistical surveys.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office are in fact exploring the possibility of making estimates of gross emigration flows using the series of annual labour force surveys which are interviewer based.  Some results have already been obtained but these results will have to be assessed over several surveys before a conclusion can be reached on whether the derived information is a reasonable indicator of the level or trend of emigration.</P>
      <P>In any event, the forms for the census of population to be taken on 21 April next have already been printed.  The distribution of these forms to all the households in the State is scheduled to commence on Tuesday, 2 April.  It would not be feasible at this stage to make any changes to the content of the census form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Minister of State serious when he said that this could lead to difficulties with regard to memory recall?  I am merely asking to have a basic question inserted in relation to the number of people who were in the household in 1986, who have now departed, and their place of domicile.  I asked a question two weeks ago in relation to the number of people who were born here and who were now living outside the State, but the Minister said it was not feasible or practical to furnish this information. Will the Minister acknowledge that we cost the taxpayers several million <Col N="1821" /> pounds to put in place an elaborate census procedure involving enumerators, supervisors, etc?  One basic question could do a lot to establish a certain amount of sociological data which is absolutely vital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Questions on emigration from households over a five year period are not straightforward, particularly in regard to recall problems to which I referred.  Furthermore, the census is not an interviewer type survey; the information on a census form is recorded by the individual householders without the benefit of the type of structured support which can be obtained from a specially trained team of interviewers. It would not be practical, therefore, to follow the suggestion made by Deputy Higgins.</P>

In order to confront our social and employment problems, such information is now essential.  Will he also agree that the failure to ask that question on this census form is a deliberate attempt by the Government to cover up the true figures of the numbers who emigrated due to the policies of the Government?</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> lists a major assault on long term unemployment as one of the key objectives of the long term strategy being proposed in the programme.</P>
      <P>The broad outline of an area based response to long term unemployment is set out in section VII of the programme. The response will be area based, will have local communities as the primary movers, will integrate the various existing initiatives, will involve a progression, in particular to ensuring second-chance education leading to qualifications and, therefore, with a greater real possibility of a job.  In this latter connection, I would emphasise that employers have a major role to play in providing employment opportunities for the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>The programme provides for the Central Review Committee to recommend appropriate arrangements to the Government for decision on such matters as a structure to bring the proposals into existence and monitoring and co-ordination arrangements.  Pending a meeting of the committee it would be premature to comment on individual aspects of the approach such as the provision of employment incentives.</P>

It is not acceptable for the Minister to say it is premature to make any details known at this stage. We have the worst job creation record in Europe at the moment with the exception of Greece.  Does the Minister think sufficient attention has been paid in the programme to providing jobs, particularly for the long term unemployed?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the last programme far exceeded expectations.  This programme aims at 60,000 jobs in manufacturing and services and 15,000 jobs in tourism.  We <Col N="1826" /> hope it will pass that.  Section VII is about an area based attack on long term unemployment and using education, social welfare, training, labour and other aspects to try to tackle long term unemployment. As the programme provides, the Central Review Committee will see how best that should be tackled.  There were questions to the Taoiseach by the Leader of the Opposition some weeks ago and the Taoiseach expanded on that.  I do not think there is anything pious or aspirational about it.  There is a meeting this afternoon between the social partners and officials to work out the precise details, but it will involve local organisations, FÁS, Education, health boards, local communities and action groups, and I believe it will be successful.  The small print of how exactly they will interrelate with one another will be spelled out later.</P>

      <P>It is the Government's number one priority.  I would be glad to discuss job creation for the afternoon, but the Deputy asked about the long term unemployed and other aspects.  It is the Government's priority, primarily with the agencies which come under the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Minister for Labour is involved in helping those who cannot find a job.  He is involved all the time with about 30,000 people.  The communities and organisations involved are those well known bodies who are in every region of the country are involved in action programmes to assist long term unemployed people.  The groups are involved usually with the Departments of Education, Labour and Social Welfare.  Any other body anxious to participate should be involved once they positively want to help long term unemployed people.</P>

The success of this scheme over anything that has been done to date will be its progression with courses, schemes, work experience and education leading to a job, not just what we have done for too long, giving somebody the opportunity for 12 months and then forgetting about them after that.</P>

    <P>Training is also provided in a significant way by other Departments and statutory agencies and the cost of this expenditure would also have to be taken into account in determining the overall level of investment in training.</P>
    <P>Data maintained by FÁS indicates that the placement rate for mainline programmes such as specific skills training, enterprise and apprenticeship was between 65 per cent and 70 per cent over the period in question.  It would not be appropriate to measure programmes which are catering for disadvantaged groups, solely on their placement in employment rates.  Some of these programmes prepare young people for progression to mainline training or return to education.  For CERT courses, the placement rate is nearly 100 per cent from formal craft courses and over 80 per cent for courses for unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>There are many views on how the value of training should be assessed.  The placement rate is an obvious yardstick and on that basis both FÁS and CERT perform exceptionally well.  However, I asked FÁS some time ago to carry out further research in this area.  This was done on behalf of FÁS by the ESRI and I understand that the results are currently being analysed.</P>
    <P>FÁS and CERT also provide training support for persons in employment which is much sought after by employers.  The economic value of such training to the employers is indicated in the fact that they use these schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to absorb all the information in the Minister's reply.  I am sure he is aware of the report published by the European Centre for the <Col N="1829" /> Development of Vocational Training which placed and ranked Ireland 17th out of 22 in terms of human resources. Arising out of the investment over that period, is the Minister satisfied that this is reflected in an increased output and productivity for the economy which obviously has a big bearing on our place in the world report which has been published?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to that.  We spend over £200 million alone through the State agencies, FÁS and CERT, involved in training.  We do very well in that and FÁS have figures of 80 per cent in the areas of craft and apprenticeships and CERT 100 per cent.  In fact one of our problems is that we could do with more people in CERT and we are dealing with that at the moment.  On the other side I am not happy about the area of private enterprise management training &mdash; that is what the report features.  It is not that long ago since we found that about three-quarters of our companies spend less than £1,000 a year on that.  I gave the analogy about that, that they spend on newspapers what they spend on management training.  This is the year of the manager and a sincere attempt is being made for the first time in many years, led by the IMI and involving the IPA, IPM and other organisations, to try to get the private sector to spend more money and more resources on training. That is something that needs to be done; it has been ignored for many years.</P>

      <P>The Minister is obviously aware that in Japan expenditure is ten times that of Britain per adult worker. Figures are not available for Ireland in that context.  Is the Minister satisfied with the flexibility of expenditure of this European money in terms of more educational opportunities, of training and advantage for our workers in view of the results of the competition report clearly indicating that West Germany, the USA and Japan are streets ahead of everyone else in output and productivity as a result of the high level of investment in quality training?</P>

      <P>I would not compare us with Japan in relation to the resources we put in.  In the report the Deputy referred to chapter after chapter indicate that a huge proportion of the profits of the private sector are put into giving high level training.  We are trying to do that in the State sector and we have to achieve far more in the private sector.  We must ensure, and are ensuring, that the courses we provide are of a good standard and are flexible.  I have done a lot in the last few years to ensure that courses are more flexible than they used be.  We have not achieved everything and we will have to make further progress.  I am satisfied in relation to EC flexibility at present but there is a difficulty in that the EC are now saying that they will not finance any training by the State unless there is an economic value at the end.  In due course that will create major difficulties for courses for disadvantaged and long term unemployed people.  I am very concerned about that, but it is an issue for another day.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent report from the ESRI Unemployment, Poverty and Psychological Distress which showed that unemployed people are five times more likely to suffer high levels of psychological distress than those at work; if he has any plans for new initiatives in the training or employment areas which could help deal with this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Job creation is central to the Government's economic and commercial policies. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, in addition to repairing Ireland's damaged economic base, <Col N="1831" /> increased the numbers at work by a net 40,000 and demonstrated what can be achieved on a consensus basis.</P>
    <P>The key objectives of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which has been ratified by the employer and worker organisations include a substantial increase in employment and a major assault on long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>The programme aims to create 60,000 new jobs over the next three years in manufacturing and international services and a further 15,000 in tourism over the same period.  Crucial factors in achieving these targets include improvements in the competitiveness of the workforce; the continuation of wage subsidy schemes, and the maintenance of a good industrial relations climate.</P>
    <P>As regards my own area of responsibility, on any one day, there are about 30,000 people participating in FÁS training and employment schemes and a further 3,000 in hotel and catering courses operated by CERT.  I would expect, in broad terms, to maintain the present level of activity and expenditure in the medium term.  Overall, our level of expenditure on active labour market programmes as a percentage of GNP is the highest in the EC.  Recent improvements on the industrial relations front include the establishment of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>With regard to the long term unemployed the ESRI report shows that employment is a key factor in providing the material and intangible rewards necessary for psychological well being. The report points out that the unemployed are five times more likely to develop symptoms of mental health deterioration than those with jobs. Clearly the answer to this problem lies in the creation of meaningful employment, particularly for the long term unemployed &mdash; the category most exposed to the psychological distress caused by prolonged periods of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The findings also suggest that those on State-sponsored training and manpower <Col N="1832" /> schemes have levels of mental health comparable with those of employees.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the initiative in relation to long term unemployment ties in with the conclusions of the ESRI report which states that there would appear to be value in encouraging community development responses which recognise the relevance of resources and support issues, and which have the potential to give the unemployed access to categories of experience previously denied to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, taking into account the number on the live register of 241,000 and the number on training courses that the real number of people unemployed currently is 275,000?  Will the Minister agree that the unemployment figures as projected at 228,000 in the programme for this year are already out of date and that there is a growing crisis of unemployment?  Will he agree that the aspirations contained in the programme even if achieved would leave that problem worse than it is today and that new innovative measures are required, going beyond a small increase in economic growth, to provide real jobs for the many unemployed who require them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures to April <Col N="1833" /> showed an increase last year.  We will require 4 per cent or 5 per cent growth to achieve 20,000 or 30,000 jobs per year. It is realistic to say that we will get growth rates of 7 per cent or 8 per cent this year although it will be particularly difficult to achieve those rates.  I agree that there are 30,000 people on training schemes.  We have all learned in recent years that the opportunity for second chance education, training, work experience and apprenticeship skills gives people a better chance to get into the labour market.  We will do everything we can to give opportunities to the long term unemployed.  A number of local employment initiatives are helping to create jobs but we need high growth rates, a market for our goods and stability to achieve that.  We have achieved that in the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that while the programme has resolved the pay issue and provides a number of commitments in relation to social reforming legislation, by and large it has ignored the problems of unemployment and that the detailed innovative policies required to tackle unemployment difficulties are not addressed in it?  Will the Minister indicate whether there is any new thinking on the part of the Government that goes beyond the programme to get unemployment figures down during the lifetime of the programme?  Will the Minister agree that the safety valve for the programme is predicted on a continued emigration of between 20,000 and 30,000 people annually during the lifetime of the programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme sets a target of 75,000 jobs.  The last programme surpassed its target although that too was criticised in the House.  I hope this one will.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, through his various agencies have policies outlined in the programme, and the Department of Labour will continue to retain people and give work experience to them to try to get long term unemployed people back into the workforce.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 29, 32, 35 and 69 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1991 Exchequer allocation for the social employment scheme is £57.875 million.  There were 11,715 people on the scheme at the end of January 1991.  Subnational figures are a day to day matter for FÁS and I would suggest to the <Col N="1835" /> Deputy that he contact FÁS directly in the matter.</P>
    <P>Current payment rates, which have been payable since July 1990, are as follows: basic rate, £69 per week; adult dependant allowance, £29.50 per week; and child dependant allowance up to £11 per week.  I propose to have a further review of social employment scheme allowances carried out later this year.</P>
    <P>The additional payments made to those on social employment schemes to which Deputy Mac Giolla refers, are payable to persons in receipt of long term social welfare payments and to persons who are long term unemployed and in receipt of unemployment compensation payments. Participants on the social employment scheme are in receipt of payments which are not directly linked to the unemployment payments they were receiving while they were on the live register.</P>
    <P>The level of payment on the scheme is pitched above that to which such persons would be entitled had they remained on the live register so as to compensate them for the loss of any added benefits payable in addition to the basic social welfare payments.  People on the social employment scheme may engage in other activities while not involved in the scheme and many do.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme is directed at long term unemployed and any reduction in the qualifying period would alter the thrust of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Participants on the social employment scheme are not on the live register while on the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information.  Is it the view in some parts of the country that these schemes are merely updated versions of the public works schemes of the last century?  I accept that in many cases very valuable work has been done that would not otherwise have been done.  Would the Minister consider some sort of monitoring system whereby wasteful schemes of no value would not be commenced?  Will the Minister clarify for the 11,000 who are employed that it is not mandatory that <Col N="1836" /> union dues be deducted before approval can be given for a scheme?  In some parts of the country this has caused controversy and I should like the Minister to clarify the position officially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If any superfluous schemes come to the attention of the monitoring group, which is made up of FÁS, the trade unions and the Department of Labour, such schemes are not renewed.  The only condition is that people must be in receipt of unemployment assistance, be over the age of 25 and have been more than 12 months on the register.  They may also be over the age of 25 and in receipt of unemployment benefit, with the same requirement of 12 months on the register.  There are no grounds for claiming that they should have to pay union dues or any other type of dues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>One final supplementary. Is the Minister satisfied that the allocation of £57 million this year will be sufficient for all the schemes already approved which cannot be commenced because of shortage of funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said that the £57.8 million is Exchequer money. Regardless of some reports, the social employment scheme is still immensely popular.  In recent months there has been a very heavy demand on the scheme. There may be some delay but I hope it will not be too long.  There has been a huge take-up over the past 12 months. Two years ago we had difficulty trying to get people to take up the scheme.  People have found new uses for the scheme which were not there two years ago.  We have to be careful that they are not outside the rules.</P>

      <P>I am very familiar with the policy and the initiatives of the Employment Equality Agency in regard to sexual harassment.  A comprehensive description of the agency's viewpoint is contained in the October 1990 issue of the agency publication <i>Equality News</i>.  I fully share the agency viewpoint that the responsibility lies with employers; I agree, too, with the type of affirmative action which they advise together with the guidelines which they provide to employers on the matter.  The publication of comprehensive guidelines to employers by the FIE represents a further step in the right direction.  I would also like to acknowledge the work of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in this area.  As far back as 1985 the ICTU published guidelines on sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out that as President of the Social Affairs Council of the European Community in the first half of 1990, I drew up and got the Council to adopt a resolution on sexual harassment. The Resolution calls on member states to develop information campaigns and provide awareness of the issues involved. Also the Resolution commits the European Commission to highlighting the protection afforded to workers from sexual harassment by the equality directives of the community.

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and for his support of the affirmative programme as set out by the Employment Equality Agency.  Does the Minister agree that in the work environment there is still a culture of tolerance of the phenomenon <Col N="1838" /> of sexual harassment and does he think there is a necessity for Government to underpin that affirmative action programme, if not by legislation then by some measures short of legislation?  Has the Minister given any thought to that aspect?  Will the Minister tell the House again precisely what facility exists in the case of a woman who successfully takes an action through the Labour Court when the employer appeals that decision through the courts?  What financial assistance is available to such a worker to defend that action in the civil courts?</P>

      <P>I will deal with the second part of the question first.  We have taken the view that where somebody takes an action and financial difficulties prevent that person from pursuing the case the agency and the Department will directly assist.  A number of such cases have occurred.  This has had a remarkable effect on a number of outstanding cases.  I had long been convinced through contact with ICTU and the Employment Equality Agency that it was worth developing an action programme.  We had difficulty initially in convincing some member states of the merits of having a programme to deal with sexual harassment. In the resolution which has been passed member states must actively through Government instruct employers how to deal with the issue of sexual harassment and outline the kind of education which should be given.  There is still a vague attitude to this matter.  People believe it is something which does not happen and that we do not need to pay any attention to it.  Attitudes are changing and that is why so many cases have arisen in the past few years.  At European level and also at local level with ICTU and the FIE we are running a campaign involving counselling information and guidance.  Legislation may not achieve great success in this area. We must try to convince people of the benefits which can accrue from preventing sexual harassment in the workplace. The terms are fairly broad and it covers many difficult and sinister problems in the workplace which we must eliminate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9.</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (3) (c), line 47, to delete &ldquo;appointed under&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;referred to in&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>For discussion purposes we are proposing to take amendments Nos, 9, 10, 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>Section 37 gives power to the Garda Síochána to detain a child who they reasonably suspect is being removed from the State.  The circumstances in which the Garda Síochána will have that power are set out in subsection (1) and where the child is so detained subsection (2) requires the Garda Síochána to return the child as soon as possible to the custodial parent or a health board where the child has been in the care of that health board. It may, however, be necessary in some circumstances to deliver the child into care of a health board for the area in which the child is of the time being where, for example, the custodial parent cannot be found or the custodial parent may be the one who has abducted the child and it would not be appropriate to return the child to that parent and the other parent is not in the country.  In such cases it will be necessary for the health board to apply under subsection (5) at the next sitting of the District Court for directions as to the child's release from such care or otherwise. Subsection (4) requires the health board to give suitable care and accommodation to the child pending the determination of the application at the next sitting of the District Court.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 makes clear that the care and accommodation to be given to the child under subsection (4) may include foster or residential care.  In most cases the period in question should be no more than one or two nights but it could possibly be more depending on the decision of the court or the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1873" /> Amendment No. 11 concerns subsection (5) and ensures that the period between the delivery of the child into the care of the health board and the next sitting of the District Court is kept to an absolute minimum.  The Minister for Justice mentioned on Second Stage that there may be a problem in that during the August, Easter and Christmas vacations the District Courts outside Dublin do not have daily sittings and it may be some days until a sitting of the court is due in a District Court district.  The effect of the amendment is that where the next sitting of the District Court is not due to be held within three days of the date on which the child is delivered into the care of the health board, a special sitting of the District Court will be held within three days.  Deputies may recollect that I made a similar amendment to the Child Care Bill when it was going through this House on Report Stage.  Amendments Nos. 9 and 12 are purely technical and are drafting changes only to subsections (3) (c) and (5).</P>
    <P>I hope the House can agree these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the reasons for the substitution of the words &ldquo;referred to in&rdquo; for &ldquo;appointed under&rdquo;? This suggests that in the future there will be no proposal to appoint a central authority. It was the wish of all on the Opposition side that we should have an appointed central authority headed by somebody who would deal with these types of cases on a regular basis, and that there would be regular contact between members of the Garda Síochána and the health boards so there would be continuity and understanding.  While supporting the Minister's amendment No. 11, which indicates the special consideration we are giving to children in this sad set of circumstances &mdash; the Minister is rightly introducing an amendment, which I accept and support totally, insisting that a court hearing be held within three days &mdash; does it have to be three days?  Could it not be within two days or one day?  One has to take into account the mental anguish of a child, given the <Col N="1874" /> circumstances of abduction, separation from a parent, parents or guardian and, the minimum time of separation should be involved.  Admittedly for administrative reasons it may not be possible to have a court hearing within a shorter period than three days, but I would like to hear the Minister's reasons for selecting a period of three days.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned that we are being asked to delete the words &ldquo;appointed under&rdquo;.  As the Bill stands, I would be happier to see those words retained as distinct from the substitution of the words &ldquo;referred to in&rdquo;.  I would hope that the views expressed by this side of the House on this central authority will be taken on board by the Minister on Report Stage. If the Minister's Administration are not prepared to proceed along the lines that those who sit on this side of the House feel he should, then it should be open to future Governments to have the option to appoint a central authority.  I do not see any benefit being gained in legislative terms by the substitution of the words &ldquo;referred to in&rdquo; for &ldquo;appointed under&rdquo;. I would like to hear the Minister's views on this, and on the three day period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to indicate general agreement with the proposals by way of amendments as suggested by the Minister in this area.  They are sensible and reflect recent higher court decisions with regard to the status of the health board as an authority for the purpose of taking children into care directly.  In addition, they provide good developments in terms of clarifying the sections and insisting upon speed being of the essence for all authorities once a child is taken into custody under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully endorse Deputy Barrett's reservations with regard to the indirect suggestion when we last discussed this on Committee Stage that there is no serious intention on the part of Government to establish an independent autonomous central authority for the purpose of this Bill.  Once the Bill comes into law it is intended that the Minister will retain <Col N="1875" /> within the Department the administrative authority designated to the central authority under these provisions. There is no intention on the part of the Government to introduce a central authority at any stage.  Obviously I would be pressing that that position would not be adopted intractably.  If, as Deputy Barrett suggests, we could be writing that position in in an indirect way, I would obviously share his reservations.  I hope the Minister can reassure us that he is not, directly or indirectly, moving into a position where a central authority could not and would never be appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reassure the House about this situation.  One of the reasons we are making this substitution to delete &ldquo;appointed under&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;refer to in&rdquo; is to ensure that as of now the Department of Justice will be the central authority.  We want to ensure that reserved in the Bill is the right of future Governments or Ministers for Justice to create a central authority if they feel there is a need to do so.  Another reason for the proposed change is to conform with the wording of the convention, and we feel this substitution is closer than what is contained in the convention.  I hope that covers what Deputy McCartan has said.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Barrett's second query, as far as we are concerned we would like the sitting of the District Court to be on the very next day and, if not, then on the second day, but if there is not a sitting on the first or second day then it must be held on the third day. This is in line with the Child Care Bill and we want to standardise the whole legal situation pertaining to the care of children in our country.  Three days is standard in both of these Bills and I hope that that is satisfactory.  We would desire that a sitting would be held as quickly as possible but definitely no later than on the third day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the Minister's point in relation to amendment <Col N="1876" /> No. 9.  He is asking us to substitute the words &ldquo;refer to in&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;appointed under&rdquo;.  I cannot see how that strengthens his resolve to enable a central authority to be appointed in the future. It appears to me to be the direct opposite. I cannot see why we are being asked to delete the words &ldquo;appointed under&rdquo; because they imply an onus to appoint a central authority at some time in the future.  I cannot see how substituting the words &ldquo;referred to in&rdquo; strengthens it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Minister's reply regarding the District Court sitting, would it not be better to imply in the amendment that it is the clear wish of the House that the court case should be heard the following day, but failing that must be heard within three days?  Should we not express the wishes of the House in legislative terms?  We would all agree with the Minister that it is far better that the case be heard the following day but failing that it must be heard within three days.  I would be anxious that it be implied in the wording that that is our wish.  As it stands, it says &ldquo;or, in the event that the next sitting day is not due to be held within three days of the date on which the child is delivered into the care of the health board, at a specially arranged sitting of the District Court held with within the said three days&rdquo;.  Would the Minister look at that for Report Stage to see if he could alter the wording a bit to express in legislative terms what he just said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally the next sitting would mean the next sitting on the very next day and the words &ldquo;next sitting&rdquo; are included there.  The desire is to have the case heard in the District Court on the very next sitting of the court which, hopefully, would be the following day. We are putting in the proviso with regard to a failure to sit on the next or the second next day that it would be mandatory to have a sitting on the third day.  If that flexibility is allowed it would be in everybody's best interest and I hope the House will agree to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Barrett's comments on amendment No. 10, our legal <Col N="1877" /> advice is that if we do not make this substitution we would be tied to one structure.  Making the substitution means that there could be a central authority appointed under the Minister or a central authority appointed by the Minister.  It gives the flexibility to a future Minister to make a change.  We think that is very important and that is what the House desires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position I wish to achieve in moving this amendment is to introduce some element of obligation on the Minister to act under the provision of this Bill as passed.  It might seem a somewhat ridiculous proposition for a legislator standing in the national Parliament to suggest, directly or indirectly, that the fact that we might pass laws in this House does not necessarily mean that we act upon them.  The practice has grown up in the drafting of Bills coming before this House, particularly in the area of the rights of the citizen, whereby we pass the laws in principle, but we are also obliged by the Government of the day to include the proposition that the provisions of the Act will not come into play until the Minister passes an order enforcing it.  There is a number of examples of this outstanding in our legislation. A Bill passed in 1984 in part provided for the video tape recording of interviews of suspects in police custody as and when the Minister would introduce a regulation or an order but, almost seven years later, that provision has not been acted on.  The Child Care Act, which is most directly related to this area of law &mdash; passed in the life of this Dáil &mdash; will not come into effect for a number of months if not years to come.  It is estimated that the financial requirements of that legislation will mean that no Minister will sign an order implementing the provisions of the Child Care Act for one, two, three or more years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time today the Video Recordings Act which was passed more than a year ago has one of its preliminary orders on the Order Paper of the House. I noticed an advertisement in the national <Col N="1880" /> press advising the public that they would be obliged to licence under some of the earlier provisions of the Act but not of the Act in its entirety.  Finally, the incitement to racial hatred legislation has not yet been implemented fully because the ministerial orders have not been made or acted upon.</P>
    <P>A strong tendency is creeping in to much of the legislation we are now passing, in the area of rights of the individual in particular and the regulation of the behaviour of society generally, allowing the Minister to act in the future to bring certain sections into play.  It can be argued that a certain amount of ground work has to be done before the legislation can operate.  I would much prefer to see that addressed by means of a deadline in the legislation when it is debated in the Dáil, along the lines that the Act shall not come into effect until a certain number of days or months have elapsed.  The Minister would have a certain amount of breathing space in which to operate from the time of the passing of the Bill to its implementation.</P>
    <P>The formula contained in section 41, and in earlier sections in regard to regulations generally and the establishment of a central authority is not acceptable because of the use of the permissive obnoxious word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Section 41 states that the Minister may make regulations for the purposes of giving effect to the Act but the immediate logical corollary of that is that the Minister may not make regulations.  That is, unfortunately, what is happening all too often.</P>
    <P>While this House gives permission tardy, sloppy, lazy Departments and Ministers do not take up our invitation and do not act on the legislation put on the Statute Book.  I instanced a number of them.  All kinds of reasons, developments and changes in the climate, political or otherwise, outside are availed of subsequent to this House passing a Bill into law as to why certain provisions, if not all the provisions of a Bill, should not be acted upon by the Minister of the day.  I do not think that is satisfactory.  It is demeaning of the procedures of this House that we are asked to spend our <Col N="1881" /> time and energies legislating and find subsequently that a Minister without the gumption, the courage or the political decisiveness of the day may change his or her mind and say, &ldquo;While that may have been the situation as pertained in the House on 27 February 1991, things have moved on and have changed&rdquo;.  The way to deal with that is to bring back amending legislation and ask this House to change its collective legislative mind. It is not good legislative practice.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of amendment No. 13 I suggest we take out this obnoxious word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute it with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;; in other words making it obligatory on the Minister to introduce regulations and to do so within six months of the passing into law of this Bill.  In considering the drafting and preparation that goes into presenting this legislation to the House there is ample time within six months of a Bill passing into law, for a Minister to take what steps are necessary to give effect to the law.</P>
    <P>The second amendment, No. 14, in my name on behalf of The Workers' Party, suggests that it is desirable, if not obligatory, that any regulations to be made by the Minister, in bringing this statute into law, should be laid before this House and not passed into law untill a motion affirming them is passed.  In other words, it gives this House the opportunity to review and to let its voice be known with regard to any regulations drafted for the purpose of giving effect to the law.  This is another undemocratic and anti-legislator provision that is all too often and easily relied upon.  Much of the nuts and bolts of legislation is left out of Bills and left over to a day when a Minister, and his officials, have time to put regulations together and that is the last we see of it.  Very important provisions about the workability, the implications and accessibility of legislation are left aside for the purposes of regulations and this House, in practice, never get an opportunity to take any action or to do or say anything about those regulations once published and laid before the House in the form of the negative motion of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The need for this matter to be <Col N="1882" /> addressed is doubly necessary in the context of this type of legislation where the general construction of it is simply to have a number of preliminary sections that do no more than bring into play the terms of an international agreed convention. The convention is given the effect of law by the earlier sections we have almost disposed of.</P>
    <P>Consequently, a whole area is hardly addressed at all in the consideration of the legislation.  We are asked to look at the preliminary sections and the way in which the Minister proposes to implement the convention but the convention is not open to amendment.  I cannot, for example, in the course of this debate suggest we turn to page 27 of the Bill and amend Article 38 at line 10 because it contains a wrong provision.  I cannot do that because this is not legislation but rather the implementation into domestic law directly of an internationally agreed convention, using language, ideas and structures which are often alien and unsuited to the domestic situation.  We are trying to work in this type of formula of bringing in a international agreement into domestic law. The Minister is working to introduce legislation to make that whole mishmash operate but it is important that we have an opportunity at some stage to review those regulations once they are drafted. For those reasons I hope the Minister will accept that my amendments are reasonable and based upon genuine fear for the legislative process under which we are asked to operate in bringing this Bill before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The fear expressed by Deputy McCartan is shared by a number of people on this side of the House because of our experience in recent years.  As Deputy McCartan has said, there have been instances where regulations have not been made to bring parts of an Act into being which, in my opinion, showed total disrespect for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These are supposed to be the Chambers where laws are made.  Of course, it is far more convenient for a Department and Minister to have plenty <Col N="1883" /> of scope to do things, but we are the people who are answerable at the end of the day.  People will rightly point to us and say &ldquo;You are the people who make the laws, so why do you not implement them?&rdquo;  We will have to reply &ldquo;When we passed that law it made provision that the Minister would have to make regulations for that section to come into force but he has not made those regulations yet&rdquo;.  This leads me to ask are we really a law making Assembly?</P>
      <P>For that reason I support the principle of Deputy McCartan's amendment. There may be exceptional circumstances where for one reason or another it would be practically impossible to bring all regulations into being within six months.  I can think of rare occasions where negotiations would be continuing and it would be in the common good that a decision should be postponed for a month or two. However, if that is going to be the case, an obligation should be imposed on the Minister, if he has not made the regulations, to come back here within six months and explain the reason for the delay.</P>
      <P>To answer any possible criticism of Deputy McCartan's amendment, perhaps the Minister would accept the principle of the amendment and provide that regulations shall be brought into being within six months of the passing into law of this Bill, unless approval to the contrary has been sought and got from both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That would be a reasonable extension to the principle Deputy McCartan's has expounded here today.  While I agree with the principle of his amendment, I would make allowance for the rare occasions when it might not be possible for the Minister to bring regulations into being within a period of six months.  The Minister can cover himself in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider Deputy McCartan's amendment and the point I have made &mdash; unless the Minister gets the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, all the regulations will have to be made within a period of, say, six months.  As I said, this would mean the <Col N="1884" /> Minister would have to come back to both Houses of the Oireachtas, who are supposed to be the law making bodies, to explain why it was not possible to make the regulations within the set period.  I do not think it is acceptable for us to pass a law and leave it to the Minister to decide when to bring in the regulations.  We will not have a clue when he will bring them in.</P>
    <P>When I was Fine Gael spokesperson on Justice in 1987 and 1988 I dealt with the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  One of the sections in that Act dealt with the sale of alcohol in supermarkets.  The regulations governing that issue have not yet been brought into being, three years later, and there is no obligation on the Minister to come back here and explain why.  Various people have asked me why something has not been done in this area as it was dealt with in the 1988 Intoxicating Liquor Act. The same situation exists in relation to the Video Recordings Act, which I again dealt with during 1987-89.</P>

      <P>There are numerous sections of Acts which were to come into being by way of regulation, but that was the last we have heard of them.  Even though these regulations may relate to an exceptional part of a Bill we have no right to insist that they will be brought into being.</P>
      <P>I support the principle of Deputy McCartan's amendment.  Perhaps the Deputy will consider my proposal to give the Minister some leeway &mdash; if it is not possible for him to introduce the regulations within a period of six months he should come back here to explain why and seek an extension of a further three or six months.  It is important that the Minister, whoever he is, respects both this Chamber and the Upper House, the Assemblies where our laws are made.  We should not give powers to a Minister who may never bring a certain section of an Act into being, without putting an obligation on him to answer to both Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by my colleagues on this side of the House.  We have had many sad experiences in regard to the introduction of regulations in the social welfare area. Very often we only find out what is happening in the areas of social welfare and health when people come to our clinics or offices to complain about their problems.</P>
      <P>The current trend is to include the meat of the legislation in the regulations rather than in the Bill.  This is an unfortunate development.  A copy of the regulations is placed in the Library and the Members who are involved in the enactment of the legislation have no input into the regulations. We do not know what will be in the regulations as we are not consulted. Professional bodies, the Garda Síochána and various State and semi-State organisations may or may not be consulted about the drafting of the regulations.  At the end of the day the officials in the Department or the Minister may not have to consult any other organisations or individual about the regulations. Members on all sides have expressed concern about this development.  As I said, this is the general trend in all legislation. I presume the current policy is to get legislation through the House and to introduce the real meat by way of regulation at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation emanating from the Department of Justice will have serious effects on the population at large at one stage or another.  The vast bulk of the decisions in regard to the Judiciary will be dealt with in regulations rather than legislation.  In the normal course of events legislation emanating from the Department of Justice will not be circulated to members of the Garda Síochána.  Deputy McCartan knows the process much better than I but I assume, for example, a member of the Garda Síochána will have to go to a library &mdash; maybe not the Oireachtas Library &mdash; or some central area where copies of regulations can be secured.  Legislation has to be dealt with by the Garda Síochána who will not be, in many cases, familiar with these regulations. As Deputy Barrett said, in many <Col N="1886" /> cases very relevant and important sections of legislation are never put into operation because the regulations are not made or are delayed for perhaps years. The main thrust of the amendments should be accepted.  I support Deputy Barrett's suggestion that some method should be found whereby this matter can be tightened up or controlled other than by simply saying the regulations will lay down virtually everything that is in the legislation.  I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the three contributions of my colleagues.  I think the Deputies are confusing the giving of effect to the Act and the coming into effect of the Act.  The Act will come into effect automatically following the deposit of the instruments of ratification of both of the international conventions in question.  The arrangements for the depositing of our instruments of ratification will be made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs after due consultation with the Government as quickly as possible after the Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>I have listened with interest to what the Deputies have said, particularly to what Deputy McCartan has said.  There is no point in us as legislators pumping out misinformation to the people of this country.  Deputy McCartan talked about the Child Care Bill which was passed after one full year in Committee.  It came into this House and was passed with several amendments, and it is now getting its Second Reading in Seanad Éireann. As a commitment to the enactment of that Bill the Government allocated in the budget £1 million towards its implementation in 1991.  Surely that can be seen as a commitment by legislators of this House to create law and by the Government to accepting the will of the House and providing resources for it.  There is no question of postponing the implementation of any part of the Child Care Bill. We are totally committed to child care legislation, to modern legislation, and we will continue to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the privilege for the past eight years of being a Member of this <Col N="1887" /> House.  I spent four years on that side of the House and I am fortunate enough to be four years on this side.  I have seen Ministers, Ministers of State and Governments at work during that time and I have the utmost regard for all office holders. They come in here and bring forward the best legislation possible, put it into law and provide the necessary resources. There is a particular type of structure within which Governments and legislators operate and it has not failed the country as yet.  We must ensure that the facts are given to the people, that they know we are committed to providing proper legislation and that we work in that area consistently and in a positive way.  That goes for all sides of the House and all Members of the House.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 13, there are good and valid reasons for enabling the Minister to make regulations under the Act if he so wishes rather than making it a requirement to do so.  The regulations concern forms that may be prescribed in relation to applications to the central authority under The Hague Convention for return of a child who is removed firstly, to the State under section 8 or, secondly, from the State under section 9, or in relation to applications under the Luxembourg Convention for recognition and enforcement of a custody decision in the State under section 24, or in another contracting state under section 32.  A model form for applications under The Hague Convention and the Luxembourg Convention has been designed on a nonobligatory basis, that is, states are not strictly required to make use of this model form.  The stated reasons are, firstly, that adaptations of the form should be a matter for agreement between the relevant central authorities and secondly, there may be inconsistencies between different states' forms because of language and other technical difficulties.</P>
    <P>Against this background, it would be better to have as much flexibility as possible in relation to the making of forms of application under our legislation.  For that reason it might be best not to make the regulations formally until we have <Col N="1888" /> experience of the operation of the conventions. That is not to say that we will not have pre-printed forms available when the conventions come into force in the State, on the contrary, it is proposed to have application forms printed, whether on the basis of regulations or not.  The date or dates of the ratification of the conventions by Ireland will in effect determine the date or dates of the coming into force of the Act or different parts of it.  This is very clear.  Consequently, I regret I will not be able to accept amendment No. 13.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will be guided by you if you want me to respond to amendment No. 14 at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the need to put before the Houses of the Oireachtas for formal approval a matter of this kind.  In questions only are forms which prescribe the details to be included in applications under The Hague or Luxembourg Conventions.  Any such forms will be simple and straigtforward and to involve the Houses of the Oireachtas in examination of those forms would be wasteful of their time.  I am satisfied that the best way to approach the matter is the standard approach in these matters as provided for in section 42.</P>
      <P>In any event, Deputy McCartan's amendment is technically flawed in that insertion of the subsection he proposes together with the deletion of section 42, which he also proposes, would mean there would be no provision in the Bill for the laying of orders made by the Minister for Justice before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>No regulations are required in order to give effect to the legislation because in this case we are dealing with international conventions. <Col N="1889" /> The process of the implementation of the legislation is different from that of ordinary domestic legislation.  I wonder if various Ministers were coming in here day after day and week after week discussing and debating regulations how committed we would be to them and how satisfied would we be with that type of process of evolving the rules and regulations pertaining to law that we pass here?  If that were the case we would receive many complaints.  The people outside as well as Members of the House would say we would be better employed discussing and debating legislation in the broader sense rather than in a very technical perusal-type way.  I want to make clear that there will be no delay in implementing the Act because of the absence of regulations since the Act does not require regulations to be made.  Consequently, I regret that I cannot accept these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I pursue the matter, I would ask the Minister if he can give an indication as to when the Government might lodge their letters of ratification to the conventions?  What does he envisage will be the time period? I am fully prepared to accept the assurances he has given that there will be no delay once the ratification of the conventions has taken place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that, given the co-operation of the Whips in both this House and in the Seanad, we will get this Bill through both Houses as quickly as possible.  Immediately thereafter, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will prepare his memorandum for Government who will have it cleared and we will then lodge them as quickly as we can.  The Deputy can be certain it will be done in 1991 and not in two or three years' time, as he suggested earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested that in respect of other legislation and I do not share the Minister's confidence in that regard, even though he said certain budgetary allocations have been made. However, to deal more directly with the <Col N="1890" /> legislation before us, I am not at all happy with the Minister's response in regard, firstly, to the technical difficulty he talked about.  If my amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are accepted there will be no necessity for section 42, and that is why I oppose it. I do not see where this technical problem arises in terms of the construction referred to by the Minister.  Obviously there would be some difficulty with amendment No. 14 on its own, but if it is taken in conjunction with amendment No. 13 the matter would be adequately covered.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about the effect of misinformation being disseminated with regard to what is happening.  It is quite clear that, for Ireland to be joined in international law as a party to the conventions, it must lodge letters of ratification and sign the convention on the dotted line.  I accept that but the purpose of the legislation before the House is to bring those specific provisions out of the arena of international law and introduce them to domestic law.  Therefore, there is a very real difference and extension of the matter beyond simply lodging letters of ratification.  There are many conventions in international law, of which Ireland is a party, which have not been introduced to the domestic corpus of law. They have effect in our law simply on the basis that we are contracting parties, nation between nation, but the purpose of this Bill &mdash; if the Minister looks at the explanatory memorandum &mdash; is to give force of law in the State to the two conventions. Therefore, there is a bit more to the legislation than mere ratification of an international convention.  I do not know whether the Minister is worried about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the making of regulations is reduced to nothing more than drafting and making available forms for the working of the legislation?  If that is the assurance he is giving to the House, is it all he envisages being included in the regulations?  If so, perhaps I should not be unduly worried. I put it to the Minister that, ultimately, there will be a lot more to be dealt with in the regulations when they come to be <Col N="1891" /> drafted.  I want to remind him of the rather unusual order of things at present: an international convention is being introduced to domestic law by enabling legislation which has its own framework and limited provisions and I have no doubt that, when the draftsman in the Department tries to make all this work, there will be very substantial outstanding matters which will be covered in the regulations. There is nothing, in short, in the section which says that the regulations will be able to deal with the drafting of forms or the setting of purely administrative matters for the implementation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that, in the Child Care Bill and other legislation where regulations were referred to, they are often accompanied by subsections which say, in general terms, what the regulations shall cover.  There is no indication of that here; there is a writ at large to the Minister to make regulations, as the section says, &ldquo;for the purpose of giving effect to the Act&rdquo;.  On reasonable reflection, having looked at the complexities of the provisions of the convention, and in view of the fact that they involve language, ideas and structures which are not of our domestic nature, it is clear that there will be far more substantial matters to be dealt with in the regulations than the Minister is suggesting here, in the area of form producing only.  If the Minister says that there is not &mdash; I have no doubt that, as a result of consultations with his officials, there are some broad indications even at this stage as to what the regulations should cover, that the regulations will not have a wider brief and effect &mdash; then perhaps I should not be as upset as I might be in pressing this point.  If that indication is there, I may have something else to say about the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points involved: the first is the making of regulations and the timespan in which those regulations should be made; the second point is that, having made the regulations, whether they should ultimately <Col N="1892" /> come before both Houses of the Oireachtas for ratification.  Should they just be laid in the Library?</P>
      <P>I recognise that section 42 also refers to every order or regulation so there is a technical difficulty in relation to opposing the section.  In certain Bills I sought to have a standard wording amended so that regulations will be brought before this House for debate before they are formally adopted, and it is important in legislation to have the opportunity to discuss regulations.</P>
      <P>I recall, in relation to the Intoxicating Liquor Act, that we succeeded in persuading the then Minister that the regulations in relation to the licensing of restaurants should be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas for confirmation. However, we suddenly discovered that while we could look at the regulations and debate them, we could not amend them, which makes a joke of the whole thing.  The effect of the long debate we had on licensing restaurants, the need for this and the aviailability, from a tourist point of view, of having alcohol available in restaurants with a meal &mdash; we reached a general compromise and agreement as to how, where and when a restaurant could have a licence &mdash; was that the Minister for Tourism introduced a whole set of regulations which would make it practically impossible for anyone to get a restaurant licence.  This was totally contrary to the debate we had here in the first place with the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I questioned the Taoiseach earlier today about the need for Dáil reform and I highlighted what is going on here.  We are living in an outdated, outmoded system which was cobbled together by the British in the last century; we are trying to apply the same rules and regulations today as we did 100 years ago.  If we cannot move forward, in God's name, we can encourage the people we represent to move forward to meet the challenges of 1992?  Every time a Member of the House argues that sort of point we are now discussing we get the standard reply and the reasons for not doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parliamentary democracy is not the <Col N="1893" /> most convenient system, it is a bit cumbersome and awkward, particularly in Government.  Ministers feel that they have better things to do than traipsing in here to account for their stewardship in front of the other Members of the House. However, in the interests of parliamentary democracy, it is vitally important that there are times when a Minister &mdash; and a Government &mdash; should be asked to explain the long delay in bringing in sections of a Bill or regulations in regard to an Act which were agreed and debated perhaps two or three years previously.  I do not consider that the time of this House would be wasted in doing that and I was surprised to hear the Minister saying that time would be wasted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quoting the Minister exactly, but he said that time would be wasted and that we have better things to do.  The Minister can quote what he said later but he certainly implied that. We do not want to waste time and if it is a standard procedure, all the Minister has to do is to announce, after the Order of Business, that, through agreement between the Whips, a motion in relation to the extension of the period for making regulations under a certain Act is hereby agreed.  There need not be a debate but there must always be a watchdog.</P>
      <P>I should like to debate with the Minister for Justice or the Minister of State why parts of the Intoxicating Liquor Act are not in place.  That Bill was passed over two years ago and I recall, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that you were engrossed in the debate over licensing and all sorts of aspects of the Bill.  You recall what I am talking about, and some sections of that Act are not yet in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is a great man for rules and regulations and rightly so because that is the job he is asked to do in the House.  I am sure, having the same type of mind as I on these issues, he would like to know exactly why that has happened. That is why we are, through this amendment, seeking the safeguards for this <Col N="1894" /> House that Ministers should be answerable. After a given period of time they should come here and say why such and such a regulation or Part of an Act has not been brought into being.  In this legislation that may not be as important as it would be in other legislation but it would do no harm.  It will not destroy the legislation. It is not, as is said, a &ldquo;mortaler&rdquo;.  It is not imposing further expenditure on the State or anything of that nature; it is asking, perhaps, that the Minister be inconvenienced a little.  I see nothing wrong with that.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has a satisfactory answer to the points being made, and if Deputy McCartan is not pressing his amendment, so be it.  If Deputy McCartan wishes to press this amendment he will have my support on the basis of defending a principle.  Other Departments, and other Ministers, should be aware that it is the wish of this House that in certain circumstances they should come back here to explain why certain things have not been done that were implied in the legislation and could have been debated two or three years ago.  The choice is the Minister's.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by what I said.  He is making me slightly nervous too with his invitation to Deputy McCartan to press his amendment.  I assure Deputy McCartan, and the House, that the regulations will merely deal with forms to be used in connection with application under the conventions.  Sections 9, 10, 24 and 32 indicate that the forms to be used may be as prescribed.  &ldquo;Prescribed&rdquo; is defined in section 2.  Deputy Barrett is very accurate in his reference to section 42 which provides that &ldquo;every order or regulation made by the Minister under this Act...&rdquo; The difficulty arose in Deputy McCartan's amendment in that it referred to regulations but did not include &ldquo;order&rdquo;. consequently, it was flawed on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1895" /> Section 1 (3) is a standard commencement provision.  The date or dates of the ratification of the conventions for Ireland will in effect determine the date or dates of the coming into force of the Bill or different parts of the Bill.  The Hague Convention will come into force for Ireland on the first day of the third calendar month after the deposit of our instrument of ratification under Article 43.1.  The Luxembourg Convention will come into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of three months after the date of the deposit of our instrument of ratification, Article 22.2.  Therefore, the coming into effect of this Bill is laid down in regulations and automatically falls on a particular date from once we lodge the necessary instrument of ratification. Consequently, there should be no doubt about that.  We do not want to delay it. We appreciate the co-operation of the House and the positive sincerity expressed by Members participating in the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confused and would like clarification.  I take the point with regard to the omission in my amendment No. 14 with reference to orders, and I will be able to correct that on Report Stage.  I am not sure what the Minister was referring to in respect of the various dates as to when the conventions will come into operation.  There is a difference. What he was quoting referred to when the conventions will become a matter for international law once signed and ratified by the Irish Government and how many months after the lodgement of letters of ratification it becomes a matter of international law and obligation for us. In other words, how we address nationals of other countries who seek redress under the conventions and our obligations abroad.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister deal with section 1 (3)?  It states,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister <Col N="1896" /> shall fix by order or orders either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different provisions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, for domestic purposes the Bill will not come into operation here until the Minister for Justice makes an order under it.  Two separate events, so to speak, are occurring.  As a matter of international law and obligation for Ireland the operative date will be fixed from the date of the lodgment of the letters of ratification, but from the matter of the implementation and workability of this legislation at home it does not become law until the Minister makes orders.  That is where I am a little confused.  This needs clarification before we pass on from it.</P>
    <P>I should say, in deference to what Deputy Barrett said, and I did not take the opportunity of responding to it, that his suggestion of an addendum to amendment No. 13 is very good and fair.  As a matter of principle, if there is substance in these regulations then a time limit should be fixed on it and, if necessary, let the Minister seek the permission of the Dáil as we are the prime motivators of the legislation &mdash; the legislation was initiated here &mdash; rather than going to the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  I suggest we agree that it should come back before at least the Dáil for further extension.  That is a very workable compromise in the circumstances if there is substance in what the regulations imply.</P>

We must discharge our <Col N="1897" /> obligation both domestically and internationally under the conventions.  Consequently, the Minister for Justice will have to bring in an order to coincide with the dates under both conventions.  They will get international ratification by us once we lodge the necessary instruments.  The dates will coincide with our lodgments and fall into line with obligations under both conventions so there will be no delay.  We are absolutely committed.  We want to discharge our obligations both nationally and internationally, and I hope the House is satisfied with that.</P>

      <P>I had tabled a general point of opposition to this section to be taken in the context of amendments Nos. 13 and 14.  Clearly, I cannot now ask the House to oppose or delete section 42 and put nothing in its place.  My combined formula was the proposal of laying regulations before the House and that they become the force of law simply by default, so to speak.  If no motion was moved to annul them they would become law after 21 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In principle, The Workers' Party are opposed to that formula as a way of dealing with regulations.  However, I had intended earlier to ask the House to <Col N="1898" /> accept the proposition of the positive regulation under my amendment No. 14 which has not been moved.  In those circumstances I am not pressing my opposition to section 42 as it now stands other than to say that as a matter of principle it is the type of provision we would, by and large, oppose because we believe it is undemocratic and not what this parliamentary Assembly should expect from our legislators.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 18, before section 43, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;43. &mdash; (1)  Persons making application to the Central Authority and/or the courts under the provisions of this Act shall be entitled to apply for and be granted, where appropriate, legal advice and assistance in the preparation and prosecution of such applications.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister shall make regulations, under section 41 of this Act, to provide for the extension of the legal aid system to cover such applications.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I propose to insert a new section 43 in which case the present section 43 will become section 44.  I am proposing to include in the legislation an assertion of the right to legal aid by anyone who seeks recourse under the Bill either in approaching the central authority or in approaching the courts.  I propose that:</P>
      <P>Persons making application to the Central Authority and/or the courts under the provisions of this Act shall be entitled to apply for and be granted, where appropriate, legal advice and assistance in the preparation and prosecution of such applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Minister shall make regulations, under section 41 of this Act, to provide for the extension of the legal <Col N="1899" /> aid system to cover such applications.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is important that we underscore the fact that legal aid be available to all who seek recourse to the law under the provisions of the convention and the Act. Situations can often occur where children and their safety and security are abused in circumstances of extraordinary trauma and people cannot be expected to stop and think about the potential cost in money terms if they are to pursue their children from one country to another to try to restore them to the safety of a family.  It is right that the Convention has regard to the right of all applicants to legal aid under the terms of the Convention. That is only fair when one considers that we will have people moving from one jurisdiction to another where they will not necessarily understand the prosecution and processing of an application under this Bill and would need to fall back on the use of lawyers.  It is important that there is not any inhibition on them in relation to legal aid in these circumstances. The Convention which we are proposing to bring into our domestic law with the passing of this Bill provides for legal aid to be made available.  Article 42 of the Hague Convention reads:</P>
    <P>Any State may, not later than the time of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or at the time of making a declaration in terms of Article 39 or 40, make one or both of the reservations provided for in Article 24 and Article 26, third paragraph.  No other reservation shall be permitted.</P>
    <P>I am quoting the Article of the Convention that allows Governments to make reservations under the terms of the Convention.  The provisions with regard to legal aid are contained in Article 26 where it says:</P>
    <P>Central Authorities and other public services of Contracting States shall not impose any charges in relation to applications submitted under this Convention. In particular, they may not <Col N="1900" /> require any payment from the applicant towards the costs and expenses of the proceedings or, where applicable, those arising from the participation of legal counsel or advisers.  However, they may require the payment of the expenses incurred or to be incurred in implementing the return of the child.</P>
    <P>However, a Contracting State may, by making a reservation in accordance with Article 42, declare that it shall not be bound to assume any costs referred to in the preceding paragraph resulting from the participation of legal counsel or advisers or from court proceedings, except in so far as those costs may be covered by its system of legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>There is a declaration there that the contracting states should provide legal aid and advice to the extent to which it exists under our current scheme.  Taken in conjunction with Article 42, there is authority for the State to enter reservations. It is because of that facility and the provisions of Article 42 that the Irish Government can contract their way out of their obligations in respect of this.  We had a poor showing in previous international litigation particularly in our response to the Airey case where Ireland entered a very meagre response to the European Convention by saying that we were required to provide legal aid and assistance from what currently existed. At that time that was very little, if anything at all.  Since the response to the Airey case and the entering of the reservation to the European Convention our performance generally with regard to the provision of legal aid has been less than satisfactory.  I have a real worry that while the Convention is there, there may not be a wholehearted willingness on the part of the Government to give the fullest aid, assistance and advice to people from other countries who come here and seek to avail of the terms of the provision and make applications to either the central authority or to the courts under this Bill. It is important that we put into the legislation a provision saying that there shall be legal aid and advice available and that <Col N="1901" /> the Minister shall make regulations to extend the legal aid scheme to accommodate these applications.  Under the legal aid scheme as it currently exists these applications would not qualify. They are not covered under any of the general areas of law currently provided for under the general legal aid scheme which does not have a statutory base. When the legal aid scheme was established these types of applications were not envisaged.  We are now bringing into domestic law, under international contact, the provisions of the Hague and Luxembourg Conventions and we need clarity and to know that our legal aid system will be extended to cover these applications.  That is the importance of subsection (2).</P>
    <P>The central point in my amendment to insert this new section is that the House will declare clearly and unambiguously that legal aid will be available to all persons under the Bill.  My reason for putting the amendment is our rather poor history in meeting legal aid requirements generally and because a provision exists in the Convention to allow Ireland to reserve its duties under Article 26 by availing of the reservation provisions under Article 42.  It is important that we cut off the Government from that avenue.  I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment without quibble because it reflects what the Minister seemed to indicate to this House on Second Stage.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment I hope he will say that this point is covered in the Convention and that there is not a need for it.  In anticipation of that response I suggest that the amendment should be added in because it will not take away from the legislation or from what the Minister intends to do.</P>
    <P>I hope the amendment will be acceptable and that the House will put down a marker in the from of this amendment that legal aid will be available and that there will be no derogation from that position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 26 of The Hague Convention which is being made <Col N="1902" /> part of the law of the State prevents the imposition of charges in relation to applications submitted under the convention. It goes on to provide that there may be no requirement of payment from the applicant towards the costs and expenses of the proceedings for the return of a child or, where applicable, those arising from the participation of legal counsel or advisers.  Although there is the possibility of a reservation so as to allow states to apply strictly the conditions of their legal aid schemes, it is not intended to make that reservation.</P>
      <P>Article 5 of the Luxembourg Convention also provides that each contracting state undertakes not to claim any payment from the applicant in respect of measures taken by the central authority on behalf of the applicant under the convention including the costs of proceedings and, where applicable, the costs incurred by the assistance of a lawyer.</P>
      <P>There is no possibility of a reservation. In other words, under the provisions of both conventions the applicant will be entitled automatically to legal aid and advice irrespective of means.  The civil legal aid scheme already contains the necessary provision in paragraph 3.2.6 of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme of civil legal aid and advice was laid by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Gerry Collins, before each House of the Oireachtas in December 1979.  Paragraph 3.2.6 of the scheme states:</P>
      <P>3.2.6.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Scheme the Board may grant a certificate where it is satisfied that the application is concerned with a matter in respect of which the State has a duty to provide civil legal aid under an international instrument which specifically states that the State is obliged to provide such aid and the requirements, if any, to be satisfied by such an applicant in connection with the grant of a certificate will be determined on the basis of the requirements of the international instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That paragraph was inserted in the <Col N="1903" /> scheme with the obligations arising from both conventions particularly in mind.</P>
    <P>The reference to the making of regulations to extend the civil legal aid scheme is, therefore, not necessary nor is it appropriate.  The scheme is still an administrative scheme, though we should be considering draft legislation to put it on a statutory basis later in this year.  The absence of legislation is not an impediment to the operation of the scheme.  It does not affect the position so far as obligations under these conventions are concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope this clarifies the position for the House and that Deputy McCartan is happy with what I have said.  I regret I will not be able to accept this amendment. Perhaps he will withdraw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In advance of making any final decision on the amendment, could the Minister clarify the State's attitude with regard to Article 42 and any derogations?  I was momentarily distracted when the Minister was dealing with that point.  I am particularly concerned about Article 42 of The Hague Convention and the possibilities afforded for Government to enter reservations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intention by the Government to make a reservation under Article 42, even though the convention does allow for a reservation to be placed.  I hope this clarifies the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that.  I have difficulty getting the full meaning of Article 42.  This is one of the difficulties we have in taking international conventions into our own legislation without the work of our own draftsmen.  My reading of it would suggest that when the State is making a declaration in terms of Article 39 or Article 40 it may make one or both of the reservations provided for in Article 24 and Article 26.  There is no intention on the part of the Government in ratifying the Convention to enter a reservation but I am not sure if that cuts off the possibility of such a reservation being entered in the future, thereby changing <Col N="1904" /> our commitment to the concept of legal aid as provided under Article 26.3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 42 is reasonably clear.  It states that any State may, not later than the time of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession or at the time of making a declaration in terms of Article 39 or 40, make one or both of the reservations provided for in Article 24 and Article 26.3.  No other reservation shall be permitted.  That means that any reservation on behalf of Ireland may be lodged when we lodge our instruments of ratification.  If we do not put down a reservation at that time, which we have no intention of doing, no subsequent Government can enter any reservation on behalf of Ireland.</P>

How will the farming community and people <Col N="1908" /> in agriculture become aware that they are breaking the law?  Will they be advised through newspaper articles, or the farming press, or something like that? Everybody should be clearly aware of when he may contravene the Bill rather than pleading ignorance under the law, which is not a defence at all, we are told.

As I have said &mdash; and I think it is a reasonable point &mdash; should the proposal to close up to 554 sub-post offices be implemented, the ability of people to come across this information will be greatly reduced.  When one goes into a post office or a Garda barracks one sees lots of notices from the one telling people to get on with paying their television licences to the one about ragwort.  Some of them have been there for years.  We should now use the other media to get messages like this across in a modern way.  We have teletext on television and information like that could easily be got across in a more effective way than by the old practices of the past, where one generally did not know about such notices until one was told by word of mouth.  I am sure the Minister agrees with that argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice of the Attorney General is that it was necessary to bring forward this section to update it and to rectify an omission in the Principal Act.  It is primarily on his advice that this section was brought forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, first, apologies to the House for my failure to be here to move my amendment. Since the monitors in No. 16 Molesworth Street are out of order, I was not aware that the Bill was in progress.  I can move that amendment at Report Stage.  I take it we are discussing section 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about section 3 which deals with organic farmers.  There are draconian regulations here regarding compulsory spraying; many of these sprays are against the principles of organic farming.  We would be very concerned that the inconvenience to organic farmers might be so great &mdash; they get a premium price for their product &mdash; that where there is a compulsory spraying order, financial compensation should be given to them for the period for which they will lose their organic status.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy has in mind or what sort of practical suggestion he wants to make that we could bring forward to meet the point he has made.  As I am sure he is aware, the Government are very committed to the whole concept of organic farming and have been making very significant financial provisions to encourage that sector. The demand for organic produce is growing and we are endeavouring to encourage it as best we can.  The necessary research and development work and the co-ordination of the different interests in the sector is under way.  We have a new organic unit in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  At the same time, when it comes to the control of diseases which could have serious implications for the production base, whether in the area of organic production or in conventional production, it will be necessary to have the means and the wherewithal to deal with it.  That is basically what we are talking about in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appreciate if the Minister would elaborate on the information the farmer would be obliged to give when it comes to the spraying notice. Can the Minister explain whether the penalties cover the misuse and misapplication of these dangerous and often toxic spray chemicals?  Is the Minister aware that if the food chain is endangered by misuse or misapplication of these sprays, the wildlife and bird life which eat these infected or oversprayed crops <Col N="1912" /> are threatened?  What are the penalties to compel the farmer or the agricultural contractor to comply with the safe application of sprays in their proper mixes or proper densities?  Are penalties built into this Bill to penalise people who misuse and misapply, to a dangerous degree, these potentially dangerous and toxic chemicals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially the legislation is providing for cases of non-compliance which the notices and conditions lay down.  The Deputy may be endeavouring to broaden the area of discussion under the Bill.  I must emphasise that the legislation caters for non-compliance in the areas which the Deputy is talking about. I hope the provisions of the Bill will deal with any misgivings he may have in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful to remind the House &mdash; as Deputy Kavanagh did on Second Stage &mdash; that the Principal Act was passed in 1958.  The world we lived in then was very simple; sprays and chemicals of all kinds were seen as being a great improvement in agriculture. Now, many of us see these sprays in a different light.  It must be said that in some cases the cure may be worse than the disease.  When there is a problem of potato blight, or some other disease, I wonder whether we should not use a spray which is particularly dangerous, but let nature take its course.  This legislation is now 32 years old and I suggest that this whole area needs to be reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point the Deputy is making.  In consideration of a greater awareness of the importance of and the protection of the environment, various legislation which will touch on this area will, over a period, have to be reviewed to ensure that it is in conformity with what is best for the environment.  This is something we could discuss on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes without saying that the appreciation of the Members of the House and the public generally of the changed approach and the changed attitude to the <Col N="1913" /> protection of the environment is such that legislation which may seem out of date will, over a period, have to be considered in the different areas which it directly affects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I suffer from the difficulty that I was not Spokesperson on Agriculture when the Second Stage was discussed last November. Some of the Deputies here have a similar problem.  It appears that this section deals almost specifically with insecticides which might be used in the control of pests which affect the potato crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good example.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>What has happened since 1958 when the original Act was passed that has necessitated this amendment? The traditional way of spraying potatoes was by using a substance called bluestone or crystalline copper sulphate dissolved in water and sprayed on &mdash; Deputy Foxe would be the expert in that area. Recently the process has been considerably changed and there are now a number of sprays which are considered to be more effective than bluestone, the most common being dithane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Garland asked the extremely important question as to whether we are sure that these sprays are harmless. Despite the fact that I was Minister for Agriculture for over four years, I am not altogether familiar with the pesticide section of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I believe all Members would like to be assured that that section in the Department are totally competent in deciding what types of spray are safe.  If they are not totally satisfied as to what sprays are safe to whom do they refer them?  Are there laboratories, testing facilities or experimental facilities in this country to which they can send the sprays so that they can be satisfied that they cannot be harmful in any manner?  It is well known that some common sprays, for example, DDT, which were used many years ago are not used now.  These sprays which were regarded as completely safe in years gone by have been <Col N="1914" /> found in recent years not to be safe.  What depth of research has been undertaken in regard to these sprays?  To what bodies do the Department send sprays to find out whether they are harmless?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the original point made by Deputy Deasy.  I do not know if he has available to him a copy of my Second Stage speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I should like to quote a few paragraphs from my speech in order to bring the issue we are debating here into focus.  I stated:</P>
      <P>There is a specific provision in the Act of 1958 in regard to the spraying of potatoes.  This deals with the situation where a destructive pest, Colorado beetle, for example, is found in a potato crop.  There is provision to make sure the crop...is sprayed in order to get rid of...the pest.</P>
      <P>There is also provision for the payment of compensation in the case of crops which have been destroyed, I continued:</P>
      <P>These controls have served us well. This country is fortunate in having a very good standard of plant health. Thankfully we have remained free from a number of destructive insects and pests which are to be found on mainland Europe and elsewhere abroad.  This fortunate position is attributable primarily to our island situation which forms a barrier against the natural migratory movements of destructive insects and pests.</P>
      <P>Later on I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like at this point to explain to the House that since our entry into the European Community in 1973 there has been a change in the legislative provision under which we operate as regards importation of plant material from members states of the Community.  The Community system <Col N="1915" /> no longer allowed us to insist on licensing control on imports from other member states.  However, under the EC system we continue to insist on health certificates issued by the authorites of the exporting member state. We also have the right to check a proportion of imports at the time of import.  In addition, there are a number of Community provisions which safeguard individual member states from particular destructive insects and pests of which they are free.</P>
    <P>This is a very important point.  I continued:</P>
    <P>At the present time the Community is considering the plant health controls which will operate in the Internal Market after 1992.  A good deal of negotiations has yet to be gone through before the post-1992 control system will take final shape.  Our objective in these negotiations is, of course, that while having full regard to the implications of 1992 and afterwards we will be striving to ensure that any changes in procedures will not leave us open to unacceptable risks.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Deasy and other Members of the House will appreciate that in the context of the completion of the Internal Market the protection of our health status is very much under consideration. The arrangements which will be put in place post-1992 will depend very much on the outcome of the negotiations which take place during the intervening time.  As the Deputy pointed out, the control of pesticides will depend very much on what happens subsequent those negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister what has happened since 1958 which necessitates the Bill being updated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in reply to an earlier question, we brought forward this section on the advice of the Attorney General.  It is a matter of updating this section as we find it to cater for any <Col N="1916" /> circumstances that may arise.  There will be freer movement of plants Communitywide post-1992 and the necessity to have legislation which will cater for this is of paramount importance.  This is what we are endeavouring to do here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I advise the House that the Chair has the duty, albeit unpopular at times, to advise the House of what is the norm on Committee Stage?  We are discussing Committee Stage and section 3, as I would see it, refers to a person or persons who contravene what is in the Act.  Ordinarily we would be obliged to stay with what is in the section.  In so far as a certain latitude has obtained to date, I do not want to curtail it too much now, but I would ask the co-operation of the House that we would confine ourselves, as we must on Committee Stage, to what is in the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to contravention of a spraying notice under section 3.  I want to refer to a statement made by Deputy Garland about organic farming.  Is spraying in contravention of organic farming?  Will spraying with bluestone or dithane be likely to prohibit potatoes being marketed as organic vegetables? Can the Minister give me an answer to that question?  Is the alternative of not spraying and letting the potatoes become blighted more desirable to spraying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, the certification of organic produce is catered for by the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association who have a symbol arrangement.  The question of the certification of produce which is truly organic is very much under consideration at Community level at present.  While it is reasonable to anticipate that proposals will be brought forward during 1991, we are not in a position at this point to give definitive answers to some of the queries raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> As the Deputy will appreciate, the issue of certifying what is or is not organic has been under debate for some time and will probably continue to be the subject of debate for some time to come.  Hopefully we will have a much clearer picture on this issue before the end of the year. This subject has been debated at great length at Community level and naturally as a good member of the Community we will have regard to the Commission's thinking on this issue.  I sincerely hope that we will have clearer answers to the questions posed by the Deputy before the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Having managed to find a copy of the 1958 Act I am a little clearer about what section 3 proposes to amend. To add to the last point made, this is certainly a most important section given that it has been reputed by an environment protection agency in America that there are sprays used in this country to control potato blight which are clearly carcinogenic.  I mention specifically the three related compounds, meneb, mancozeb and zineb.  Having thrown away my urban working class hat and put on my soft cap, with my pipe in my mouth, and speaking on behalf of the agricultural sector, it is important that these sprays that are in use&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people could die from eating wrongly-treated potatoes, particularly if the potatoes are used for animal feed.  One would be worried about passing down the food chain infected foodstuffs.  I would ask the Minister &mdash; I am sure there is no-one better than the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to tell me if I am not in order &mdash; to give a little background on what constitutes spraying notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputies are straying into the next field, or even the one beyond that.  What is envisaged here <Col N="1918" /> is quite specific.  I would be willing to come back into the Chamber next week or the week after to tease out the exact problems outlined by Deputy Byrne. Bearing in mind that we are on Committee Stage, the legislation is quite specific.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as potato blight is concerned, the alternative to spraying is quite simple; there would be no crop at all, as million of Irish people discovered in the 1840s because without spraying to prevent blight, the crop would be diseased and could not be eaten.  However, there is some light at the end of the tunnel because I understand our plant breeders have come up with a new variety of potato which will be resistant to blight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in Deputy Byrne's comments.  He was either before or after this time in mentioning the sprays for potatoes because he did not mention reglone, the normal spray for killing stalks.  In regard to Deputy Deasy's remarks as to whether the spray would affect organic grown potatoes, the spray is only for the foliage and it is only when the blight appears that problems arise with potatoes.  Therefore I do not think there would be any problem with organic grown potatoes.  There should be a serious examination of the sprays.  Reglone and other sprays are mild forms of gramoxane which is lethal.  That is a matter that should be examined very closely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister twice <Col N="1919" /> about the research facilities available, but I received no reply.  We are talking about a very serious matter of spraying orders. Some Members, including myself, are not entirely happy because we have not attempted to go through the system by which these sprays can be deducted to be safe or harmful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deasy will accept that the section deals with the offence that is committed if a person does not comply with the spraying notice.  I do not think we are entitled to debate on this section the merits or demerits of spraying as a horticultural process.  In debating this section, what is at issue is whether a person who contravenes or fails to comply with a spraying notice is guilty of an offence, and how he shall be dealt with.  We must confine ourselves to that.  Later, there will be a motion before the House &ldquo;that the Bill do now pass&rdquo;, and matters of the kind being discussed now might be in order then.  The Chair is convinced that Members are not in order in respect of section 3 which we are discussing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is conceivable that a person who is spraying could be guilty of an offence against all the laws of nature if we do not know what testing facilities or resources there are in the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise one final point which I forgot to make.  Many organic farmers have a moral objection to the use of chemical sprays because they feel that the disadvantages of using sprays counterbalance the advantages, but they have no option but to use these sprays.  Under section 4 failure to comply with an order can result in imprisonment. This has to be seriously considered.  It would be a very sad day if an organic farmer, on a matter of principle, refused <Col N="1920" /> to spray his crop with what he thought were very damaging chemicals and as a result received a jail sentence.  We have to face this dilemma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>If a crop was attacked by the Colorado beetle, despite the fact that the farmer might have a moral objection to spraying, it would be highly irresponsible of him not to do so.  If that insect spread throughout the country it would mean an end to our potato crop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to introduce a new section at this stage but I was surprised to receive a letter from the Ceann Comhairle saying he would not accept it. The purpose of my amendment was to introduce a new section banning the use and sale of strychnine as a method of controlling the spreading of vermin or predators.  This has been accepted in most countries.  I had hoped the Minister would at least have given us the benefit of his wisdom why he is not allowing this amendment, because obviously it is the Minister who advises the Ceann Comhairle on such matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The gentle way in which the Deputy has sought to refer to his amendment which has been ruled out of order requires me to say that if we look at Second Stage of this Bill we will see that it refers to precautions that would be taken in respect of diseases and pests which affect plants and crops.  It does not extend into the area mentioned by the Deputy. However desirable or however the Deputy might think there is a need for legislation there, sin ceist eile.  We are confined to what is in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I agree that may have been the idea on Second Stage, but I think you, as a long serving Member of this House, know that many Ministers use a Bill like this to introduce legislation that is urgently needed.  This is the time of year when strychnine is used.  The Minister will lose the opportunity to do anything about this although it is now lambing season.  Last year strychnine was scattered over fields and it is a matter which has not been attended to.  There is an opportunity to rectify it in the Bill and I thought the Minister would take advantage of it.  Having warned the Minister in this regard, I thought that he &mdash; or another Minister &mdash; would bring in a Bill to deal with this substance in the short term.  That would have satisfied me.</P>

      <P>Over the past ten years there were two prosecutions, one in 1988 and the other in 1989.  Both prosecutions were of the same person for similar offences against an order made under the Act. This indicates that the low level of fine is not a deterrent and it is felt that this will be more the case post-1992 when the new EC regime will give rise to greater movement of plant material between member states.</P>

      <P>Deputy Farrelly raised this matter on Second Stage.  The prosecutions arose under the Fire-Blight Order, one of the orders made under the Destructive Insects and Pests (Consolidation) Act, 1958.  A nursery man, on whose nursery a plant infected with fire-blight disease was found, was served with a notice not to sell plants infected with fire-blight until continued seasonal sampling showed the nursery to be free of the disease.  He was found to be selling prohibited material and was prosecuted in April 1988.  He was fined £5 each in respect of the two summonses.  He was again found selling them and was prosecuted in May 1989 and fined £10 on each of three summonses.  The case was finally <Col N="1923" /> resolved when his nursery was declared clear of fire-blight in 1989 and the restrictions were lifted.</P>

I would have thought there would have been many more convictions because nobody would mind paying £5 but they would certainly mind paying a fine of £1,000.  I hope the Minister is not saying that breaches of the old law were not pursued because it was not worth bothering about.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an important one, amending and updating the Destructive Insects and Pests (Consolidation) Act, 1958.  That Act is one of the basic means of, on the one hand, safeguarding against the introduction of destructive insects and pests and, on the other, of dealing with any outbreak of disease or pests which might arise here.  The 1958 Act has worked well over the years and received <Col N="1925" /> a high level of support and co-operation from the trade and farming community. As I explained on Second Stage, some notable outbreaks of disease and pests have been dealt with in recent years and very few prosecutions have been necessary. The amending Bill is not intended to be more oppressive or restrictive on growers developing their farm enterprises but it is a modernising and updating of certain provisions of the Act which will help to maintain our favourable plant health status in the freer trading conditions in the EC Single Market in the coming years.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy R. Bruton on 26 February 1991:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the Minister for Health for his failure to undertake structural reform or to engage in coherent planning of the health services; and, in particular, for his failure to make adequate financial provision in 1991 to maintain existing services, the result of which will be deteriorating conditions falling most heavily on the handicapped, the elderly and those on public waiting lists for hospitals; and call on the Government (1) to allow health boards run limited overdrafts pending a reassessment of resources needed by them to maintain and develop services in 1991 and (2) to introduce a proper reform plan for the health servics based on numerous studies now available on the need for structural reform.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening I referred to the cutbacks in the allocation the Minister has granted to health boards and the implications of those cutbacks.  The Minister for Health has charged all health boards with providing the same level of service they provided in 1989 and the current budget provisions will not allow them to maintain that level of service. Indeed, they will result in health boards being forced to cut services back severely, thus causing suffering and further waiting lists for our people.  Our health services are in a vulnerable, weak condition and health boards have been forced to decide what services they will cut back, what beds will be closed and what staff will be let go, temporary or otherwise, to live within the allocations made by the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous for the Minister to attempt to tell us bed numbers will be maintained at the same level as last year or 1989.  How can that be?  Who is to provide the nursing, the medical care and the round the clock service that is necessary? I am sure the Minister is aware that health boards last week, and the week before, made decisions which will reduce beds in acute hospitals and will force the closure of those beds during holiday periods.  This will reduce the necessity for boards to replace staff on holidays.  These <Col N="1927" /> acute hospitals are surviving with skeleton staffs.  How many skeletons will we as Members of the Oireachtas be responsible for at the end of a period, as it will be almost impossible to quantify the needs during holiday periods particularly in acute hospitals on our national primary routes which have to be available around the clock to deal with tragic accident cases?</P>
    <P>Our health services are existing from day to day and not providing the essential service required.  The Labour Party are, therefore, calling on the Government to introduce a Supplementary Estimate. The Government have had no problem about introducing Supplementary Estimates. We had a whole string of them before Christmas for the Taoiseach's Office, the purchase of Carysfort and for the health services.  The Government are not slow in introducing Supplementary Estimates for political reasons or whatever else.  We are suggesting they do the same now and allocate £15 million to provide services for the people we represent. To do so would be a great deal more honest than what has been going on all around the country recently.</P>
    <P>Last week Fianna Fáail Deputies, Senators, councillors and the Leader of the other House went to the health boards and told them, in the words of the former Tánaiste, that there was no problem, money was on the way.  At the same time the Department of Health are letting it be known, without contradiction, that there might be savings of up to £8 million arising from the establishment of the national drugs formulary and those savings might be applied to easing the crisis facing health boards.  In other words, health boards are being told, &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;. Angry citizens and people in need of health services are being fobbed off with the story that more money is on the way. Every Member knows that there is no way savings which might arise at the end of the year can deal with the crisis.  A Supplementary Estimate must be introduced immediately.  The Department of Health confirmed again this week that <Col N="1928" /> they have no intention of introducing a Supplementary Estimate.  In short, the public are being told lies and there will be no improvement in the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>What is not true?  We know there will no additional money unless a Supplementary Estimate is introduced. Last night when the Minister spoke on the provision for drugs even the words he used were peculiar.  He said, &ldquo;if the existing allocations do not meet the requirements&rdquo;.  We would like to know about this because there are hidden costs over which health boards have no control. Health boards are unable to control the cost of drug refunds, the GMS or the price being charged by the Department for hospital stays outside their region. However, the Minister expects them to be responsible.</P>
      <P>The only comfort in all this is that it will probably lead to another drubbing of the Fianna Fáil Party in the local elections. I would much prefer if the health services were not made an election issue, but the Minister in his period on those benches ensured that health services and cutbacks were used as political sticks to beat people with.  I hope the Taoiseach will not claim in the course of the June elections that nobody told him about this crisis.  The Taoiseach is being told here and now that there is a crisis because of health policy.</P>
      <P>We view our amendment as a temporary stop gap and not as a lasting solution to this increasing problem.  Since Deputy O'Hanlon became Minister for Health the health services have gone into a state of crisis particularly as a result of policy decisions by the Government to reduce the financial allocations to health year after year.  When the Minister's predecessor left the Department of Health spending in that area was at 7 per cent of GNP, but it reduced to 6.60 per cent in 1987, to 6.30 per cent in 1988 and to 5.80 per cent at the end of 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis in the health service is reflected in statistics submitted by the <Col N="1929" /> Department in response to questions in this House.  Some 4,000 health board workers and health workers generally have gone out of employment since the Minister took office.  In the last year the Minister brought some back because they could not be done without but there is a net deficit of 4,000 health workers since the Minister took office.  The Minister introduced charges for essential services which had already been included in the PRSI contributions which were increased before Christmas.  Two thousand acute beds, 300 geriatric beds and 700 psychiatric beds have gone out of the system. Some health boards are now forced to cut back by millions of pounds in psychiatric services&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no patients for the psychiatric beds.  They do not need them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when we were just about to make some progress.  The Minister says he does not have any patients for the beds but that is because they are all out in the community and there is no money to look after them.  Up to 24 hospitals have been closed and there are further threats to closed some hospitals even for short periods.  These hospitals should be in the system all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics alone are only a cold impression of the suffering caused by health cuts.  Suffering has also been increased for people who suffer from spina bifida, hydrocephalitis, mental handicap, psychiatric illness, asthma, AIDS and a host of other ailments.  To their suffering must be added the hardship and indignity caused to the elderly and the infirm.  These groups are to a considerable extent defenceless and voiceless.  It took the 1989 general election to bring home to this Government the reality of the suffering and to remind them of who caused the suffering.  It might be as well to consider that in the context of the local elections this year. The politicians who caused this suffering are those who proposed the health estimates over the last four years and those who did not oppose the cutbacks.  For <Col N="1930" /> four years the Labour Party have sought to bring home the depth of the crisis.  It was not until the Dáil was dissolved and candidates began to knock on doors that they began to realise there was something wrong with the health services.</P>
    <P>However, it is not necessary to listen to the Labour Party on this subject.  One need go on further than the document &ldquo;Let's Look Again&rdquo; by the Joint Health Commission of the Catholic Church which unequivocally described health care as a human right so basic that there is an explicit obligation on the community to discriminate positively in favour of the poor.  Instead, policy has discriminated against the poor, making it increasingly difficult for people on low incomes to secure any access, let alone equality of access to the health services.  The extra £15 million that we are demanding for the health services will not reverse that trend.  At best it will help to stave off some of the worst consequences of the cutbacks for a short period.  We will never have equality of access to the health services unless we devote a proper level of resources to the health services.  The Government had access to a whole range of reports on health funding.  They had the Kennedy report and the Fox report and still nothing has been done except to fiddle at the edges of the system.  A final decision cannot be made on how much we spend on our health services until we decide whether health care is a basic human right.  If it is we must make the necessary provision to give effect to that principle.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for me to deal with every aspect of the health services that needs attention.  However, the area of mental handicap is creating increased anxiety as this area is in acute crisis.  The most worrying feature is that there is little or no planning for the future.  Lip service has been paid by the Minister and the Government to the concept of planning but the agencies are too busy dealing with the crisis in current services and worrying about next year's financial allocation to look ahead and plan.  The human hardship involved in mental handicap will get <Col N="1931" /> a good deal worse unless we start planning in the knowledge that resources will become available.  It is imperative that the Government commit themselves for a period of years to improving the funding available for mental handicap.  I am not talking about pocket money.  The extra revenue made available in this area in the past two years has been in the region of £2 million and it will be £3 million extra this year.  This represents about 2p in every 10p in that area.  This is a scandal by any standards.  In our amendment we are calling for another £4 million this year to come to grips with this problem.  As I said this morning, I sympathise with mothers of children with a mental handicap who were forced to occupy the Minister's offices today to bring the Minister's attention to their problem.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have constantly demonstrated to the Minister for Health the heavy burden placed on families with mentally handicapped members because of the lack of resources and residential facilities.  A nation that prides itself on Christian values is just paying lip service to the aspiration to cherish our children equally.  It is disgraceful that there is not a Government commitment to providing resources which would express the Government's concern.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about all the voluntary groups in this area &mdash; the mental handicap associations, the Hospice Movement, the physically disabled movement, the Wheelchair Association, the AIDS groups and the Conquer Cancer Society who are very active in these areas, who are forced to organise charity functions in order to arrange operations for children who cannot afford to wait two or three years for an operation, for people who are in danger of not getting the operation unless they can afford to pay for it.  In constituencies throughout the country Labour Deputies are involved in collecting money to assist people to get operations to which they should be entitled under the health service.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now going to open up all beds in public hospitals to public <Col N="1932" /> patients only, which means that health boards will be forced to redesignate public beds as private ones&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to ensure that they have a continuing income from VHI. That is the only way that public hospitals will be able to come to grips with the loss that will be incurred through private patients using public beds.  We will wait until July but we have warned the Minister that there is a possibility that it will create problems.  If the Minister increases the number of private beds in public hospitals, then he will reduce the number of public beds and he will create additional waiting lists.  That is one of the inevitabilities.</P>
      <P>To remove this subject matter from the public political arena on the Floor of this House, it might be opportune to take account of the Labour Party's suggestion to establish an all-party Dáil committee which could have discussion and dialogue with the officials of the Department of Health who make decisions about the distribution of funds to health boards. People operating in the health area do not know what norm is used to decide how much any particular health board get to carry out their functions.  The Minister admitted at his recent meeting with the chairman of the South-Eastern Health Board that their application and their accounts were correct.  Their deficit is correct at £1.8 million, based on last year's level of service.  How can the health boards get their share of the proportion of money available for any particular category of bed?  I would like an opportunity to discuss this with whatever section deals with it, away from the glare of the publicity.  Let us have responsibility about this.  One of the Fine Gael speakers agreed to this process last night.  I would hope that the Government in responding would agree to this concept of an all-party Committee of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am offering the Minister a promise that if he brings in a Supplementary Estimate, the Labour Party will guarantee him a very substantial majority in this <Col N="1933" /> House.  We would be respected for doing so, the Minister would be respected for doing so, and he would be supported on many sides of this House.  The Minister must not hide any longer behind platitudes and clichés written by civil servants in his office.  The Minister has the competence and the professional training to make decisions based on medical ethics alone, apart from the restriction that may be on him.  We are asking the Minister to recognise the real problem. Whether there are elections or not, the problem is there.  The Minister will be doing the country, his party and the Government a real service if he does that and he will have our support.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Ferris one would be forgiven if one thought one was back in the middle eighties when major health board overruns were the order of the day and when Government borrowing was well over £2,000 million per annum.  We are not back in those times and this Government are not going to return to those times on either of those two issues.  We must get those issues out of the way; they are not a solution.  The Minister could come in here any day if he had a free hand to borrow willy nilly and throw millions of pounds at the health boards, but that is not a solution. It is not an option for us.  Deputy Ferris will have to face up to that fact.  In fairness to the Deputy, he has disagreed with the Fine Gael proposal on overruns, so clearly he has learned his lesson from the last days of the Barry Desmond administration. We should be thankful for that, but he has gone on to look at the prospects of what I consider to be basically selling family silver.  That is not an answer either for current expenditure.  You do not sell capital assets to fund current <Col N="1934" /> expenditure.  It would be very unwise because that runs out.</P>
      <P>We have to face the problem that is present in the health service, not only in this country but throughout the world. That is the responsibility of this Government and that is the responsibility and the challenge which has been taken up by the Minister for Health since he took over in 1987.  The Fine Gael motion accuses the Minister of many failures.  It asserts that he has failed to undertake structural reform and that he does not have a coherent plan for health services. It further asserts that he has failed to make adequate financial provision to maintain services in 1991, with the result that conditions will deteriorate for a number of categories of patients.  It then calls on him to solve the problem by increasing overdrafts and by introducing a reform plan for the health services.</P>
      <P>In his address to the House yesterday evening, the Minister dealt definitively with the unfounded assertions and the soft options contained in the Fine Gael motion.  I want to remind the House of the principal points made by the Minister and deal with a number of issues which have been raised during the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>It has been a dreary experience listening to the same tired assertions and accusations being made by the Opposition. Not one of their speakers has touched on any of the really fundamental issues in the health services, issues which should be the concern of every Member of this House, irrespective of the party to which he or she belongs.  Not one single constructive suggestion has been made which would assist the Minister or the Government in coping with one of the most difficult issues which faces Governments all over the world at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will start then by reminding the House of the undertakings which the Minister gave yesterday evening in dealing with the claim that services will deteriorate during 1991.  Since last year, the number of acute hospital beds has been set at 12,000.  This level of bed availability will be maintained during 1991, apart from <Col N="1935" /> seasonal closures which are a normal part of the health service.</P>
    <P>This is a point which was not picked up by any of the contributors from the Opposition last night.  The Minister and the Government have given a specific commitment that the 12,000 acute beds which were available last year will be available this year.  That means no closures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will help health boards and agencies to maintain this level of provision by supporting an enhanced value for money programme, and by assisting in meeting any costs which occur on demand-led schemes beyond that provided in the initial Estimates.</P>
      <P>The Government are rightly insisting that there will be prudent management of the significant resources which have been made available to health agencies. It is not going to accept that there is a need for any additional funding until it is clear that everything possible is being done to make the best use of the resources available to agencies, individually and collectively.  It is certainly not going to come to a conclusion about this at this time of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will honour fully all the commitments which they have given, including those given by the Minister in the House yesterday evening, in relation <Col N="1936" /> to the maintenance of services.  We will maintain the services at a level not less than that which was approved for 1990.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to waiting lists is clear, straightforward and simple.  As he stated at the conclusion of his address yesterday evening, his strategy is to work at getting the maximum return from every pound invested and seek efficiencies where they can be found.  Then and only then should the question of additional funding be considered to finance needs and not demands.</P>
    <P>There has been reference during the debate to waiting lists and claims made about their seriousness, whether for inpatient or outpatient services.  A very selective presentation of the recommendations made by the Kennedy Group was made by today's <i>Irish Independent.</i> The headline boldly proclaims &ldquo;Waiting Lists Due to Lack of Beds&rdquo;.  That is not, in fact, what the report states.  I would like to take this opportunity to put the record straight in this House.</P>
    <P>The report makes a number of very important recommendations regarding in-patient waiting lists and outpatients services.  It does not accept that it is merely a question of throwing more resources in an undirected manner at either or both of these problems.  In fact, it makes detailed recommendations on a lengthy number of steps which should be taken by each hospital before it is in a position to demonstrate that it cannot provide an adequate service with the resource already available to it.</P>
    <P>In relation to waiting lists, the report recommends that waiting lists are validated. Each hospital should maintain comprehensive, standardised information concerning the numbers and types of patients awaiting admission.  Validation to establish reliable waiting list data should be adopted as a firm policy in each hospital and such policies should ensure that appropriate management and clinical action is taken on foot of such reviews.</P>
    <P>Hospitals should immediately carry out a bulk postal review of patients who have been on a waiting list for more than an agreed period of time.  On completion <Col N="1937" /> of this comprehensive review and validation of current waiting lists, formalised regular arrangements should be made by each hospital for the ongoing review and validation of lists.</P>
    <P>Might I say that this approach is not standard practice in all hospitals and until it is, data relating to waiting lists should be treated with great caution.</P>
    <P>The report further recommends better scheduling of activity to reduce waiting times, analyses by hospitals to establish whether their activity levels, having regard to case mix, are broadly comparable with the productivity levels of similar services in other locations, a systematic review of the scope for increasing levels of day surgery for appropriate conditions, development of appropriate information technology and better information to general practitioners with regard to the average waiting times for admission.</P>
    <P>In addition to these obvious and sensible steps, the report further points out that activity levels and throughput can be improved by changing the manner in which patients are treated.  The report comments:</P>
    <P>It is only when the scope for redeploying beds, theatre time and other resources within a hospital have been shown to be impossible, having regard to target waiting times, and when the scope for increasing day case activity has been maximised, that a valid case for resources can be made on the basis of waiting problems.  In short, we do not consider that waiting times, even when validated, or themselves constitute a basis for requests for additional resources by the hospitals.</P>
    <P>The report makes a number of similar recommendations with regard to the organisation of the out-patient services. It highlights the need for better adjournment systems for out-patient clinics, for a policy for dealing with non-attenders, and for reducing the level of unnecessary return attendances.  It makes recommendations on better patient information and it highlights the need to match staff <Col N="1938" /> to the particular demands of providing a high quality out-patient service.</P>
    <P>Again, the report refers to the need for the computerisation of pathology and radiology departments and the introduction of good transmission and retrievals systems between the various departments which are involved in the treatment of out-patients.  It emphasises the need for a review of out-patient waiting lists and highlights the scope which exists for the development of out-patient care.</P>
    <P>These recommendations do not come from a group representative of any single discipline.  The group which assisted Mr. David Kennedy was representative of the management of the hospitals, their consultant staffs, the general practitioners.</P>
    <P>The message from the report is very clear and very much in line with the approach which the Minister indicated to the House in grappling with demands for additional resources.  There is plenty of scope for putting our house in better order and we have an obligation to do this before we assume that there is an unanswerable case for devoting additional resources which may, in any event, end up being spent in ways which are neither efficient nor effective.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton fulminated last night about the supposed horrors of the accident and emergency services in the Dublin area.  Let me put the record straight.  Since 4 September 1989, all major hospitals have been open 24 hours per day, seven days a week.  Prior to September 1989, a rota system operated whereby two hospitals were on call.</P>
    <P>The 24 hour accident and emergency service costs an additional £6 million per annum.  Approximately 162 additional staff have been assigned to the six hospitals to facilitate the expanded service. Ten additional observation beds have been provided at St. Vincent's, 14 at St. James's and 16 beds are coming on stream in the Mater Hospital.  In addition, a new accident and emergency department has been opened in St. James's Hospital, while St. Vincent's Hospital have extended their accident <Col N="1939" /> and emergency department by 15,000 sq. ft.</P>
    <P>Over the past few weeks, there has been additional pressure on accident and emergency departments which may be attributable to the recent severe weather conditions.  This is in line with the normal pattern of demand at this time of the year.  By the very nature of its work, it is not possible to say in advance what the workload of an accident and emergency department will be on any particular day. From time to time, particular pressures will arise which tend to level off and decline over a period.  This is the experience of all accident and emergency departments in all major urban centres.</P>
    <P>The fact is that all appropriate medical attention is provided to patients in the accident and emergency departments. Although delays have been experienced recently in arranging admissions to the wards, all patients requiring hospitalisation were admitted.</P>
    <P>The overall accident and emergency service is being monitored closely by the Steering Committee on Accident and Emergency Services under the chairmanship of the Eastern Health Board, which is keeping my Department informed of the position on a daily basis. Protection arrangements have been put in place whereby each hospital makes contact with ambulance control and advises of the bed situation, at 9-10 a.m. and 4-5 p.m. each day in order to ensure that delays are kept to a minimum.  The six accident and emergency hospitals are currently implementing the recommendations contained in the Kennedy report in order to shorten waiting times in accident and emergency departments and to improve management.  I would like to point out that this is an example of the benefits to be achieved from reports and confirms that certain aspects of various reports are being implemented.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus that we should continue to spend the extra money that becomes available in the community rather than in our hospital services.  If we continue to spend all the extra money on <Col N="1940" /> the hospital services, we will choke the system because the logic of spending the money in hospitals and not developing our community services is that more and more people will find themselves in hospital beds when they might be more appropriately treated elsewhere.</P>
    <P>At present there are elderly people in our acute hospitals who have completed their acute medical treatment and are waiting to be placed in a home for the elderly or in their own community with support services.  There are also physically disabled people who are permanently in acute beds in hospitals.  We want to spend the extra money coming on stream in the community so that we will build up our community services and provide places in the community for those who need them.  The ideal is to be treated in the area most appropriate to ones need.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from health economics, that is what we want in humane terms.  People do not want to go into hospital unless it is absolutely necessary. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> spells out very clearly the direction in which we should be going.  I believe there is a consensus to go in that direction, despite the fact that Opposition Deputies are saying that we should put more and more money into the acute hospital service.</P>
    <P>In allocating capital and current funding to each service, we will be implementing the key recommendations of the working groups which examined that area in detail.  Deputy Bruton made a big point out of the lack of service targets for community services in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  He blithely ignored the fact that there are already in existence detailed policy statements and targets for most of the services covered by the commitments in the programme. For example, the priorities identifed by the working party on health and welfare services for the elderly, <i>The Years Ahead,</i> are closely reflected in the provisions of the programme.  We will be allocating resources to develop home nursing and other support services.  We will also extend respite facilities to relieve <Col N="1941" /> families caring for dependent elderly in their own home, and we have committed ourselves to ensuring an adequate number of extended care beds in those health boards experiencing significant increases in their elderly population.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to implmenting the key recommendations of <i>The Years Ahead</i> is illustrated by the speed with which we enacted the Health (Nuring Homes) Act, 1990.  The funding commitments under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will ensure that both the report and the new Act are fully implemented as rapidly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Paper on services for the disabled proved very valuable in identifying service priorities.  The report of the review group on mental handicap services has been accepted by the Government and will influence significantly the determination of priorities, as well as giving a big boost to service co-ordination.  Priorities for people with physical disabilities will include the provision of additional paramedical services, day centres and home support services. We will also arrange for the provision of respite care facilities and new training workshops, as well as improving existing facilities.</P>
      <P>In the area of mental handicap, the programme undertakes to allocate resources to community and residential services.  As recommended by the review group on mental handicap services, our emphasis will be on identifying an appropriate mix between communitybased and residential facilities, so that all mentally handicapped persons will enjoy care in the most appropriate setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would emphasise that developments will take place in a structured, co-ordinated way, based on the priorities already identified by the working group.  The Department will continue to work closely with health boards and voluntary agencies providing services for the handicapped to ensure that the entitlements of the mentally handicapped under existing <Col N="1942" /> legislation and service arrangements are made available in a consistent, caring and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>Central to the development of our psychiatric services has been the study group report, <i>Planning For The Future</i>.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides continued impetus for implementing the priorities it identified. We will make funds available for the continued development of specialist assessment and rehabilitation units associated with acute general hospitals. In addition, we have undertaken to fund the provision of additional places in day centres, workshops and support hostels, together with developing further our child and adolescent psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been determined for some time to update and strengthen the law in relation to the care of children, particularly those who are at risk or who have been mistreated or abused in any way.  This House approved the Child Care Bill before Christmas and I hope that the Seanad will do so in the near future.</P>
    <P>The programme commits funding for implementation of the Bill on a phased basis.  We will be providing resources for extra residential facilities and home support services.  We will also increase the number of social workers, psychologists and medical staff over the period of the programme.</P>
    <P>We made considerable progress last year in developing orthodontic and adult dental services from the extra funding in the 1990 budget.  This process will be continued through the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  We will be allocating resources for the recruitment of additional staff and the development of existing personnel, as well as for re-equipping existing health board dental facilities and the commissioning of new facilities.  We will also be engaging in a major programme to develop health centres over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the Government will be developing community based services in a co-ordinated and planned way.  Our policy will be based on priorities identified by the expert working <Col N="1943" /> groups in each area, and will be implemented through a careful allocation of additional capital and current funding over the period of the programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the differences in the financial 1991 allocations for the health boards and voluntary hospitals. It will be recalled that the Government committed last year an additional £25 million to the general hospital system.  This was provided to maintain the level of services in the acute hospital system.  The voluntary hospital sector has a substantial proportion of acute beds yet has a total funding base which is about one-third that of the health boards.  Any significant increase in the funding of the hospital sector generally will, therefore, have a greater impact in percentage terms on the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen castigated the health boards and their members, and accused the Minister of indecision because he has not accepted the recommendation of the Commission on Funding to abolish the boards and set up one body to manage the health services.  The Government have set out their position very clearly in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.</P>
    <P>There will be a practical rather than an ideological approach to organisational structures; any changes in structures will take account of the needs of patients and of the strengths and traditions of individual organisations within an overall framework for delivery of services.  It must also reflect the interests of the patient, the people who deliver the services and the taxpayer.  Based on these principles, the Government will announce proposals for the improvement of the administration and management of the services during 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for giving me this time.  In the time at my disposal I will concentrate on making two key points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my budget speech two weeks ago I warned the Government that health could very well be the Achille's heel of this Government and might very well be <Col N="1944" /> made the Achille's heel of this Government. That is something we cannot afford to ignore.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that patients, their families, taxpayers and consumers find it extraordinarily difficult to understand how it is that there can still be problems in the health services at a time when so much increased Government resources are being ploughed into the service.  Last night the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, quite rightly pointed out to this House that more than £1.5 billion was being made available for the health services this year, that is 22 per cent of non-capital Government spending.  This is the highest amount ever spent on the health services since the foundation of the State.  Despite all that, we still have problems within the services.</P>
    <P>The view of the Progressive Democrats is that part of the problem lies with a health service that in its administration and management is overtly complex, and that rests very much in the hands of the health boards that are bogged down with excessive bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government negotiated in July 1989 one of the commitments was that the new Government would review &ldquo;the entire system of management of the health services nationally, including the health boards, to ensure an adequate efficient health service providing the best possible patient care&rdquo;. I was relieved, therefore, to hear the Minister Deputy O'Hanlon outline last night the detailed value for money measures which are now being instituted in health boards and are being supervised by his Department.  I also look forward to a major restructuring of hospital services particularly in the Dublin area following the specialist Fox and Kennedy reports.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the emphasis which the Minister placed on value for money reviews on matters like energy costs, the cost of hospital supplies and pay generally. The publication too of the National Drugs Formulary last week by the Minister should also lead to a major reduction in the cost of drugs and to greater prescribing of generic drugs.</P>
    <P>What is needed right across the board <Col N="1945" /> at this time in the health service is a greater degree of transparency, more basic information and management systems which are independent of sectoral medical interests.  Very basic every day issues need to be tackled.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State mention some of these issues.  My belief is that proper regulation of hospital outpatients' appointments ought to be put in place so that patients do not have to hang around for hour after hour waiting for treatment as happens so frequently at present.</P>
    <P>Another matter is that hospital waiting lists for various medical procedures should be overhauled.  We should have detailed and regularly published waiting lists including the numbers of persons on that waiting list and the categories under which these people are waiting for treatment. These should be regularly updated so that patients and their families would know exactly &mdash; or relatively exactly &mdash; where they stand on the list and how soon they can hope to have the treatment which they so urgently need.  Those two matters, if addressed urgently, would make a vast improvement in the degree of patient care as it hits patients or impending patients at the cutting edge.</P>
    <P>I am very taken aback with the prescription that is written for ailments in the health service by the Fine Gael Party. There are problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>At least we have a prescription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very costly prescription and that is the point I am trying to make.  What this country now needs are not politicians who highlight our problems but politicians who will find solutions to our problems.  The solution to the problems in the health service does not lie in allowing the health boards to go into an overdraft situation for the remainder of the year.  For that reason I could not give my support to the motion before the House but I look forward to a substantial improvement in the health services in the year immediately ahead.  I take heart and courage from what the Minister said in his speech last night.  I <Col N="1946" /> am also encouraged by what is said in relation to health in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> where a commitment is given to a radical overhaul and development of our health service in the year ahead.  If that happens we will see a badly needed and long awaited improvement in the year which we are about to enter.</P>

      <P>Just over a year ago, on 6 and 7 February 1990, the Dáil discussed a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health because of the serious crisis then facing the health services. Twelve months later, it is clear that the problems of the health service are as serious as ever and in many respects have worsened.  The Workers' Party have little confidence in the Minister as was the case last year.  If the Minister for Health and his Minister of State were to stand before the bar of justice they would stand indicted and condemned because both have come into this House and tried to defend the indefensible.  They have stated that it is scaremongering by politicians. In the little time available to me I hope to refute that argument by the Minister. I will give an example of the Southern Health Board where the chief executive officer and his executive were asked last autumn to submit their requirements for 1991.  This was done using the adjusted 1990 allocation as the base for determining the 1991 requirement.  If the chief <Col N="1947" /> executive officer and his team are employed by the Southern Health Board and the Department they must be regarded as competent to do a job.  The figure they arrived at was £151,432,000. That was the increased allocation they required under general hospital services, community care and psychiatric services programmes.  Who was better qualified to know the requirements?  The result is that an allocation was made leaving a shortfall in excess of £4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>They got £149 million, subtract that from £151 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a shortfall in the health boards in excess of £104 million. In the Western Health Board there is a shortfall of £3.25 million, the South Eastern Health Board have a shortfall of £1.80 million and the Southern Health Board have a shortfall of £4 million while there is a shortfall too, in the Northern Health Board.  The Minister's argument is completely refuted.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about the availability of 12,000 beds.  Can he tell us what ratio is now being applied?  The ratio used to be three beds per 1,000 of the population, if that were the case he would require in excess of 12,000 beds.  The health board cannot maintain the same level of service &mdash; I am sorry Deputy Quill has left &mdash; because there are such things as wage increases, a 39 hour week and inflation but have all those been taken into consideration?  In case the Minister thinks I was talking off the top of my head I will quote, as I am entitled, from the minutes of the meeting of the Southern Health Board on 7 January 1991 as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board considered letter dated 18th December, 1990, from the Department of Health regarding the Board's allocation for non-capital health expenditure 1991 and report thereon dated 20th December, 1990. The Chief Executive Officer provided a further detailed verbal report <Col N="1948" /> explaining the background to the estimated requirements of £153.1 million and contrasted this with the allocation of £149.026 million.  He stated that it would not be possible to maintain the service at 1990 levels.  He explained the tight controls which would operate in regard to cash flow which would result in the Board being confronted at an early stage with the problem of pegging back the level of services.</P>
    <P>That is irrefutable evidence that what the Minister is saying is wrong.  They are the people who have the responsibility for the health services and not Mr. Kenny. What does Mr. Kenny know about the health services?  What information or involvement has Mr. Kenny, Mr. Kennedy or Mr. Fox on the health services? They are different people with different qualifications.  It was said last night &mdash; and I said it previously &mdash; that the health service is now a supermarket operation, cost effective, value for money etc.</P>
    <P>Having heard of the provision for mentally handicapped people I feel obliged to say that I have a letter which was submitted to the Southern Health Board, signed by social workers representing various groups within the Southern Health Board &mdash; the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Cork Spastic Clinic, the Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Cork Regional Hospital social workers and the Mercy Hospital &mdash; in which they said:</P>
    <P>We have become increasingly aware of the discrepancy between the demand for and the availability of services to meet the growing number of young chronic sick and disabled people.  There are two groups about whom we are concerned.  One group consists of about 110 people living at home potentially at serious risk.</P>
    <P>Those people cannot be provided for by a health board with a shortfall of over £4 million.</P>
    <P>The other aspect I would refer to is the home help service provided for the parents of mentally retarded children.  In my own area, and right across the east Cork section of that area, a number of <Col N="1949" /> mothers are getting home help service from one or two social workers.  In mid-1990 the board were advised that the service would have to be cut.  The allocation from the health board to the Wheelchair Association was reduced. Consequently the social worker service is to all intents and purposes not available to mothers caring for mentally handicapped babies.  The Minister stands indicted and condemned on those issues. The sooner he faces up to that fact the better for all and sundry.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister not received the INO submissions and has he not seen their public pronouncements?  Has he not received a request from the Southern Health Board, first, to meet the parliamentary party members who are members of that board and, secondly, as was decided at their last meeting a broad based delegation who would represent the board?  Why has the Minister not received those delegations to enable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the chairman and chief executive officer of the board on numerous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>That is different to meeting with the representatives of the board.  I believe the Minister is telling the chairman and chief executive officers of the boards what is happening but he is not meeting any delegations.</P>
      <P>I want to put it on the record that most people believe that 39 per cent of the population of this State have full eligibility to free health services.  That was the case up to about the mid-eighties but this figure was reduced to 33.55 per cent by 1989 and to 32.63 per cent by 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is 37 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The national average is 34.99 per cent.  If the Minister is getting his statistics from a different source I would be glad to stand corrected on this issue.  This is a vast reduction in the number of people who are eligible to <Col N="1950" /> a free health service.  People are being turned away from hospitals every other day.  People who are marginally over the limits have had their applications for medical cards turned down.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the position in regard to the mentally handicapped and long-stay patients.  Great emphasis was placed in the programme for the care of the elderly on the appointment of additional public health nurses.  The number of public health nurses in the area I represent is far below the national average. Increasing the number of health nurses by one or two in a very large district will not rectify the problems.  No provision had been made for beds for long-stay geriatric patients even though this recommendation was made by the Commission on Health Funding.  This recommendation should be taken on board by the Minister straight away.</P>
      <P>In the late seventies an application made by St. Patrick's Hospital in Fermoy for more beds was sent back to the board to be modified just because the official in the Department thought the cost was a bit high.  The matter has rested there since then.  Consequently there is a chronic problem in this hospital in regard to the provision of beds for long-stay patients.  The use of beds as respite beds is no solution to that problem.  In 1989 the Southern Health Board made the provision of an additional 20 beds for Mallow General Hospital a priority but to this day no move has been made by the Department in this regard.  Little children who are hospitalised are being accommodated in the same wards as adults. This situation cannot be tolerated and I ask the Minister to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the &lsquo;flu epidemic was blamed for the chaos in our hospitals.  This year there is no epidemic yet the health boards and patients are facing a crisis every bit as serious as that of a year ago.  Health boards simply cannot maintain services on the basis of the funds provided to them by the Government.  The inevitable outcome of this will be longer waiting lists, more beds in corridors, the early discharge of patients, longer closure of <Col N="1951" /> beds and wards during holiday periods, a worsening of the plight of the physically and mentally handicapped and even less money for child care services and facilities for the elderly.</P>
    <P>The Minister sits in the comfort of his office in the Custom House repeating parrot like that &ldquo;there is no crisis&rdquo;, totally ignoring the reality being experienced every day in the health service by doctors, nurses and administrators who have to cope with the chaos resulting from his disastrous policies and especially from his refusal to acknowledge the need for increased funding.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the reality of the situation. As I have previously stated, at the end of January the members of my health board were informed by board officials, following a meeting with the Department, that they were proposing a reduction in the level of activity to that operating at the end of 1989.  This is in clear conflict with the commitment given to the Dáil by the Minister before Christmas that all health boards&lsquo; services would be maintained at their 1990 level.</P>

      <P>It does not look like the Minister can do that unless he increases the allocation to the health board.</P>
      <P>Other proposals involved the longer holiday and seasonal closure of beds, an increased range of surgical and medical procedures to be undertaken on a day basis, the elimination of what were described as &ldquo;unnecessary tests&rdquo; and the temporary deferment of the filling of some vacancies.  Under the proposals there would be no additional money for the physically handicapped or for child care services.  The Minister of State referred to the position in regard to child care services.  What additional finances have the health boards got to implement the proposals in this regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The same problems are being experienced by hospitals all over the country.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19 February carried a report signed by the Chairman of the Mater Hospital's Medical Council which gave a graphic account of the problems facing that hospital.  He stated:</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, the number of patients awaiting admission and remaining overnight in the accident and emergency department has increased.  This in turn has given rise to inadequate supervision of patients that are left unattended on trollies in various cubicles whilst the nurses and medical staff attend to other patients.</P>
      <P>Arising from this, staff numbers in the department are unable to monitor patients appropriately.  It is not unusual to find two patients per cubicle, either being assessed for admission or awaiting admission.  This practice is humiliating for the patient, the patient's relatives and is an extreme embarrassment for all the staff concerned.</P>
      <P>It is not a public representative who is creating that scaremongering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party have never suggested that additional spending on its own would create a better health service. Combined with the restructuring of the health services additional funding can give the Irish people the quality and range of service they need.  The proportion of gross national product spent on public health has been steadily declining.  Unless <Col N="1953" /> there is a commitment to bring the level of spending back up to what it was in a planned and phased way the problem will remain.  In 1983 public health spending accounted for 7.61 per cent of GNP.  This figure was gradually brought down to 7.1 per cent in 1986, 6.6 per cent in 1987, 6.24 per cent in 1988 and less than 6 per cent in 1989.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party, noting that the percentage of gross national product allocated to public health services has declined significantly since the mid-eighties and that many of the problems now being experienced in our hospitals are a direct result of years of under funding and believing that adequate health services cannot be provided on the cheap, call on the Government to move towards a target figure for health expenditure of the OECD average in terms of percentage of GNP.  They further call on the Government to make an immediate cash allocation available to those health boards who are facing a shortfall and to introduce a proper reform plan for the health services based on numerous studies now available on the need for structural reform.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister's very detached speech a short time ago one would be forgiven for thinking there were no patients in this city, for example, who are waiting up to two years for heart operations, that there are not 10,000 people waiting for orthodontic treatment and that there are no parents <Col N="1954" /> trying to tackle the problems of handicapped children.  It is very easy to make a detached speech when you are not on the suffering side of the health crisis we are now facing.  About a week ago in this House I raised the case of a three and a half year old child whose parents were told he would have to wait a year for a tonsils operation in St. Michael's Hospital in Dún Laoghaire.  A couple of years ago he would not have had to wait that long&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not, and I will give the reason.  At that time Monkstown Hospital was open but it has been closed since by this Government, the children's ward in St. Michael's Hospital was closed down by this Government, and as a result there are now over 100 children waiting for a tonsils operation in that hospital.  In the same period, the maternity unit in St. Columcill's Hospital, Loughlinstown, was closed down, leaving no maternity hospital from Wexford town to Holles Street.  In his reply to me a week ago the Minister of State referred to a review of hospital services in south-east Dublin. That reference worried me because I fear that even the limited hospital services that at present exist in the Dún Laoghaire area will be further diminished.  I would like the Minister to give an assurance that that will not happen because, should it happen, it will not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the Labour Party amendment.  One proposal in that amendment surprised me &mdash; the reference to cancelling the purchase of Carysfort College.  While I share the reservations of the Labour Party about the circumstances surrounding the purchase of the college, the cost of it and so on, the position would be much worse if it is not purchased since it would revert back to private ownership and would probably end up in private use.  I am a little surprised to find that proposal included in <Col N="1955" /> an amendment dealing with the health services.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Sherlock for affording me a few moments to add a further point of reality to this debate.  In the face of the many criticisms levelled at the Minister and his Department by Deputy Sherlock in respect of inadequate services, the Minister retorted across the floor that he has honoured the many commitments he made over the past four years.  That may be his view, but I want to instance two cases in my constituency that have come to my attention in the last week which suggest that commitments do not seem to be enough and that a lot more needs to be done.  The first instance concerns a young boy of six years of age from Darndale who called to the Mater ear and throat clinic in August of last year needing an urgent tonsillitis operation; he was told he would have to wait for six to eight weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but I have a very short time available to me.  The Minister can comment all he likes later and I hope he will resolve the matter.  This boy is still awaiting a tonsillitis operation. He is missing days from school.  He is suffering from severe throat and other ailments and is now facing impairment of his hearing.  All this has been witnessed and attested to directly by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second instance concerns a boy of similar age from the Howth area who called to Temple Street Hospital on 11 <Col N="1956" /> May last year when he was advised he would be put on a list of approximately 80 children in need of operative treatment to their ears.  This unfortunate child has extremely protruding ears and, no doubt the Minister can appreciate, while it is not life threatening, nonetheless, makes the boy's existence in the community and the school which he attends somewhat difficult at times.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month the parents of this boy checked with the hospital to find out the position and were told his name had been removed from the list.  When I made inquiries of the hospital I was advised that there are now between 250 and 300 patients of similar age on the waiting list for this type of treatment.  The consultant who wrote to me gave the following explanation:</P>
    <P>It is a common misconception that waiting lists are like bus queues.  As I am sure you are aware, more urgent problems skip the queue so that, in effect, less urgent problems do not move in the queue at all and may even start moving backwards.</P>
    <P>That is the level to which our medical services in this city have been reduced. There are queues which are moving backwards.</P>

      <P>The debate to date and the contributions from the Minister and the Minister of State have been along usual lines in debates such as this.  We have come to expect that form of verbiage from the Department.  It is quite obvious the Minister and Minister of State are out of touch with what is happening in the administration of the health services.  We had a nice piece of political posturing from the Minister's colleague, Deputy Quill.  She was quite right in assuming that health services would be the Achilles' heel of this Government.  She is aware, of course, as is any good politician, that there are local elections impending.  The Minister should take note that less political posturing and more resources for the health services might be rewarding in the local elections.</P>
      <P>Any debate on the health services must focus on the patients' requirements and the capacity of the Minister to meet these requirements.  Because of the Minister's appalling disregard for patients and because the question of access to health services is one the Minister would prefer to ignore, the patient has been removed from centre stage in this debate and replaced by lies, damn lies and statistics. I want tonight to restore the patient to centre stage, to bring home to the Minister the fear and anxiety, the pain and suffering and the sense of hopelessness and rejection felt by the suffering patients.</P>

Yet the Government, apparently with the blind support of all the Government backbenchers, have the audacity to table an amendment commending the Minister for providing additional resources, for taking radical and reforming action and for maintaining the level of services.  The Fianna Fáil and progressive Democrats Parties are burying their heads in the sand because the Government have failed the patient dismally in their handling of the health services.</P>
      <P>The Minister has bled the health services dry while failing to eliminate waste in administration.  Do we need eight health boards?  Why does the Minister not do something about reforming administration and reallocating the saved money to treatment of additional patients and providing more beds and nurses in the health services?  The Minister is neither radical nor reforming.  He is like Nero, the old Roman Emperor, fiddling and dithering while the health services wither before our eyes.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;will have 1,000 fewer admissions in 1991 than in 1990 and that is not maintaining the level of services. The Minister, of course, is not alone in his remove from reality.  If any of his backbench colleagues had the interests of the patient at heart, they would take him by the hand into the real world.  However, they too have thrown in the towel and shamefully succumbed to the ethos that nothing can be done for the suffering patients.  Fine Gael do not accept that. We believe that access to medical care should be determined by need and not by the size of one's bank balance.  There should be one waiting list for public and private patients.  Resources must be concentrated on front line services in relieving pain and suffering, not squandered through inaction in administration and greed.</P>
      <P>We do not want consultants hogging health debates; we want more beds, more nurses and more patients catered for and taken off unacceptably long waiting lists. Above all we firmly believe that the Minister, after four years, does not show any signs of understanding the fundamental issues.

      <P>I should like to thank my colleague for allowing me time to contribute.  In supporting this motion I will briefly deal with two points and I am sure it will not be a surprise to the Minister that one of them concerns the mentally handicapped, a group of people in whom I am particularly interested and whose problems will not be solved by a stay in hospital or by pills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's events, where parents of handicapped people forcibly occupied the offices of the Department of Health with their children indicate a very serious <Col N="1960" /> problem and a degree of frustration seldom seen in any campaign.  This group of ordinary people &mdash; ordinary parents &mdash; who came together only one and a half years ago to highlight the needs for residential accommodation for the handicapped took this action because they felt no one was listening.  No one condones any group breaking the law and when it is a group involving severely handicapped young people, many of whom are in wheelchairs, it has to be remarkable.  The people involved in today's protest have a just cause and they want a meaningful, practical response, not £1 million or £2 million as a stopgap.  They have held public meetings, visited TDs' clinics and gone on the streets with their children. Does the Minister understand how painful this is for parents in that position?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is a caring man who is familiar with the stress which a handicapped person creates in a family. However, this group was tired of sympathy and their need is to transfer caring &mdash; however good &mdash; into practical action. The Minister must allocate the necessary £9 million investment in residential accommodation to cater for the waiting list about which he has been told again and again in the Dublin area.  If necessary, this allocation should be made out of national lottery funds.  It is precisely this type of use that people who buy tickets and subscribe to the lottery want to see their proceeds going.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill said that the health area is the Achilles' heel of the Government, and handicapped people are the Minister's Achilles' heel.  I appeal to Fianna Fáil not to hide in a bunker and hope that the handicap issue will go away as that party did in relation to the haemophiliac group some time ago.  It is now an issue of public concern among people not personally involved and it is the test of the Government's real commitment to health spending rather than the aspirational one incorporated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak very briefly about <Col N="1961" /> yesterday's court case on the sale of condoms. The Dublin District Court decision yesterday on the sale of condoms was regrettable.  It places an onus on this House to change our family planning Acts to ensure that contraceptives can be more freely available.  We are truly living in a Victorian age when our laws penalise people for being responsible in their sexual habits.  Fianna Fáil have great difficulty in this area and seem to have a pathological dread of the word &ldquo;condom&rdquo;.  It seems to send a tremour through them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was legislation which the Deputy's party introduced which was dealt with in court yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil share the notion that family planning is a women's problem but it is not.  They said so in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  They put family planning under &ldquo;Women's Health Services&rdquo; and said that operation of family planning services would be kept under review in association with the relevant organisations.  Family planning and contraceptives are not women's issues, they are issues for everybody. If condoms and other forms of non-medical contraceptives were readily available and promoted by the Department of Health, there would be fewer women on the pill, which is not good for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Condoms, as far as I know, are the only means of male contraception and we must do something in this House to make them more freely available.  I hope that changes in family planning laws will be made in a mature and enlightened way for many reasons, including AIDS, the increase in people diagnosed as HIV positive and the broader reason that people need contraceptives to prevent pregnancy.  I am not over-confident, however.  I recall the disgraceful opportunism of Fianna Fáil when, in 1985, the Coalition Government effected necessary &mdash; but minimal &mdash; reform.  We made <Col N="1962" /> changes but I regret that we did not go far enough.  The onus is now on the parties opposite to take the matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation tonight is very depressing.  The Minister said last night that he must distinguish between demands and needs and fund the latter. Does the Minister regard people staying overnight on trollies in humiliating circumstances in the Mater Hospital as a need or a demand?  Is it a need or a demand that hundreds of mentally handicapped children are going without any service and that their parents do not have any respite care?  Is it acceptable that people have to wait up to two years for cardiac surgery?  Is that a need or a demand?  Any reasonable person listening to the Minister recognises that he is out of touch with what is happening.  He could be forgiven if he was not getting advice but the Minister's response to the advice from the health professionals is summarised in his conclusion that health agencies are always looking for additional funding.  He has refused to even address any of the detailed reports from each health board as to the defects they have to face this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South-Eastern Health Board will have to cut hospital admissions by 8,000. That is the reality, it is in their report and the Minister should read it.  The Minister fraudulently announced that he will maintain approved levels of service in 1991 but everyone in the House knows that that means there will be fewer hospital admissions this year.  That means, in consequence, longer waiting lists and there is no getting away from it.  It is misleading to come in here and talk about a 7 per cent increase in the approved allocation.  Every health board can say that last year, with Government sanction, they spent much more than their approved levels because there was a crisis.  Now the Minister is squeezing that back from the system.  It is ironic that the Minister, who allowed his Taoiseach to face an election in 1989 ignorant of the <Col N="1963" /> crisis in the health services, should ask his councillors to go into the same electoral arena ignorant of the true crisis in the services.  Perhaps what we heard from the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, is the signal that the Minister is keeping back a little money and will look at additional needs closer to the local elections.  What sort of management is that to offer to our services?  We have professionals in the services seeking to plan on a long term basis.</P>
    <P>We have known for years that we need multi-year planning but the Minister has refused to do so.  We have known for years that we do not have a proper structure for community care but the Minister has not acted on it.  We have known for years that we do not have adequate management systems in our hospitals but the Minister has not acted on that.  He now expects applause from the House for saying he read the Fox report and will take some of those suggestions up.</P>

      <P>Those issues were identified five years ago by his own Department in a worthwhile document on the wider dimensions of the health provision. He has done nothing about that document, he is providing more consultants <Col N="1964" /> to again look at the problems which were identified then and he sits on his hands. The Minister is immune to what is happening to many people who will have to deal with early discharges which will be the necessary consequences of his action. That is the reality of what we will face this year.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about the publication of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  However, responding to that, the general secretary of the INO said that the reduction of moneys in this year's health services could only be seen as a direct contradiction of the spirit and intent of that programme.  That is the reaction from the professionals in the service which councillors will face during the year.</P>
      <P>There are very few specifics in the programme but one is that the Minister will take the 1,500 mentally handicapped people who are inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals out of those hospitals. Within a week of that programme the Minister announced he was reneging on that, he was not going to do that. That was a direct quote from the Minister reported in the papers and not denied by him.  We have fraudulent presentation here tonight.  The Minister is going back on commitments given to the social partners and he will pay the price for that.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Finglas (Dublin) Industrial Dispute.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The strike in River Valley Products in Finglas in my constituency involves a relatively small number of people directly &mdash; just 12 &mdash; but the issues raised by the dispute are of national importance and affect a huge number of workers, most of whom are women.  The dispute also raises very serious questions about the policy of FÁS in regard to the placement of young workers and the operation of the new Industrial Relations Act.  It is appropriate that we should have this Adjournment Debate tonight on the eve of the introduction of the part-time workers Bill by the Minister tomorrow in this House, because those who are now on strike in River Valley Products are typical of a huge number of part-time workers who have been shamefully exploited by unscrupulous employers in the absence of appropriate protective legislation.</P>
      <P>The 12 women who are now on strike worked as regular part-time general operatives at River Valley Products.  They were employed for 17½ hours per week, just 30 minutes per week below the threshold necessary to qualify for redundancy, unfair dismissal and maternity leave claims.  Just before Christmas they were let go.  However, when one of the women workers returned to collect pay she found that five young male workers were doing the exact same work from which they had been let go.</P>
      <P>Annoyance turned to anger when the women discovered that these youths had been employed through an advertisement placed in a FÁS centre in Finglas and were being paid £1.50 per hour, more than £1 an hour less than the women had been earning.  This raised very serious questions about the diligence and practices adopted by FÁS.  I accept that FÁS may not have been aware when they agreed to place the advertisement that the recruits were going to replace women workers who had been let go.  At the same time there is clearly an obligation on FÁS to do some sort of vetting of prospective employers to ensure that young people desperate for jobs are not taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers and especially to ensure that recruits are not replacing regular and better paid employees.  There is clearly a need for the Minister to intervene to ensure that procedures applied by FÁS do not allow for a repeat of the disgraceful circumstances at River Valley Products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the women discovered what had happened their union served strike notice and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions took such a serious view of the issue that they granted an all-out picket.  It is noteworthy that this employer has only demonstrated his contempt for the efforts of the new labour relations commission to resolve this dispute.  He has refused to <Col N="1971" /> deal directly with the trade union involved, SIPTU, and most regrettably he has been successful in resorting to the 1990 Industrial Relations Act in order to try to undermine the effectiveness of the strike by getting a High Court injunction under the new Act to prevent what is called &ldquo;inducement to breach of contract&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is clearly wrong that an employer who is blatantly exploiting labour in order to undermine a legitimate trade dispute, cannot be made amenable to the usual industrial relations procedures.  If this were a high profile enterprise the Minister would have already intervened.  The rights of these low paid women are just as important as those of any other citizen and they have the right to expect the same level of protection as any other group of workers.</P>
    <P>The strike is now in its second month and with the company showing no sign of wishing to settle I would appeal to the Minister to see what steps can be taken to force the company to see reason.  We must also ensure that legislation is passed rapidly to ensure that this sort of exploitation of the most vulnerable section of the workforce is ended.  The Bill which will be debated in the Dáil tomorrow will be a step in the right direction but unscrupulous employers will, I fear, still be able to find ways through it.</P>
    <P>Employers and trade unions have just agreed a new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which has been ratified by the Dáil.  The programme places certain obligations on the trade union movement and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are expected to ensure that trade unions behave in a responsible manner.  There must also be an obligation on the employer organisations to see that the sort of activities highlighted by this strike are not engaged in by any employer with which they are associated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record, the dispute concerns the replacement of 15 female part-time employees who worked 17½ hours per <Col N="1972" /> week as Deputy De Rossa has said, by five male full-time employees on lower hourly rates.  It was normal practice for the part-timers to be laid off in December and re-employed in March but on this occasion they were replaced in January by full-time workers.  This came to the attention of the union, SIPTU, who sought an explanation from management on the new working arrangements.  In the absence of what they would regard as a satisfactory response, SIPTU called an official dispute and placed pickets on the company on 18 January.</P>
      <P>On 1 February the Labour Relations Commission invited the parties to talks. After some hours of discussion management withdrew to obtain legal advice, and to date the commission have been unable to organise further talks.</P>
      <P>For the information of Deputy De Rossa, who perhaps wishes that I become involved directly, shortly after the dispute started, members of the staff came and met me at an advice centre and I had two long discussions with them, following those discussions the Labour Relations Commission have been trying to reach a solution.  The staff explained to me the full details of the contracts they had and the times when they might and might not be laid off.  I am aware of the full details, but I do not think some of those points are particularly relevant.  I do agree with the Deputy that even though the dates were fixed and even though the staff knew of the position, it was still extremely sharp practice by the employer involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, this dispute recently gave rise to legal proceedings. While an injunction was granted restraining SIPTU from inducing its members in other employments supplied by the company to breach a commercial contract, the court found that there was a trade dispute in existence and the picketing could continue.  What is involved in this dispute is primarily an industrial relations issue and while recourse to the courts may have been deemed necessary, the best means of <Col N="1973" /> resolving the dispute is through the industrial relations machinery, that is the Labour Relations Commission and, if necessary, the Labour Court, as we pointed out to the company and SIPTU. I therefore call again on the parties involved to reconsider their positions and enter into meaningful discussions, because the continuation of the dispute cannot be of benefit either to the company or to the workforce.  It is not too difficult to imagine from talking to the people involved or those trying to resolve the problem what will happen if they continue in the position that both sides are now in.  I have pointed out already that the Labour Relations Commission have been involved and remains available to the parties at short notice and we have made that very clear to them.  I therefore appeal to both sides and to the management, in particular, to use the machinery which has been made available to assist, in this situation.</P>
    <P>I should point out that I have at present before the Dáil the part-time workers Bill, which Deputy De Rossa has mentioned and which will give part-time workers working eight hours per week the same protection under labour law as their full-time colleagues.  However, it is only fair that I should say, having seen the correspondence and the contracts and agreements they had, it may not resolve all of the difficulties but it certainly will in a great number of these cases.</P>
    <P>As regards FÁS, the first indication I heard of their involvement was from the individuals concerned and I investigated it because I was concerned about it.  I am satisfied that the FÁS office in Finglas acted in good faith in facilitating the two placements with the the employer who placed the advertisement with them. They were aware of the employer in the area but when the background to the vacancy became known, I understand that FÁS immediately approached the company requesting information on the background and placed the remaining <Col N="1974" /> vacancies on hold; this remains the situation. In actual fact, two of the positions as I understand it, were filled by people who came from FÁS.</P>
    <P>It would probably be impossible to formulate guidelines to address the situation in isolated cases.  However, because of this and other disputes where employers try to use the system, we have tried to see in what way we can stop this abuse. It would be practically impossible for the FÁS offices, which are fairly hard pushed from a staff point of view, to check every individual vacancy.  They, like any organisation, have a hit list of companies that they particularly watch, but in this case the company was not too far away from the FÁS office and they believed they were on safe enough ground, and accepted their bona fides.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy De Rossa that FÁS do not allow people who have been laid off to be replaced by short time workers.  It was for this very reason, a few years back that I stopped the work experience programme, because I found there were gross abuses.  Perhaps this is another way around the regulations.  We certainly will do all we can to stop such abuses.  Abuses greatly upset the FÁS staff involved because they are involved with the community and there is goodwill between them and the community; certainly the people in Finglas have good relationships with the industries and want to have that and do not want to get involved with somebody who abuses the system.</P>
    <P>Finally, it will be a matter for industrial relations to resolve this dispute.  I would like to appeal to the company to realise that if they are to get anywhere in an official strike with the biggest union, SIPTU, they must use the Labour Relations Commission and I urge them to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me <Col N="1975" /> permission to raise on the Adjournment this urgent and important matter of the proposed community school in Cashel.</P>
      <P>When I spoke on this subject in February 1990, and yet again in November 1990, little did I realise that on 27 February 1991, not only would there have been no progress achieved with the community school in Cashel but, worse still, the situation would have deteriorated even further so that we now find ourselves locked in a legal tangle between the Department of Education and the quantity surveyors.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister for Education is not present here tonight to hear this debate, but I can assure her there is no escape from this issue and there is no means of avoiding the anger and the frustration of the people of Cashel.  I will, however, admit that the present mess is not of the Minister's making and I expect and hope that she is as disappointed as I am with the current situation.  However, though our sympathy towards the Minister is willingly given, it does not alter our request, or indeed our demand, that the Cashel community school must be provided urgently and without delay and the responsibility for this rests entirely on the Minister's shoulders.</P>
      <P>The deplorable conditions of the Presentation Convent in Cashel are well known to the Minister.  I will, however, remind her that this school has poor, unhealthy sanitation; it is a fire hazard; it has no entrance for a fire brigade; it has grossly inadequate classrooms; there is constant flooding in the pedestrian area of the school premises; and there is no ventilation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past two months have seen the situation disimprove still further.  In fact, one whole section of the school building is now without electricity supply and will remain without it unless a total rewiring job is carried out on the entire building. It has been judged unsafe to use any <Col N="1976" /> electrical appliances or even to turn on the light.</P>
    <P>The result is that five classes now have to be taught in daylight &mdash; not always adequate or dependable.  No equipment, such as record players, tape recorders or overhead projectors can be used.  Yet these students are expected to compete in State examinations with their counterparts who have the facilities that are not only necessary but vital for participation or good results in State examinations.</P>
    <P>Added to these appalling conditions I have outlined, there are 98 students on the streets in Cashel every day moving from one school to another to avail of optional subjects.  Some of these students move between schools three times a day in hail, rain, sleet, snow or sunshine. I would like to say to the Minister for Education that this is just not on.  I believe the Minister will agree that the appalling conditions for post-primary education in Cashel are not only undesirable but totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>On 28 November 1990, the management of the three schools &mdash; the Presentation Convent, the Christian Brothers school and the vocational school &mdash; along with the parents' representatives in a meeting with the Minister for Education were assured that the problem of the quantity surveyor would not be solved in the future but would be solved in a day or two.  Three months later the problem remains unresolved and matters have deteriorated further.  Cashel cannot wait until this legal mess is sorted out.</P>

      <P>Cashel should not be asked to wait until a solution is found to a departmental problem.  What is the current situation?  Are the Department moving away from the new departure of design, build and finance?  The most important question here tonight is when will the community school in Cashel commence? I am asking the Minister to include the Cashel project in the current <Col N="1977" /> capital programme.  Having waited since 1976, having shown immense co-operation with the new departure, Cashel now deserves priority on her agenda.</P>
      <P>The anger and frustration of parents, teachers, students and school managers in Cashel cannot be over-estimated.  The present deadlock in the school development is not only causing a mounting tide of impatience and intolerance, but worse still there is a sense of despair and desperation. The people of Cashel implore the Minister to put Cashel as a priority on the agenda and to sanction the school immediately.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to put the record straight in relation to this particular project. Deputy Ahearn said she accepts that this is not of the Minister's making.  I think it is important that that is repeated here tonight.  This is not of the Minister's making.  Having said that, I must say that I was a bit surprised at some of the Deputy's language.  She knows exactly what the situation is.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the new community school for Cashel is that the tendering for the project has been interrupted, as Deputy Ahearn probably knows, because of a difficulty encountered by the developers asked to tender in obtaining the use of a bill of quantities prepared for the project by a consultant quantity surveyor.  My Department have been engaged in discussions with the quantity surveyor and the Construction Industry Federation, which represent the developers concerned, in an effort to get them to come to an arrangement that will satisfy both sides and resolve the difficulty.  As a result of these discussions a draft agreement has been submitted by the quantity surveyor and is currently being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Ahearn said, a number of legal issues have arisen out of these matters and these are being examined by the <Col N="1979" /> Department's legal advisers at present. Again, I repeat that the Minister cannot be held to blame for this situation.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances that I have outlined, I am not in a position at present to indicate what course of action will be taken to proceed with this project. However, I am extremely concerned to ensure that the problem is resolved as quickly as possible and I can assure the House that every effort will be made to find a solution as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>To date, we have had continued rumours and speculation regarding the decision of Telecom Éireann to increase telephone charges. The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications has remained coy and silent on this issue.  I now feel it is time he clarified the position and put an end to these rumours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speculation suggests that Telecom has decided to introduce a wide range of increases in telephone charges which will affect all sections of our community.  The proposed increase in local call charges will have a major impact on the lives of families, particularly the elderly, the unemployed, and the disabled.  This increase will also drastically curtail the activities of voluntary agencies, such as the Samaritans, Alone and Childline whose essential work relies heavily on the communication process.  These voluntary organisations which have filled large gaps in our society &mdash; in many respects these gaps are due to Government cutbacks <Col N="1980" />&mdash; will find themselves in an intolerable position.</P>
    <P>It must also be remembered that the business world will also feel the negative consequences of the alleged charge increases; this may manifest itself in the loss of jobs in some cases.  None of the indications suggest that these charges will mean any improvement to people living in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Bord Telecom are a successful profitable company and the speculated charge increases will further increase this profitability. It has been suggested that the projected profits for Telecom Éireann in 1991 will be in the region of £100 million. Is this a case of fattening and increasing the attractiveness of Telecom for eventual privatisation?  We, in the Labour Party, want answers from the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications. Will he clarify this issue? Are the proposed user charge increases a prelude to the privatisation of Telecom, and will he inform the House how these cost structures will impinge on the ordinary people?  It has been suggested that Telecom Éireann intend to reduce trunk call charges for rural areas.  This is a proposal we would welcome.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann should immediately reduce the rental charge by 10 per cent and increase the connection rate.  Many people are now excluded because of the outlandish rental charge and if there was a 10 per cent reduction I have no doubt it would increase the number of subscribers. The rental charge is a fixed payment, irrespective of use, and while in theory this is set to recover capital expenditure, current and projected profits will allow for a reduction which will benefit those on moderate incomes most. If Telecom are concerned about reducing the basic cost of the service I suggest this is the area that should be given first priority.</P>
    <P>Telecom should not introduce a differential tariff structure for local calls. This is a policy which a private operator would adopt.  We must bear in mind that <Col N="1981" /> Telecom Éireann is not a private entity, it was created for the Irish people by the taxpayer and they should reap the benefits.  I would now ask the Government to come clean on this matter.  There has been much speculation, jobs are being threatened and it is in the interests of everybody that we put an end to the rumours once and for all.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply will give me some of the details I have requested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy O'Sullivan giving me some of his time.  I support his request to the Minister.  The people I know are totally opposed to the timing of local calls and I have had many representations on that issue.  I would urge the Minister to listen very carefully. When people telephone the ESB to query their bills or the Department of Social Welfare, they may be left waiting for some time.</P>
      <P>Because of the number of telephones in the country the income generated should be sufficient to lower the cost of local and international calls rather than increasing them.  Without putting too fine an edge on it, I want to tell the Minister that any change in the system of local calls in regard to timing will be resented by thousands of telephone users.  I believe that if given the choice between increasing the cost of a local call by 1p and a system where the local calls were timed &mdash; I am not advocating this &mdash; people would opt for the 1p increase, although I do not see any need for an increase in telephone charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take very seriously the many representations which have already come to me from people with young families.  When they are out the children telephone each other with the result that their telephone bills will be enormous and they will suffer great hardship.  It is most important that we have a telephone service not only for the elderly living alone but in order that people can communicate with each other. <Col N="1982" /> Again, I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for allowing me some of his time.</P>

      <P>As indicated by the then Minister for Communications in response to parliamentary questions on 30 January and 5 February this year, Telecom Éireann have submitted proposals for a revised tariff system for certain telephone charges and these proposals are at present being examined by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to go into details of these proposals while they are still under consideration. However, the Deputies who have raised this question can be assured that the social and economic consequences of Telecom Éireann's proposals will be taken into account by the Minister before a final decision is taken.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that this decision will be taken shortly.</P>

      <P>Because of the excellent arterial drainage job being done by the Office of Public Works upstream in the Boyle catchment area, problems are being created downstream between Lough Gara and Lough Key.  Regular widespread flooding occurs on the Sligo side and the Roscommon side.  This is now routine after exceptional and even after average rainfall and it originates from the arterial drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The source of the problem seems to be twofold.  The first cause is the improved drainage, resulting in a quicker run-off from tributaries upstream from Lough Gara.  The second cause is the siltation of the Boyle River which I have seen and <Col N="1983" /> examined.  I appeal to the Minister of State to have this relatively minor work done to help the farmers along the banks and to remove an unfortunate side effect from an otherwise very well executed job of arterial drainage work.</P>

      <P>The current scheme of works which is being done on the Boyle system will include maintenance works on the sections completed previously.  These sections will also be included in future maintenance programmes when the Boyle catchment drainage scheme has been completed.</P>

      <P>While the President of the EC Commission has referred to the need to ensure that employers receive fair wages he has not called for the introduction of a European-wide minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The introduction of EC-wide minimum wage legislation would, I consider, not be a feasible development since wage levels are primarily determined by the conditions prevailing in each labour market.  Furthermore, I am not convinced that such a development is the solution to the problem of low pay.</P>
      <P>As I have previously stated, measures to tackle this problem must cover a range of areas such as education, training, social benefits and taxation as well as the question of pay.  A major contribution can also be made by increasing the level of job opportunities available.</P>
      <P>Pay and employment creation policies are central to the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  A special feature of the programme's pay provisions is that those on low incomes will receive proportionally higher pay increases than those on higher incomes. These increases, together with improvements in the family income supplement and income tax reductions, will result in substantial benefit to the low paid.</P>
      <P>The programme also provides that during the next three years the Employer-Labour Conference will consider all the issues relating to a statutory minimum wages, including the operation of the Joint Labour Committee system.</P>

      <P>FÁS were established under the Labour Services Act, 1987, to provide training and other manpower initiatives.  The Act also provides that FÁS should be governed by a board representative of the social partners, youth interests and relevant Government Departments together with employee representatives.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the boards are discharging their responsibilities in a competent and effective manner.  As requested by me at the first meeting of the board on 7 January 1988, FÁS have been reviewing their schemes and programmes in a systematic manner.  In relation to external training, I am aware that FÁS retained an independent consultant to review the procedures involved and to make recommendations as appropriate.  I am further aware that the consultant found that external training was a flexible and cost effective method of training for FÁS.  I fully accept this conclusion.</P>
      <P>Evaluating training in the global sense extends far beyond an evaluation of external training.  My approach is that training should prepare people not only for the jobs currently available, but also for those likely to become available in the future in Ireland, or within the European Community.  The question of equality of opportunity must also be taken into account when deciding the number of training opportunities to be provided even in times of limited employment opportunities.</P>

    <P>Discussions regarding VEC involvement in the provision of external training were held a few years ago between the former AnCo, my Department and the Department of Education.  This resulted <Col N="1841" /> in a greater involvement of VECs in the provision of external training courses.</P>

    <P>Of the 19 cases referred under the employment regulation orders five related to hotels, four to catering, four to hairdressing, two to agriculture, one each to women's clothing and millinery, law clerks, tailoring and contract cleaning. In one of these cases the employer was convicted, fined and ordered to pay the arrears due; eight are awaiting hearing; in five cases the arrears due were paid and proceedings withdrawn; in one case the company went into liquidation and arrears due to the 38 employees were paid from the social insurance fund; in two cases the employers are now outside the jurisdiction; and in two cases the employees failed to furnish sufficient evidence to successful prosecutions.  In relation to the six cases referred under the <Col N="1846" /> registered employment agreement for the security industry two were convicted and fined and four are awaiting hearing.</P>
    <P>At present the only employers in the retail sector who are required to pay a statutory minimum wage to their workers are those who come within the scope of the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Footwear, Drapery and Allied Trades Registered Employment Agreement.  This agreement rlates to establishments which are situated in the area of the County Borough of Dublin or the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and of which the business is the sale by wholesale or retail of one or more of the following classes of goods: footwear, clothing, headgear, drapery and haberdashery.  Rates of pay under this agreement range between £91.21 for a shop assistant to £169.07 for a chargehand and the hours of work are 75 hours per fortnight.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1990, significantly increased the fines for breaches of registered employment agreements and this coupled with a significant increase in staffing in the inspectorate of my Department has greatly improved enforcement of statutory minimum rates of pay generally.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will also, of course, be aware that the Labour Court have recently concluded an inquiry into an application as to whether a new joint labour committee should be established for the retail, grocery and allied trades and will shortly be issuing a decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>The basis of payment to sponsors of projects under the social employment scheme for materials and supervision was <Col N="1850" /> changed in July 1990.  Under the old basis, public sector sponsors could claim up to 42 per cent of the total wage bill for supervision-materials costs while voluntary sponsors could claim up to 15 per cent of the total wage bill for materials costs and 13 per cent for supervision costs.</P>
      <P>The new system provides that public sector sponsors may claim up to £27 per worker for materials and supervision while private sector sponsors may claim up to £10 per worker per week for materials and up to £155 per week for supervision of projects with five to 14 workers and up to £175 per week for projects with 15 or more workers.</P>
      <P>The new system applies to projects commencing after July 1990.  Projects which had already commenced at that time continue under the old system. Sponsors were advised of the changes as appropriate by FÁS.</P>

      <P>The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health are responsible for the enforcement of legislation governing the transport of dangerous substances by road.

      <P>In 1990, there were three spillages reported to the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health involving dangerous substances in transit.  The authority received no reports of any injuries associated with these spillages.</P>

    <P>The general protection of the public is governed by section 7 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which requires every employer and self-employed person to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that members of the public who may be affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their safety or health.  In addition, the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, and associated regulations set out detailed requirements for safe conveyance of dangerous substances.  A booklet published by my Department entitled <i>Guide to Conveyance of Dangerous Substances by Road</i> provides general guidance on the subject to employers and employees <Col N="1854" /> including drivers, consignors and carriers.

      <P>As I pointed out to the Deputy in my reply of 19 February 1991, internal value-added tax is collected centrally. As a consequence, the structure of the VAT computer file does not lend itself to the ready production of the type of statistics requested by the Deputy. However, in an effort to be as helpful as possible, the Revenue Commissioners will deploy some computer and personnel resources over the coming weeks to extract figures which will provide a reasonable indication of the breakdown of the total internal VAT yield in 1990 among the various districts.  I will let the Deputy have this information as soon as it is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed regarding the quality and burning characteristics of certain low smoke fuels which have been sold this winter on the greater Dublin market.  Damage to fire grates is alleged to have taken place in certain instances while sparks have been said to damage carpets, particularly at ignition times or when refuelling is taking place.  This has normally, but not solely, been associated with the burning of petcoke which, when used on its own, can burn with an intense heat.  In such cases, complainants have stated that the fuel is too hot for their purposes.  In other cases, it is claimed that consumers have had to spend more because there has not been sufficient heat from the fuels which they have used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few months, I and officials from my Department have had a series of discussions with representatives from the coal trade about the petcoke and about the quality and consumer satisfaction with other low smoke coals on the market.  The coal trade have voluntarily decided to withdraw petcoke from sale; it should now be available in Dublin only in a blended form.  Furthermore, I and my colleagues, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister with responsibility for environmental protection, will examine all possible measures, including information to and <Col N="1863" /> education of the consumer and the possibility of the formulation of a mandatory standard for petcoke blends and of optional standards for other coals to bring further information and consumer satisfaction to the whole situation.  I believe that overall the situation, subject to some lack of familiarity and dissatisfaction, is good and that low smoke fuels have made a notable contribution to Dublin's air.</P>

      <P>The position outlined by the Deputy is not correct.  The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year as outlined in the agreement between the Government and the INTO.  Creagh national school have the authorised staffing warranted by the enrolment for the current school year.  In addition, the school have the services of a shared remedial teacher and two special class assistants attached to the school.</P>
      <P>My Department have examined the current enrolment in this school and find that it is possible for the school to organise the classes to ensure that no class is in breach of the guidelines on maximum class size as set down by my Department.</P>
