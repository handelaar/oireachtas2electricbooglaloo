    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek some information from the Taoiseach in view of the fact that it now appears that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter <Col N="1130" /> Brooke, is to make a statement in the House of Commons today.  Will the Government provide time on Wednesday of next week to have a debate on Northern Ireland, on the statement and what comes from the House of Commons today?  Will the Taoiseach give some consideration to that?  Perhaps it can be discussed at the Whip's meeting today.</P>

      <P>In the wake of the decision of the Court of Appeal in England in the Guildford case the Government here established a commission under the chairmanship of Judge Martin and their report is with the Government who promised they would act on it without delay.  In view of the fact that the Birmingham Six case is to conclude today, if not tomorrow, it is hoped successfully, <Col N="1131" /> will the Taoiseach see to it that the Minister for Justice will bring forward legislation arising from the very concise and clear conclusions of the Martin Commission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, the Finance Bill is designed to give effect to the 1991 budget.  One of the major provisions of that budget has now been reversed by way of an announcement outside this House and there will be a forfeiture of £15 million.  Governments have fallen for less, I remind the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply inquiring, is it the intention of the Taoiseach to circulate with that document which gives effect to the budget a revised set of Estimates to explain how this deficit might be made up?</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach answer the second question?  It is in everybody's interest, particularly Opposition Members who are trying to assist the process of Government to which we are all committed.  If the Government want co-operation from this side of the House, in view of the general concern, it would be helpful if a revised set of Estimates is <Col N="1134" /> to be published, if the Taoiseach will indicate that.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1991: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for further significant improvements in our social welfare services and continues the Government's policy of care and support for those who depend on social welfare.  It provides for the increases in social welfare announced in the budget; the extension of social insurance benefits to part-time workers; the introduction of pro-rata pensions for people affected by mixed insurance; and other provisions to improve schemes and administration.</P>
      <P>Developments in social welfare in recent years have been broadly in line with the framework outlined by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Substantial progress has been made under each of the main headings identified by the Commission namely: improving basic payments, improving child income support, broadening the social insurance base, and improving the delivery of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite constraints in public expenditure, extra resources have been provided for social welfare.  These have been used mainly to improve rates of payment.  All payments have kept ahead of inflation. Special increases have been given to those on the lowest payments and groups with special needs, in particular families and the long term unemployed.  A number of new schemes have been introduced for groups with special needs for example the carer's allowance, lone parent's allowance, and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. This year again, particular attention has <Col N="1137" /> been given to workers on low incomes with families through further improvements in the family income supplement scheme and family tax exemptions.</P>
    <P>The new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has set the agenda for social welfare during the nineties.  It sets out to meet the needs identified by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Over the term of the programme, the Government are committed to improving the level of payments to the tune of £400 million in 1990 terms as the resources of the economy grow.  I am delighted that the first steps towards implementing the Social Welfare commitments in the programme have been taken in this year's Bill.  Much has been said about whether one is better off at work.  Those representatives in Fine Gael should make their minds up now about whether they want to give increases to those who are unemployed and others dependent on social welfare.  They should not at the start of business complain about taxation and social welfare and then say during a debate on the Social Welfare Bill that they want increasing social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>The Deputies should make up their minds as to what they want.  I want to set the record straight on a number of misleading headlines in the media recently.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that there are no incentives for the unemployed to go back to work.  That is patently untrue.  While unemployment has increased substantially since 1987, by 28 per cent in real terms, we have also ensured that people are better off working than on the dole &mdash; up to 40 per cent better off.  This was achieved by boosting the family income supplement and by introducing family tax exemptions for lower paid workers to the tune of £16.5 million.  That is a substantial increment for those at work on low pay.</P>
      <P>A number of hypothetical models have been used in recent media speculation. But let us look at the situation of real people.  A family at work with four children and earning £160 a week gross will now end up with £175.20 a week cash.  This is £44.20 a week more than if they were receiving unemployment benefit. A family at work with four children and earning £180 a week gross will end up with £168.45 a week cash.  They are £35.08 a week better off than if they were receiving unemployment benefit with pay related benefit.  A young person getting a job at £115 a week is still some £36.00 a week better off than on the dole.  That is after taking into consideration all PRSI, tax and other deductions.</P>
      <P>Through our progressive social policy over the last three years we have raised the real standard of living of both the unemployed and those families at work on low pay.  We have reached the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rates while increasing the incentive to work.  A four child family earning £160 per week in 1987 were only £22 better off at work than on the dole.  I would ask Deputy Bruton to note the fact that in 1991 that incentive to work has doubled to £44.20 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of loss of extra benefits for families if they go back to work has <Col N="1139" /> also been spoken about in a misleading way.  I want to put this into perspective as there is no point picking an odd case here and there and claiming this is true for all social welfare recipients.  I repeat, families on family income supplement do not lose the medical card and I ask Deputies to please convey that fact to those producing these hypothetical models so that they get their facts straight once and for all.  I am aware that they did lose the medical card during the term of office of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition but they do not lose it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Surveys have shown that only 5 per cent of unemployment benefit claimaints live in local authority houses. It is, therefore grossly misleading to suggest that a rise in differential rents is a major disincentive for all unemployed people.  The Commission on Social Welfare report, indicated that almost half of those on unemployment payments have no rent or mortgage.  Indeed, the much quoted four child family, the one Deputy Mitchell keeps talking about &mdash; I am so sorry he is not here listening to me &mdash; represents only 4 per cent of the total number of recipients of unemployment payments.  I appeal to the Deputies not to come back to the House again and again quoting hypothetical models and grossly misrepresenting the facts.  Let us stick to the facts and talk about the real needs of social welfare recipients.  It is a gross misrepresentation to use such an example to illustrate these so-called disincentives.  The facts are that people are much better off at work than on the dole.  There are, of course, many psychological reasons people are much better off at work than on the dole and I think most Deputies recognise this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only are we including in the Bill the incentive I have spoken about, but we are introducing a new incentive to take up work.  This should appeal to Deputies on the other side of the House as well as to my own backbenchers who <Col N="1140" /> mentioned it to me.  Deputies will be aware that there are many seasonal jobs or short term work opportunities available for three, six or nine months, particularly in the tourism, fishing and farming industries.  Many long term unemployed people may be reluctant to take up these jobs because they lose the extra benefits associated with their long term unemployed status if they work for more than 20 weeks.  I am removing this disincentive in the Bill.  Unemployed people can now take up these jobs for up to a year and return to their long term payment without any fuss or loss of extra benefits.  This is an important additional incentive and I hope it will be welcomed by the House.</P>
    <P>The social welfare package in this Bill will cost £164 million in a full year and £71 million this year.  The gross expenditure on social welfare is now over £3 billion a year.  Following this Bill after three years of consistent progress all long term social welfare payments will reach or exceed the commission's priority rate of £54.60 for 1991; in other words, the lowest long term rate is now £55 while others stand at over £60.  This year's 11 per cent increase for those on short term payments is a major step towards achieving the commission's priority rate for all social welfare recipients by 1993.</P>
    <P>The main improvements in rates are a 4 per cent general increase in all social welfare and health board payments; special increases of up to 11 per cent for those on the lowest payments; a significant improvement in child income support for families on social welfare and those at work on low pay; a new minimum child dependant allowance of £12 a week to those on social welfare; and the number of child dependant rates have been streamlined and reduced to three rates whereas four years ago &mdash; please note the significance of this &mdash; there were 36.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputies to recognise this progress because if they do not others will.  In addition, the higher <Col N="1141" /> rate of child benefit, £22.90, will be paid from the fourth child onwards.  Child dependant increases will be paid up to age 21 for school going children of long term recipients and the allowance will continue throughout the summer months where the child is not receiving that payment in his or her right.  I repeat this because no one seems to have noticed it to date: the allowance will continue throughout the summer months where the child is not receiving that payment in his or her own right; in other words it will not be stopped during the summer and restarted from September which has been the tradition.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement paid to people at work has been substantially improved.  A family with two children on £140 a week will get an extra £7 a week in addition to improvements under the child tax exemption limits.  School going children up to age 21 can now be included and the restriction on the amount of payment based on family size is gone.  This is a further new benefit.</P>
      <P>The maximum personal rate for the carer's allowance is being increased from £45 to £50.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A new minimum adult dependant payment of £33 a week is being introduced for all unemployment payments and disability benefit, an increase of 6.5 per cent, and widowed people and parents will continue to receive adult dependant or child dependant allowances for six weeks after the death of a spouse or child.  Again, I hope the House will warmly welcome this.  Spouses and parents go through a <Col N="1142" /> very difficult period at that time and this benefit will be of considerable help to them.</P>
    <P>We now have the lowest inflation rate in the EC,2.7 per cent.  Against his background, the general increase of 4 per cent provided for in this Bill will clearly keep those on social welfare ahead of inflation.  This increase alone costs £104 million in a full year and £45 million this year.  It more than meets the Government's commitment to the social partners to protect all payments against inflation.</P>
    <P>But we are doing more than this.  Again this year, we are giving special increases of up to 11 per cent to those on the lowest payments.  This is the fourth year in a row in which extra resources have been provided to raise the standards for the lowest paid.  The personal rate of supplementary welfare allowance and short term unemployment assistance will be increased by over 11 per cent from July. Families on these payments will receive increases of over 9 per cent.  As a result, some 100,000 people will benefit from these special increases.  Families of those on unemployment benefit and disability benefit are also getting special increases ranging up to 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let us see the effect of the increases during the past four years.  In 1986, the personal rate of long term unemployment assistance was £36.70 a week.  From next July, it will be £55, an increase of £18.30 or just under 50 per cent.  A married man with four children has received an increase of £38.85, or 40 per cent in the same period.  An old age pensioner couple received £91.50 in 1986.  They will now get £110, an increase of £8.50 or just over 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The following examples illustrate the increases we will pay from July next.  A couple with two children on long term-term unemployment assistance will receive £112 a week, an increase of £7, while a couple with 4 children will get an extra £9 bringing their payment to £136 a week.  A couple with four children on short term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance will receive £131.00, an increase of £11.00, <Col N="1143" /> and a couple with six children will get an extra £13.00, and a total payment of £155.00 each week.</P>
    <P>It is quite extraordinary to listen to people opposite telling the media that we are doing nothing for children or for families.  The facts show clearly that we have placed the weight of the money on families.  We have given the bulk of our support to families in hard cash terms. That is what our Social Welfare Bills have been about over the past three years. Large numbers of people benefit from the increases we are giving under this Bill.</P>
    <P>A lone parent under 66 with three children on an asistance payment will receive an additional £3.50, giving a total weekly payment of £97.  A widow or deserted wife on a contributory payment with four children will receive £120.60 which is an increase of £4.60.  An old age pensioner with an adult dependant on a non-contributory pension will get an extra £3, giving them a payment of £82.50 a week.  A couple both over 66 and under 80, on a contributory old age pension will get £110 a week.</P>
    <P>Some reference has been made to old age pension levels and the fact that they have been increased by the lower percentage. It is well ahead of inflation and our purpose is to bring everybody up to the commission's rates.  Everybody in this House declared this was what we were to do.  We have kept everybody ahead of inflation and given extra increases to old age pensioners, widows, deserted wives and others on assistance levels, since these were the lower rates.  Very special increases have been given to those on the lowest rates of unemployment allowance and supplementary welfare allowance. That is where the greatest special increases have been given.  The various bodies involved agreed this was the right way to go.</P>
    <P>We had to bring up the payments of those on the lowest levels.  That gives them more money in their pockets.  It may be said that if they had less money there would be more incentive to work. I make no apology for giving real <Col N="1144" /> increases to people on the lowest payments. It was right to do it and I stand by it.  If people at work are not being paid enough, that is another day's work.  We have boosted their position through the family income supplement scheme and the child related tax exemptions.  That has been most helpful.</P>
    <P>Three years ago, in 1988, we extended social insurance to the self-employed. This was an historic development in social security provision.  I recently signed regulations bringing almost 21,000 part-time workers into the protection of the social welfare system from 6 April next in line with a commitment given in the new programme.</P>
    <P>These workers will now have access to social welfare benefits and pensions.  For the first time they will be able to claim weekly payments from the Department of Social Welfare when they are unable to work because of illness, maternity or unemployment.  They will also be entitled to a pension on retirement.</P>
    <P>Part-time workers are the last remaining significant group to be brought into the protection of the social insurance system.  They are usually women working in traditionally low paid and often insecure employment.  I am very pleased to include these workers in the social welfare system in line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Many families who are living on low incomes rely heavily on the income from part-time work.  It is of vital importance therefore that these women have the security of the social welfare system to fall back on at times when they cannot work and in the longer term for their own pensions.  The regulations which I have made specified an earnings threshold of £40 per week for inclusion in the system. There has been some speculation that this threshold is open to manipulation by employers who want to evade their obligations to their employees.  The £40 threshold was set to strike a reasonable balance which would ensure that those who need them have reasonable access to benefits while at the same time minimising the cost for employers.  The <Col N="1145" /> weekly cost of full social insurance coverage to an employer at the threshold is £4.50 per employee per week.</P>
    <P>For that small sum an employee gets all cover.  Is there anyone who does not want to give that cover?  Are there employers who feel they cannot provide £4.50 per week for each worker in those circumstances?  If so, let them come forward. I want everybody to know them.  I assure the House that I will not hesitate to review the threshold if employers reduce hours or wages to exclude these vulnerable employees who are mainly women.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements for part-time workers are: social insurance cover is being provided for all private sector employees earning £40 or more a week; the condition under which employees are insurable if working for 18 hours or more has been abolished and the arrangement whereby employers had to establish whether or not an employee was mainly dependent on earnings from that employment has also been abolished; the overall PRSI structure is being simplified by the abolition of certain minor PRSI classes and this is an opportunity to standardise the classes; part-time workers will have access to the full range of social insurance payments &mdash; unemployment and sickness benefits will be payable on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis to insured people earning below £70 a week and other benefits such as old age and retirement pensions will be paid at the full rate; part-time workers will be required to pay the Class A contribution of 5.5 per cent, except where their income falls below £60 a week. Employers will contribute at a rate of 12.2 per cent in respect of each employee. They are also contributing 0.5 per cent, so, effectively, the rate is less than 12.2 per cent.  In certain sectors the majority of employees earn less than £60 per week and they will not have to pay the 5.5 per cent because of the exemption that applies.</P>
    <P>Sections 18, 19 and 20 enable me to make regulations to set out the details of social insurance entitlements for part-time workers.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to tell the House that <Col N="1146" /> we are solving once and for all, the problems of people with a mixed insurance record.  <i>Pro-rata</i> pensions for persons who failed to qualify for old age, contributory, and retirement pensions because of their mixed insurance records are provided for in sections 23 to 27.  This initiative will be of great benefit to some workers, such as employees in CIE who previously lost out on a social welfare pension when they retired.</P>
    <P>The rate of <i>pro-rata</i> pension payable to the people concerned will be in proportion to the period of insurance they have completed at class A.  These arrangements are similar to those which apply under EC regulations to persons with a mixture of insurance in a number of different EC member states.  I am sure a number of Deputies will welcome this because several Deputies have made the case for these workers over the years.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for improvements in the family income supplement.  Section 8 provides for the extension of the carer's allowance to carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance and carers of people getting a pension from an EC member state or from a country with whom Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.  This extension will take place from July.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputies have raised the case of people from other member states and they will be covered now by this improvement.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the introduction of a new minimum weekly payment of £5 for young people with an unemployment assistance entitlement whose only means are derived from board and lodgings in the family home.  Such a minimum payment has been sought by Deputies on both sides of the House for many years.</P>
    <P>Section 41 provides for the exemption of income arising from casual employment as a home help and from the Haemophilia HIV Trust Fund for the purposes of the means-tested social assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 to 5 provide for the increases from July next in the various payments. Section 6 provides for extending the age <Col N="1147" /> limits for payment of child dependant increases with certain long term social welfare payments from 20 to 21 years where the child is in full time education. This measure will take effect from September. This section also provides that family income supplement will continue to be paid where the child is between 18 and 21 years and is in full-time education.</P>
    <P>Section 7 increases the amount of family income below which FIS is payable and also provides for the abolition of the maximum payments which were related to family size.  The new arrangements will take effect from 25 July next.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the first time for the payment of an adult or child dependant allowance to be continued for six weeks after the death of a spouse or child. This recognises the burden which parents and widowed people have to endure following the sad loss of a child or spouse. It is intended to ease the adjustment in the early stages of bereavement.</P>
    <P>Section 10 makes provision for the abolition of the condition for entitlement to the full duration of 390 days of unemployment benefit at the maximum rate. Up to now a claimant must have had a yearly average of 40 PRSI contributions in the seven years preceding the claim. This year's increase in the rate of short term unemployment assistance has rendered this condition unnecessary.  We are going a bit further than that.  The section reduces the importance of that condition and we have agreement to remove it altogether. Section 11 provides for improvements in the means test for young people which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 to 15 relate to PRSI contributions generally.  The headlines in this morning's papers stress the increases in the ceiling for PRSI contributions.  I want to point out that this increase is the normal annual increase related to the movement of wages which keeps the social insurance fund functioning.  If this normal increase did not take place, the social insurance fund would gradually go out of existence.  The increase in the PRSI ceiling is the normal increase related to the movement in wages during the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> Sections 12 and 13 provides for the customary increase in the earnings ceilings up to which social insurance contributions are payable.  Again this year, I am glad to say that the rate of contribution is not being increased.  Section 12 provides for the increase in the ceiling for employers and employees.  The increase in respect of the self-employed is provided for in section 13.  Section 14 provides for a new minimum contribution for certain self-employed persons while section 15 provides for a new minimum contribution for voluntary self-employed contributors.  These changes will take effect from 6 April 1991.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for a new &ldquo;floor&rdquo; for pay related benefit purposes.  Section 17 provides for the easing of the contribution conditions for the receipt of unemployment and disability benefits. The current condition requires at least 48 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year to receive benefit at the maximum rate.  This is now being reduced to 39.  Please note that the contribution requirement is being reduced to 39.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 to 20 provide for the new conditions for receipt of disability benefit, unemployment benefit and invalidity pension for part-time workers.  I have already outlined the arrangements which will apply.  The PRSI contributions, which will be payable by part-time workers from 6 April 1991, will become effective for benefit entitlement in January 1993.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for the standardisation of maternity provisions from a date to be prescribed.  This will coincide with the introduction of legislation extending maternity leave under the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, to all women working more than eight hours rather than 18 as at present and will involve the discontinuance of the old maternity allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>Under legislation which has recently been introduced by the Minister for Labour, the number of hours required to be worked in a week in order to qualify for maternity leave under the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, is <Col N="1149" /> being reduced from 18 to eight.  This will mean that all women in employment except certain workers in short term contracts, will be covered by the maternity allowance scheme of women in employment. The necessary commencement order will coincide with the effective date of changes to the labour legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 22 removes the category of outworkers and manager of an employment office from the list of excepted employment for PRSI purposes.  They will in future be covered by full social insurance or self-employed contributions, as appropriate.  Sections 23 to 27 contain the necessary legislative changes to provide for the introduction of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for those people affected by the mixed insurance anomaly. Sections 28 to 38 provide for various technical provisions to tighten up in the area of control of fraud and abuse.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to the elimination of fraud and abuse in the social welfare system and to reducing the effect of the black economy.  A sum of £20 million of taxpayers money will be saved this year in a major new crackdown on PRSI related fraud.  The crackdown will involve overhauling the PRSI registration system; ensuring that employers comply with their PRSI obligations for their employees; and the recruitment of additional staff costing £1 million to investigate firms and detect defaulting employers.  Highly successful anti-fraud measures compelling employers in the construction, forestry, cleaning and security industries to notify my Department about new employees will now be extended to other sectors as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>Inspectors of my Department have carried out surveys on almost 2,400 firms to ensure that employers are complying with the new measures introduced in 1989.  So far these surveys have shown that almost 325 employers and 180 sub-contractors have failed to comply with the notification requirements.  In addition, there were 1,061 cases involving irregularities, such as employees working while they were receiving social welfare payments or employers paying <Col N="1150" /> the wrong rate of PRSI contribution.  The question of legal proceedings has arisen in the case of 100 employers and 500 employees.</P>
    <P>I have now increased the number of investigations.  At least 15,000 investigations a year will be carried out when all the new staff are in place.  The new arrangements will be widely publicised so that employers are well informed of their obligations.  My Department will take over from the Revenue Commissioners responsibility for allocating RSI numbers from 6 April next.  We are automatically giving an RSI number to everyone at age 16.  This will take the form of a plastic card with the bearer's signature.  It will lead to a more co-ordinated approach to the registration of new employees and better administration of people's benefits and entitlements which are based on the RSI number.</P>
    <P>Last week I announced an amnesty for employers as part of this PRSI-related fraud crackdown.  The amnesty will last for six months.  I will not take legal action against employers who do not meet their obligations under the PRSI system on condition that, they make arrangements to bring their PRSI payments up-to-date; they keep proper and accurate records in relation to the earnings of employees and the duration of their employment; and they co-operate fully with inspectors from my Department.  Any employers who do not get their affairs in order during this amnesty will be liable to prosecution. Unscrupulous employers and subcontractors who attempt to cheat the taxpayer, competitors, employees and their families will face stiff penalties.  I am also including employees in the new amnesty.  I will not take legal action against people who are fraudulently in receipt of any social welfare payment on condition that they report this to my Department and they make arrangements to repay the moneys received.</P>
    <P>Sections 39 and 40 provide for the abolition of separate employers occupational injuries and redundancy contributions from 6 April 1991.  This follows from the integration last year of the occupational injuries fund and the redundancy fund <Col N="1151" /> into the social insurance fund.  It does not, however, entail any increase in the overall employers PRSI contribution.</P>
    <P>Sections 41 to 59 provide for a range of miscellaneous provisions.  For example, section 41 provides for the exemption of income arising from casual employment as a home help and from the haemophilia HIV trust fund, for the purposes of the means-tested social assistance payments. Section 42 provides for the standardisation of &ldquo;waiting days&rdquo; as between disability benefit and occupational injuries benefit.  Section 43 gives statutory effect to the provisions regarding concurrent payments which are currently contained in regulations.  Section 44 brings the recoupment arrangements for supplementary welfare allowance into line with those for other payments.  This will simplify accounting arrangements.</P>
    <P>Sections 45 to 47 remove provisions in existing legislation in relation to the payment of supplementary welfare allowance, family income supplement and disabled persons's maintenance allowance. The new measures provide for a nondiscriminatory method of dealing with these payments.  They arise from a decision of the Supreme Court which held that certain provisions in social welfare legislation were unconstitutional in that they resulted in cohabiting couples being treated move favourably than married couples.  This will mean that the needs and means of a cohabiting couple will be aggregated in the same way as a married couple and that they will receive the same rate of payment as a married couple in similar circumstances.  They will now be able to benefit under the family income supplement scheme from which they were previously excluded.  Section 48 provides for a consequential new definition of a spouse.</P>
    <P>Section 49 provides that a claimant to unemployment benefit who has exhausted his 390 days entitlement cannot requalify until he has paid 13 contributions following the exhaustion of his entitlement.</P>
    <P>Sections 50 and 51 provide for modifications in the signing arrangements for payment of unemployment benefit and <Col N="1152" /> unemployment assistance and changes in the means calculation for unemployment assistance.  This will mean that present signing arrangements will be eased and the number of rates of unemployment assistance reduced in order to facilitate the introduction of alternative payment methods.  Section 52 provides for a change in the definition of continuous period of unemployment for unemployment assistance purposes.  It extends from 20 weeks to 52 weeks the period within which a previously unemployed person may resume signing without loss of their long term unemployed status and the extra benefits associated with that.</P>
    <P>Section 53 relates to the manner of notification of means for old age pensions purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 54 provides that, with the consent of the recipient, the Minister may withhold from any social welfare payment an amount to be agreed and the amount may then be paid to a body or organisation as designated by the recipient. This provision can be used, for example, to have a person's ESB bill or local authority rent paid directly by the Department to the relevant body.  These measures will be provided for in regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 55 provides for a technical improvement designed to reduce the administrative burden involved in deciding claims to disability benefit.  It will benefit claimants by reducing from six to three years the period over which a current claim may link with a previous claim.  Section 56 provides for an adjustment to the means assessment provisions for certain pensions so as to ensure that certain non-cash benefits and other income can be taken into account in the assessment.  The existing legislation is unclear on this issue hence the need for this new provision.  Sections 57 to 59 provide for technical matters such as the sanction of the Minister for Finance for the making of certain regulations and the repeal of obsolete provisions.</P>
    <P>Sections 60 to 64 provide for various technical amendments to the Pensions Act, 1990.  For example, section 60 gives powers to the Pensions Board to borrow <Col N="1153" /> money for the purposes of its expenditure. At present, the board's expenses are being funded through the Social Welfare Vote.  It is now proposed that the Pensions Board should operate their accounts and financial affairs independently of the Social Welfare Vote. Section 61 provides for a technical amendment to the Pensions Act relating to the preservation of benefit to a member of an occupational pension scheme.</P>
    <P>Sections 62 and 63 provide for the clarification of provisions in sections 55 and 56 of the Pensions Act relating to the requirement of trustees of pension schemes to provide annual reports.  Section 64 provides for the clarification of provision in the Third Schedule to the Pensions Act relating to funding standards of pensions schemes.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a very important piece of legislation.  It continues the progress we have made in the past four years in improving payments and modernising the social welfare system.  There are a few disadvantages here and there but when standardising the system must be evened out overall.  Broadly speaking, there are many extra benefits and advantages both in the technical measures and in the major amounts of money being allocated. Our overriding objective is to safeguard and improve the position of those dependent on social welfare.  I am satisfied that we are achieving that objective through progressively raising and improving the standard of living of people dependent on us and through introducing new provisions to meet the changing needs of society.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House today is seriously flawed and ignores the real problems of people who must depend entirely on social welfare. Despite what the Minister has said, it does nothing to come to grips with the proverty traps with which it would appear the system is absolutely riddled.  Above all, it does nothing to further the cause for the elderly.  Rather it is a collection <Col N="1154" /> of minor proposals which, when taken together, will have little effect.</P>
      <P>First, I want to bring the attention of the House to the overall economic position following on this year's budget, which is that the budget of the Department of Social Welfare appears to be in tatters.  In the recent <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> negotiated with the social partners, it was estimated that in this year there would be an average of 228,000 people out of work for which the Department of Social Welfare budgeted.  That programme was not 24 hours old when there was a huge increase in the numbers of unemployed, now standing at over 240,000.  All the indications are that this figure will continue to rise.  In view of that I want to know whether it will be necessary to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare. Obviously their budget is out of kilter already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer that immediately. As the Deputy said, the 228,000 is an average.  Normally it reflects high levels at this stage and lower levels later; it depends on what happens later in the year.</P>

    <P>The Social Welfare Bill begins its Second Reading in the House today under the cloud of the decision of the European Court which nobody will deny was a great victory for the two women concerned.  The background to the case is on record.  I do not have to repeat it. Nonetheless I want to place on record that I consider it most important that there be equality of opportunity in respect of benefits and opportunity in <Col N="1155" /> respect of all sections of the community. The decision in that case raises huge question marks for the Government.  I should like to know whether the Government feel bound by that decision.  The Minister must also inform the House from where the money is likely to emanate if he is bound by that decision; he must inform the House what will be the overall figures involved.  According to the press it would cost £200 million, in which case a supplementary budget will have to be introduced.</P>

      <P>I sincerely hope that the decision in the case to which I was referring will establish once and for all that all types of inequality in Irish society &mdash; but particularly those relating to women &mdash; must be abolished once and for all.  I think everybody would agree with that.  In passing I should like to compliment the Free Legal Aid Centre on the manner in which they highlighted this matter, an aspect of Irish life which has been brought to the European Court and which has very serious consequences for the finances of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>A most controversial aspect of the Bill before the House today centres on the decision to change the interpretation of the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;.  I do not disagree with the Minister in this respect because I understand the problems that had obtained.  The new definition is to the effect that men and women who are not married to each other but who are cohabiting will be treated as man and wife.  I understand the reasoning behind that changed definition because to date, in certain circumstances, people who had been cohabiting were claiming single benefits which had the effect of their aggregated incomes, as single people, being higher than those of married couples. Few people will disagree with that.  Nonetheless there could be downstream, significant aspects of this about which the Minister may not have thought.  I am not a lawyer but I should like the Minister, for example, to address the question of inheritance rights.  If this type of semilegal status is afforded people who are unmarried &mdash; who are now regarded, at least in social welfare terms, as being married &mdash; then I should like to ascertain what are the inheritance rights as between both partners and the partners and their offspring.  Perhaps this is a matter for the Attorney General.  It would be my hope that there would not arise another precedent leading to another trip to the European Court which could have enormous significance in future years.  I put it on record because it is worthy of mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> The Bill before us does nothing to instil confidence among people now in receipt of social welfare benefits but who are most anxious to gain admittance to or participate in social employment schemes.  This is where I disagree totally with the Minister's opening remarks.  I must admit to being an advocate of the concept of the social employment schemes for the unemployed.  I contend they are a great idea and have brought great personal satisfaction to many people.  The challenge of having to work for the money is something many are only too willing to do if given the chance.  This Government, in one of the greatest policy U-turns, not widely known, actually raided the Department of Labour Estimates immediately before budget day and subtracted £3 million from that subhead. That is a fact.  Naturally this will have the effect of there being fewer places available on those schemes this year, now acknowledged by the Department. Because of that direct Government policy there will be fewer people participating in social employment schemes this year than there were last year and, by definition, more drawing social welfare benefits.  I consider that to be a mortal sin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Contrary to what the Minister said, the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare have not been implemented.  It would appear that the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare in regard to the many short term unemployed will not be implemented even within the next five years.</P>
      <P>There are the pious platitudes expressed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> such as those contained in paragraph II of Section IV which I quote:</P>
      <P>The Government now commit themselves under this Programme to the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  to continue to protect social welfare rates against inflation,</P>
      <P>(b)  to move by 1993 to the priority level of rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare involving an estimated additional full year expenditure of £65 million (on the assumption of an annual 3 per cent inflation rate) and</P>
      <P>(c)  thereafter, to increase social welfare rates further and progressively, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, as the resources of the economy grow.</P>
      <P>Those last words are the most important in that quotation.  It is true that the poor must always wait, and they will certainly wait in those circumstances, too.  This means that if the Government continue to fund social welfare for those categories at the same rate as at present, those pious platitudes contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will be as far away as ever in five years time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> At this stage I would like to make a point so far as my attitude to social welfare generally is concerned.  I want to create jobs; I believe most Deputies want jobs created.  It is very important that 95 per cent of people want to be usefully employed in sustainable jobs.  The massive publicity surrounding the proverty trap, which is so glaringly obvious in our taxation laws, comes as no surprise to me, and should not come as a surprise to anybody who takes a close look at how taxation is devised here.  We need a new imaginative approach to ensure that people who are able and who want to go to work five mornings a week are better off working than they are on the dole, and that is how people perceive it.  The perception people have is most important. Irrespective of what the Minister said about Deputy Bruton, Deputy Mitchell, myself or anybody else, there is a perception in every corner of Ireland that people in receipt of unemployment benefit are better off than if they were working.  I want to qualify that.</P>
    <P>I know more people who are poor than who are rich.  I do not know whether that is good for me personally.  I have never yet seen anybody living in the lap of luxury who was in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  It is not so much the financial rewards that are important but the incentives to create the jobs.  That is something this Government obviously have not done because for a variety of reasons, our unemployment figures are rising very steeply.  This is a matter of grave concern. It affects the national work ethic because there is nothing more soul destroying than an unhappy workforce or a workforce that, on the toss of a coin, could decide to stay at home or go to work. We are too near that line at present.  I sincerely hope the Minister and his colleagues in Government will devise methods to ensure that the choice is much less clearcut.</P>
    <P>Our taxation laws are a laugh and irrespective of what the Minister for Finance says over the past number of years there has been no new imaginative thinking so <Col N="1160" /> far as the elimination of the poverty traps are concerned.  It is imperative that jobs are created to try to break the vicious cycle of long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>The social employment schemes are, by no stretch of the imagination secure employment nor were they ever intended to be.  They were basically training models where people's skills could be developed over a period, thereby enabling them to rejoin the workforce in another capacity.  However, in the interim, there is no doubt that the social employment scheme on a week-on week-off basis, as currently organised in both town and country, is far preferable than paying people on the dole.  Many people who were on these schemes have confided to me that it will be breaking their hearts when their 12 month stint is over and they have to go back on the dole.  Many of them take great pride in the community projects in which they are involved.  It is a crying shame and an indictment of this Government that their talents are not being used for the good of the community.</P>
    <P>Today I am speaking a great deal about discrimination.  I believe this Bill is guilty on another count.  There is no real commitment to help people who are charged with the responsibility of looking after the elderly.  I refer, of course, to the so-called carer's allowance.  I should like to put it on record that there are few schemes in the social welfare code that have the same potential to do good as the carer's allowance scheme.  However, it is almost fraudulent the way the Minister announced the benefits of this carer's allowance to the public over the last six or eight months.  Expectations were built up to a level and people were bitterly disappointed when the facts were pointed out to them.  As I have already said there are few schems that have such potential to help the elderly.  It is an undeniable fact that the vast majority of elderly people would prefer to live their lives in the security of their own home, but this can cause a certain amount of inconvenience as every family who has gone through the trauma of looking after their elderly relatives is aware.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> Irish life is peppered with examples of what I can only describe as dedication beyond the call of duty, in many cases by people who are no blood relation of the elderly being looked after.  How many thousands of elderly invalids are being cared for this very day by their daughter-in-law, a person who is no blood relation? Let us look for a moment at what we are speaking about.  We are speaking about care: care for every one of the 24 hours in a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, and in many cases for several years. How many people have given up their jobs to look after their aging parents? How many families have reorganised their lifestyle?  From a family point of view that is no credit to these sons and daughters who show their love and affection for their aging parents by willingly accepting this responsibility.  If they do not do that, what would be the alternative?</P>
    <P>There is a great need for both public and private geriatric homes.  There is no problem for people who have been in professional or self employment over the years and who managed to organise a retirement fund and genuinely would like the benefit of living in a retirement home or complex, but it is important that society would see that those facilities are made available.  This is to be highly recommended if people want that level of service and are prepared to pay for it. There is a problem, and this is where my interest lies: my thoughts this morning are for the people who have nothing but the old age non-contributory pension of £52 to £55 per week, and whose families are not much better off.  If the thousands of people of whom I speak shirked their responsibilities, there would be unbearable pressure on the various health boards and geriatric services to the point where they could not cope.  Indeed, they can barely cope at present.</P>
    <P>In effect, a family who look after their elderly are worth almost £300 a week to the Exchequer because that is the cost of a bed in a nursing home.  Is it not time the Minister and the Government woke up to this fact, or do we want to kill the goose that laid the golden egg?  It is surprising the independence a small <Col N="1162" /> weekly payment would give those carers. This vital area has sadly been neglected by the Government.  Having heard what the Minister had to say about the carer's allowance, unfortunately, I do not think there is any great hope for the future.  I am not advocating blanket coverage of all carers as I know the Exchequer could not afford this at present.  The Exchequer would not be in a position to write such a cheque for everybody.  However, I should like ordinary people on low incomes to be entitled to receive a carer's allowance in addition to the social welfare payments they receive at present.  What we now have is direct substitution; there may be some small extra payment in certain conditions but there is no real difference between the old prescribed relative's allowance the new carer's allowance.  When the carer's allowance was introduced everyone thought it was a great idea but it has been a big let down.</P>

      <P>If a family has an income of more than £90 per week they will be debarred from receiving the carer's allowance.  That is a fact and I have several submissions on my desk at present to prove this.  I defy contradiction on this point.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to several examples on Committee Stage.  I want to refer to a serious omission from this year's Social Welfare Bill.  I cannot understand why adoptive parents are not entitled to receive a maternity grant when they get custody of their child.  Why was this not provided for years ago?  After all adoptive mothers have as much trouble with their babies as natural mothers have. They face the same costs, sleepless nights, disruption of family life and pressures.  For the life of me I cannot understand why these parents are discriminated against.  Even though there is no reference to this in the Bill I ask the Minister to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage which will allow payment to be made to adoptive parents. From a financial point of view, this would not cost much because numerically speaking the number of cases will be very small.  The extension of this payment to adoptive parents would be a great gesture on the part of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to another serious omission from the Bill, the treatment currently being meted out to participants on the social employment scheme.  As the <Col N="1164" /> House is aware, the Government introduced legislation two or three years ago which made it obligatory for the self-employed, the majority of whom are farmers, to be included in the PRSI scheme.  It was decided that there should be a minimum contribution period of ten years.  Therefore, the self-employed, irrespective of who they are, must be 56 years of age or under on entry into the scheme before they are entitled to receive an old age contributory pension when they reach 66 years.  However, as is the case in all new schemes, problems have arisen in regard to this scheme.</P>
    <P>It is now estimated that approximately 14,000 farmers, through no fault of their own, will be debarred from the scheme even though they will have paid their contributions up to the age of 66 years. Farmers who were 58, 59, 60 and 61 years when they commenced paying their contributions, unfortunately, will not receive a pension when they reach 66 years as they will not have ten years' contribution stamps.  This is highly unjust.  The scheme was ill-conceived in so far as it did not foresee this problem. The Minister must show some compassion and commitment to this vital section of the self-employed.  Not only does this affect farmers, it also affects many other self-employed people.</P>
    <P>I do not want these people to be given any preferential treatment.  As I have said before in this House, contributors should be allowed to continue their payments for a full ten year period at which stage the old age contributory pension should be paid to them.  This would mean that some self-employed people, including farmers, would not be eligible to receive a pension until they are 68 or 70 years of age.  From a financial point of view another benefit of this would be that this category of people would be expected to draw on the Exchequer to a lesser degree than anyone who was included in the scheme three, four or five years before them.  The present system discriminates against a certain sector of the community. This problem should be addressed and I will put down an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with it and I sincerely <Col N="1165" /> hope the Minister will be able to accept it.</P>
    <P>The Government are unsympathetic to the self-employed.  I thoroughly agree with the concept of the family income supplement scheme.  However, this aid which could help overcome the poverty trap has not been used to the full extent by the Minister to make it more attractive for people to work than stay on the dole. Sufficient use has not been made of this vital mechanism.  The scheme is clearly cost-effective in that it is possible to target precisely the people who should receive this benefit.  There will be no major change in the scheme despite the fact that there has been a small relaxation in the eligibility rules.  However, self-employed people, be they shopkeepers, carpenters or farmers, who fall on hard times have to work under very difficult conditions.  I see no reason why the family income supplement scheme should not be extended under certain conditions to this category of people.  I accept that safeguards will have to be built into the scheme but, provided their income is verified by the Revenue Commissioners, there is no valid reason why such people should not be entitled to receive family income supplement.  A small bit of imagination, together with the necessary commitment, would alleviate the grave problems experienced by the self-employed.</P>
    <P>It is also very important that the family income scheme is extended to FÁS workers on social employment schemes. I was shocked to learn that cumulative earnings of a poorly paid job plus a family income supplement would be greater than the pay a FÁS worker receives under the social employment scheme. Obviously, this anomaly should be rectified immediately.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a very important section of the community who have genuine cause for concern, small farmers on farmer's dole.  I understand that approximately 14,000 farmers are in receipt of unemployment assistance or, as we call it, the small farmer's dole.  As the Minister, and his Department, are aware, every day of the week applications <Col N="1166" /> for assistance are made by farmers who have never had anything to do with social welfare.  I am not happy with the method of assessment of the means of small farmers.  There is not a consistent assessment procedure.  In other words, there is no consistent method of calculating a farmer's means and the amount of his disposable income.  I hear of cases every day of the week, not alone in the west but all over Ireland, of small farmers who should come under this category but for some reason they are deemed ineligible for farmer's dole.  In fairness to the Minister the scheme has been streamlined to a certain degree in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is a mentality among some social welfare officers that because a person has a certain number of animals irrespective of their value, be they sheep or cattle, he has to be reasonably well off.  Two technical matters have to be addressed. Because a farmer may look reasonably well off, has a reasonably kept house and farm and has an above average number of stock on the farm it should not be taken that this farming family are well off financially.  In some cases when social welfare officers arrive at a farmer's gate they have already decided whether the farmer will receive dole, and that is not reasonable.</P>
    <P>Many farmers find it difficult to produce receipts and that is a negative factor as far as they are concerned.  I want to make it clear that several thousand farmers who have applied or are about to apply for farmer's dole will not receive it, not because they are outside the ambit of the scheme but because of this preconceived notion that they are big farmers if they have a certain number of livestock.  This matter will raise its head right across rural Ireland in 1991 &mdash; I will not dwell on that today because it is not relevant to the Bill &mdash; due to the implications of the GATT negotiations and the Common Agricultural Policy reform programme.  Thousands of extra farmers will apply for dole before this year is out.</P>
    <P>There appears to be what I would regard as a degree of averaging as regards the number and the value of stock a <Col N="1167" /> farmer has for sale.  Heretofore, the Department of Social Welfare believed the price of cattle was below average and they gave the balance of the doubt to the claimant, but the Department now believe that farmers are getting more for cattle and sheep than is the case.  I ask the Minister to consider that matter closely.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister how he intends to distribute the £1 million announced in the budget for smallholders. I assume the Department of Agriculture and Food are working in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare in this regard.  I hope this money will be distributed as soon as possible. It is, of course, a pittance, but everybody wants to know how it will be distributed and to whom.</P>
    <P>There is quite a delay between the time an applicant applies for farmer's dole and when the actual decision is made.  That is the case not alone with farmer's dole but with many other forms of benefit.  In some cases claimants have to wait five to seven months before a decision is made. Surely in this age of technology there is no reason for that.  I have been led to believe that the community welfare officers of the health boards are about to come under the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare.  If this is the case the Minister should consider transferring some of the workload in this area to them.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one matter which regrettably is not mentioned in the Bill. I understood the Bill would include procedures to be adopted in the implementation of the integrated approach to the unemployed in black spot areas.  This was mentioned in the budget and I am very curious to know what the proposals are or how this integration will take place. When will the House get a chance to have a debate on the areas that will be highlighted?  How will they be identified? What will be the criteria and, more importantly, who will the major players be?  What input will the unemployed people have?  Will the scheme be connected with local schools, employment offices and Manpower agencies?  The <Col N="1168" /> questions are endless.  There is a good future for the scheme if it is handled properly.  It should not be just another talking shop.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to section 41 which deals with assistance schemes and means test exemptions.  I compliment the Minister on his proposal to disregard &ldquo;any income arising from employment of a casual nature by a health board as a home help&rdquo;. That is a very important aspect in the sense that many people who would be only too willing to give a few hours of their time to helping people locally and get a few pounds for doing so, heretofore would have had to pay tax on that income and did not think it was worth their while. This exemption is to be highly recommended.</P>
    <P>In general I agree with the measures to combat abuse.  The section dealing with failure to keep records places a grave responsibility on employers to ensure that they return all documents relevant to their employees.</P>
    <P>There are two or three other aspects of this Bill I would like to mention in passing.  The Minister said that nobody referred to the fact that we have a good social welfare system for the elderly, particularly for old age pensioners.  I have no doubt that some countries pay less to the elderly by way of old age pensions than we do.  It could be said that people here receive a reasonable old age pension, but there is one sad factor missing in this regard.  There is an attack at present by other agencies of Government on recipients of old age pensions.  For instance, Telecom Éireann have proposed to meter local telephone calls.  It takes elderly people a lot longer to convey a message on a telephone than is the case with a younger person.  If the calls are metered at three or five minutes obviously this will cause huge problems for the elderly.  Only two days ago I met a man of 80 years of age in a provincial town who said his life changed dramatically for the better six months ago when he got a telephone.  He feels more secure and has greater communication with the outside world.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware there is a free <Col N="1169" /> telephone rental scheme, but people have to pay for calls.  If Telecom Eireann go through with this proposal the Minister will have to seriously consider paying for phone calls up to a certain level, as is the case with electricity.  There is no doubt that communication for the elderly is vital.  No other section of the community depend so much on other people.  The free travel scheme is excellent.  It gives elderly people the opportunity of travelling all over Ireland and they are able to develop new interests after retirement. As the years go by and they are no longer able to avail of free transport, that is when the telephone will be very important.</P>
    <P>There is also an attack on security arrangements, particularly in rural Ireland.  I know a woman who lives not 20 miles from this city who prays every night for daybreak, in case someone would break in and rob her during the night.</P>
    <P>Many facilities are being phased out; the decision to close rural post offices will make life extremely difficult for old age pensioners.  It is horrifying to think of an elderly couple having to hire a car to go eight or nine miles to collect their pensions.  Of course, for political reasons, it will not happen until after 27 June but many small rural post offices will be closed before the end of the year or early in 1992.</P>
    <P>It is very important to treat everybody &mdash; particularly the unemployed &mdash; with great dignity.  In several existing employment exchanges which lack facilities people are treated as numbers, not as human beings.  They must go up to a counter with maybe 30 people standing behind them and give all their personal details.  Nobody should be subjected to that sort of treatment and, while I know that interview rooms are included in new buildings, surely something could be done in this regard in the old buildings? People have to tell the most intimate details of their financial position and everybody in the room can hear them. People in receipt of unemployment benefit should not be subjected to that kind of treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> Unfortunately, the Social Welfare Bill is just a lot of hot air and does not further the elimination of the poverty trap; it does nothing to get people back to work. By the time many social welfare recipients receive the extra £3 or £4 they will be no better off on 1 August 1991 than they were on 1 August 1990.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>When you consider that the Department of Social Welfare were set up in 1947 with the objective of bringing under one roof the insurance and welfare schemes which operated at the time&mdash;and we see the complex legislation before us today &mdash; you wonder whether the time has come for a review of the whole operation of social welfare because it has come to mean payment. There has been very little innovation in that area and the enormous problem of 250,000 people unemployed must be addressed with imagination and innovation. The elements for tackling the problem are contained in a number of Departments and there is a need for coordination in developing the types of policies needed.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill, which gives effect to the provisions of the budget, contains little or nothing constructive or innovative to deal with the continuing crisis of poverty.  The Labour Party believe that the social welfare provisions of the budget represent a failed opportunity and are totally inadequate in the context of assisting thousands of people already living on an inadequate income. Over the last four years the Government reduced Exchequer spending on social welfare by over 15 per cent in real terms. Indeed, in 1990, the gross current income&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that over 30 per cent of households live below the poverty line; all social welfare payments are below those recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in relation to minimum levels of income; 30 per cent of all employees receive a gross weekly wage of less than £130 per week and nearly 45,000 children live in households which are below the poverty line.  This is the grim record of Fianna Fáil in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  Social welfare increases are poor, they are at the level of 4 per cent when inflation is forecast at 3 per cent.  There has already been a rent increase for the very people about whom we are talking, the increased payments will not be made until the middle of the year and there will be VAT increases on ESB and telephone bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton dealt at some length with peripheral increases in costs which will affect social welfare recipients. One which can easily be forgotten is the cost of cable television which increased this year in terms of royalties to performers, and VAT is also applied to that increase.  The small comforts which <Col N="1172" /> people have are becoming more expensive and, in real terms, the increases are small in bringing any improvement to those people.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not have a great record in relation to child benefit.  In every year &mdash; except one &mdash; it has been frozen.  This year the increase relates to the fourth child which means that, if there are four children in the family, there is an increase of 40p per child.  In a family of six children, the increase amounts to 27p per child.  The Government have done nothing for mothers and children in this context and these changes will do very little to end the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>The Minister's sleight of hand was alluded to earlier in terms of cohabiting couples and the result of Supreme Court Hyland case in 1988.  The Minister's answer is not in the spirit of the finding of the Supreme Court.  Married people in this context and, indeed, people who were cohabiting were treated shabbily. We will be opposing that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister's colleague brought the part-time workers' Bill before the Dáil and it is now going on to the Seanad.  The Labour Party welcome this legislation, although we have problems with it.  We welcome also the consequent extension of the social welfare schemes to part-time workers but, as I said here last week, to the Minister for Labour, in order that this scheme works properly and people get the full and proper benefit from the social welfare provisions, there is an absolute need to introduce a minimum wage.  In the debate last week a number of Government backbenchers spoke strongly on that matter.  The Labour Party have advocated a minimum wage of £3.50 per hour.  It is very important for part-time workers that it is an hourly wage rather than a weekly wage.  A great number of people are involved in part-time work.  The 1987 labour force survey revealed that there were 65,000 regular part-time workers in this country of whom 72 per cent were female, 70 per cent of those being married.</P>
    <P>This brings us to another problem in our welfare system relating to the income <Col N="1173" /> limit for spouses in terms of their being considered a dependants spouse and also to child benefit being paid at the full rate. If a spouse &mdash; usually a wife &mdash; earns more than £55 per week in part-time employment, her husband is not paid for his wife as a dependant and in respect of child benefit is paid at only half the full rate.  If this Government are serious about the part-time workers' Bill and about extending social welfare entitlements to this group, this income limit must be increased dramatically.</P>
    <P>Poverty has to be considered in a very particular context.  The Presidential election and the campaign leading up to it has a bearing here.  Mary Robinson's nomination for the Presidency came from the Labour Party but I am not claiming her election was in any way an indication of a major move to the Left in Irish politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I might advise the Deputy that ordinarily we are very careful that we do not introduce the President into any of our deliberations here, so I ask the Deputy to treat whatever point he is making having due regard for the Office of the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for your guidance and I wish to refer to the period before the President was elected.  I think that is legitimate and I will be making no comment about the President in any sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to be mindful of the desirability that we do not involve our esteemed President in any of our deliberations here.  Maybe with the capacity he has for words, the Deputy can make his case without referring to the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be guided by you, Sir, and I will follow your advice.  In a certain election in this country before Christmas the fact that the successful candidate represented something new is something the whole political establishment needs to take cognisance of.  I <Col N="1174" /> believe a desire for change, a protest against the underlying <i>status quo</i> was demonstrated.  More importantly, many people out there who live lives pervaded by hopelessness found during that time a reason for reaching out of that despair, maybe for a brief moment realising there are better ways and wanting to take charge of their own lives.  In this country we have in real terms over a quarter of a million people unemployed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reduction in the age, from 60 to 58, in respect of the special pre-retirement allowance for long term unemployed.  It must be pointed out, though, that the group of about 7,000 who last year availed of that provision were not included on the live register. Therefore, that age limit reduction will, if I am correct, have the effect of artificially reducing the live register once again.  An ESRI survey published in January demonstrated that 100,000 of the quarter of a million at present unemployed have been unemployed for more than 12 months and people who are unemployed are five times more likely to suffer from stress than the rest of the population. According to that report, people in employment or on training schemes are five times less likely to be stressed than if they are unemployed.  We need to bear that in mind because the bottom line with people in the poverty trap is dignity.  I am sure the Minister finds from his work in his constituency that in the initial stages of unemployment people take up hobbies or go for long walks but gradually abandon those pastimes, stay at home and become less involved with the community. There we see the whole grinding process of the reduction of self image.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party in their pre-budget submission asked the Government to extend the employment incentive scheme so that employers would be paid increased subsidies when they took on people who were long term unemployed. I put it to the Minister that he and the Government have a duty to address themselves to the special problems of that group.  We are bitterly disappointed that the Minister let this chance go by without making any gesture which would make it <Col N="1175" /> more attractive for employers to take on long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has introduced a new incentive to take up work for the seasonally employed be it in fishing, tourism or whatever, but in the overall context I put it to the Minister that it is minimal and in no way discriminates in terms of those who are long term unemployed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The other incentive schemes are under the Department of Labour so they cannot come under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking that the Government address that problem and it brings us back to the point I made earlier, that the fact that the schemes and various backup services are spread over a number of Departments causes much unnecessary duplication and causes a situation in which the taxpayer in the first instance is not getting value for the services provided. Most importantly, the recipients are not getting the full and efficient benefit they could get from a streamlined service.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton spoke in terms of extending the family income supplement to those who are taking part in social employment schemes.  I have had quite a number of representations on this issue over the past year.  People on these schemes no longer get free fuel, the Christmas bonus or free beef.  I had a letter from a woman whose husband was on a social employment scheme.  They had five children and their local authority rent had increased from £8 to £16.  It is one of those quirks of the system where there are income limits and fractions involved in the rent scheme.  In general, the social employment scheme is fraught with injustice and problems that need to be addressed by the Minister and his colleague in the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that people can avail of training schemes in the context of what I said earlier, that people who are working on training schemes are five times less likely to suffer from stress. <Col N="1176" /> That argument alone would justify these schemes, but the schemes are causing bitterness and frustration among the people working on them.  These problems need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the minimal move of allowing £5 income to 18 years olds and older people living at home.  However, there is a fundamental question of civil rights which must be addressed.  An 18 year old can join the Defence Forces and be killed in the service of country.  An 18 year old can marry, buy a house and, in the context of the recent debate generated by Fianna Fáil, legally acquire condoms. However an 18 year old living at home whose parents have a reasonable income is treated as a non-person without any income in terms of the means test carried out on board and lodgings.  The £5 is welcome but it is minimal and raises the question of how unemployed people can retain their pride and dignity.  I know young people whose confidence is being undermined because they must spend their lives with their hand out by reason of their parents having a reasonable income thus providing the State with an excuse for not giving them anything.  Much more is required in this area.</P>
    <P>I will not criticise the small issues that have been dealt with in the budget.  I had occasion in the other House to welcome innovations introduced by the Minister. I would ask the Minister to address himself to the three waiting days for unemployment benefit.  I had a case recently of a person who had been on unemployment benefit and then got three weeks work at Christmas.  When this person returned to unemployment benefit, three waiting days were required and those three days were lost.  When somebody gets work for such a short period the three waiting days should not apply; indeed it should not apply in any situation.</P>
    <P>A problem in rural Ireland which has been there for many years and which has worsened somewhat recently, depending on what part of the country a person lives in, relates to telephoning social welfare departments in Dublin, Sligo or Letterkenny. People in the capital have always had the facility to contact the <Col N="1177" /> Department on a local call and the Department have arranged that calls can be relayed from Dublin to Sligo, but I am not sure if that facility has been provided yet for calls to Letterkenny.  This is a perk for the people living in the capital.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Department of Social Welfare be made a lot more proximate to people.  People spend a lot of money on calls to social welfare offices, because they are paying the full rate at peak time.  The day has long since gone when this anomaly should have been rectified. This deep injustice should be rectified. Technology has greatly improved in this area.  It is a question of whether the Minister is prepared to pay to give a service to the rest of Ireland that his constituents in Dublin and people in the urban areas generally have.  Problems arising in relation to social welfare can be difficult to resolve and people may have to make long telephone calls to resolve them.  With all the services being lost to people in rural Ireland, the Minister should urgently attack this problem.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to address another problem which does not affect many people, but which affects a number of my constituents.  Because of materials used in a particular employment someone may develop skin ailments.  Dermatitis is one that comes to mind.  A person so affected cannot continue in that employment and must go out on disability benefit, but immediately he is removed from the source of the irritation he is restored to full health and when he goes before a medical referee he is found capable of work.  In some cases the company doctor or the person's doctor will not allow the person back to work.  In my experience companies make every effort to find alternative employment within the company for such people, removing them from the offending agent, but the problem arises when short-time working is introduced.  Because of the period during which the person was found capable of work, but would not be allowed to return to work by the medical officer of the company or by his own doctor, he has no credited contributions for that period and cannot qualify for unemployment benefit <Col N="1178" /> when short-time working is introduced. This problem affects a small number of workers but I would ask the Minister to address the problem.  Perhaps it could be rectified by way of regulation rather than legislation.  It is an injustice to a small group and the Minister immediately should do what he can to resolve it.</P>
    <P>A growing problem relates to mortgages. Last year we were told that in the UK one in five mortgages were in bad trouble.  In my area I see a problem with mortgages particularly when people go on social welfare payments or on short-time work.  The higher the income tax rate a person pays, the more tax relief he gets on his mortgage.  A person working and paying a mortgage gets relief from the State, but when he becomes unemployed or goes on short-time working, there is no relief from the State.  The health boards can make money available by way of a subsidy for a mortgage, but this is confined to people on social welfare.</P>
    <P>This Government, like their predecessors, have an appalling record on housing.  The much vaunted social housing programme was launched last week and the aspiration is to have 1,500 new starts this year but this compares very badly with the number of houses built, 5,000 to 6,000, by Labour Ministers in the mid-eighties.  Therefore, the position is not getting any better.  As a result, a problem which I have come across in my own area, and I am sure this is true in many other areas also, the price of private accommodation is increasing because of the increasing demand.  In the absence of any State help to get them over temporary difficulties, some people have had their houses repossessed as they could not meet their repayments.  I am talking here about people on short-time work who may lose their houses and become a liability, in terms of the state having to provide them with local authority housing, whereas a small investment at the right time to see them through their difficulties could relieve the problem.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance was introduced last year with a fanfare but it has turned <Col N="1179" /> out be a damp squib.  However I welcome the improvements made.  I wish to instance the case, in my own area, of a husband and wife where he was confined to bed and was in receipt of invalidity pension with her as a dependant, while she was in receipt of a supplementary welfare allowance at the rate of £5 per week from the health board.  She applied for and was granted the carer's allowance but, in real terms, this represented an increase of only £5 per week as her husband could no longer claim for her as a dependant.  As well as this she lost the extra £5 that she had been getting from the health board each week with the result that, because there are children involved, she has ended up with four social welfare books and the same payment. I have also come across cases of women looking after both parents, who would otherwise need to be hospitalised, and in receipt of no help because of a very low income threshold.  Sufficient imagination was not shown in designing the scheme and the scope of caring has not been sufficiently examined under the scheme &mdash; the Minister may grin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight million pounds has been made available for those on the lowest incomes and this represents a good start.  We will build on this figure as we go on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would need to build on this figure much quicker because many people, who are making great sacrifices in looking after relatives or, indeed, as Deputy Connaughton pointed out, someone who is not a blood relative in the good old Irish tradition of neighbourliness and decency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but the point I am making is that the income limits are too low and this is of no help to those who have been providing a great social service for many years at no cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> I regularly receive complaints about medical referees who assess people for disability benefit.  Generally women tend to feel more aggrieved than men.  The pattern seems to be that people are called in every so often and found to be capable of work to see if they will appeal, following which the payment is restored. Therefore there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction with the medical referee system.</P>
    <P>In relation to part-time work, I ask the Minister to address two specific problems in the area of social welfare.  In certain types of employment, a person works for two or three days a week, starts at 11 p.m. and works until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. While this is only a three or four hour stint, it is considered employment on two separate days for social welfare purposes. Therefore people in this category may be precluded from signing on three days a week while others who work a greater number of hours can do so.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that people who work for one hour a day do not qualify for unemployment assistance as they are not available for work during the day.  I am also disappointed that no provision has been made for 16 to 18 year olds living at home and not in full-time education.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the question of regionalisation and decentralisation of the Department.  I believe that too many of our administrative structures are based in Dublin and that a sufficient slice of the national cake has not been given to areas throughout the country.  I would like the Minister to expand on his proposals for regionalisation and decentralisation.</P>
    <P>My main criticism of the Bill is that it does not reach out to people or send them any message of hope.  It only deals with payments.  As I said in my opening remarks, many of our social problems have to be tackled on a co-ordinated basis.  On a number of occasions I have raised the question of discipline in our schools with the Minister for Education. This problem occurs particularly in urban areas.  No sanctions are applied nowadays and the question of whether this is a good thing is a matter for another day.  We are <Col N="1181" /> all glad that corporal punishment is gone but nonetheless sanctions are important.</P>
    <P>Family problems cannot be solved in the context of the school alone.  I have put it to the Minister for Education that in each VEC area there should be a school welfare officer who would have the responsibility of co-ordinating the work of the various agencies, be they statutory or voluntary, who offer support to families. One of the problems that I see is that there are many agencies but there is no one there to pull them all together.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal under section 54 that deductions be made from social welfare payments and passed on to the ESB or local authority to cover bills.  People in receipt of social welfare benefits find it extremely difficult to put together monthly instalments for things like mortgage payments.  Now they can deal with it on a weekly budgetary basis. This innovation will be very useful.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about families which have all sorts of financial and health problems, but especially the families where the parents see no joy or hope.  They are robbed of the joy of seeing their children aspire to a life better than their own.  That is what the poverty trap is about.  Those who are educated are much more likely to find employment.  The number of manual jobs is retracting.  Unless the problem of poverty and unemployment is tackled we will not make progress.</P>
    <P>I will not be ungracious about the improvements the Minister is introducing and I welcome the technical amendments to the social welfare code, but our major concern is that the Minister is failing to introduce the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  We live in a society where 250,000 people are unemployed, 100,000 of whom have been out of work for more than 12 months. Almost 8,000 people between the ages of 60 and 65 are on pre-retirement courses. The reduction of the age limit for these courses from 60 to 58 is a tacit admission by the Government that older people in society who have lost their jobs have virtually no prospect of re-employment.</P>

I was living in hope that the delay was partially due to the Minister's desire to incorporate in the Bill something to accommodate the 44,000 married women who were so shoddily treated by the previous Government but also by this Government who failed to take steps to rectify the problem.  It is imperative that we should congratulate FLAC on the excellence of their representations on behalf of so many married women.  It has been a long struggle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Poverty cannot be tackled by social welfare alone.  The combined resources of Government Departments are required to deal with it.  The Department of Labour, in particular, have responsibility for creating jobs which is the real solution to poverty.  The Department of Education have responsibility for <Col N="1185" /> training a skilled workforce.  The Department of Finance have to collect the necessary funding to redistribute to the various Government Departments which can do something about poverty.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill effectively is like one leg of a three legged stool in providing a solution for poverty.  It is, of course, tremendously important particularly in society today where there are tremendous divisions not just between rich and poor but between those who are in work and those who are without work. We have an Irish style apartheid in the social segregation of housing.</P>
      <P>The debate on the Social Welfare Bill gives us an opportunity annually to discuss the way the Government are going to redistribute some of the nation's wealth by distributing the taxes that have been collected.  It also gives the Minister an opportunity to outline improvements for insured workers, their spouses and families.  We will be accounting to the hundreds of thousands of workers who pay PRSI and tax at source and for whom we act as a type of banking agency.  This is the annual event which gives us the opportunity to account to the insured workers how their insurance policies are being looked after and to let the unemployed workers know how we are going to redistribute the money collected in taxes.  As we deduct social insurance compulsorily from workers, they are entitled to sufficient benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would like to address the inadequate response by Government to workers whose PRSI is deducted at source.  The Minister did not refer to the problems with the extension of benefits to the spouses of insured workers, for example, the dental services scheme.  It was agreed in 1988 that spouses of insured workers would be entitled to the same dental benefit as the insured worker.  A row with the dentists on the provision of dental treatment has gone unnoticed except by insured workers and their spouses and there has been no solution to date.  If we are taking insurance contributions from workers, we owe them the services for which they are paying dearly.  It is not good enough that the <Col N="1186" /> spouse of an insured worker can be refused dental treatment or asked to pay for it.  This runs completely counter to the legislation.  I was very disappointed that there was no reference to this in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the policy that insured workers are now only entitled to £50 per week under disability benefit and unemployment benefit which is what a person on supplementary welfare is getting.  The Minister will get an opportunity in due course to answer and I would like him to give a thoughtful answer, perhaps in written form.  If workers are paying dearly under the PRSI system for insurance cover, they should be entitled to a service.  I cannot understand that people who are on unemployment benefit under the social insurance scheme will for the first time get only £50 per week as will those who are on disability benefit, which equals what those on unemployment assistance get, in other words, people who have no insurance and are in receipt of assistance from the State. When one goes a step further and sees that people in receipt of long term unemployment assistance will get £55 per week, I can imagine that workers paying PRSI will be angry and ask what is the point of paying PRSI if the State is capable of giving uninsured workers £5 a week more than they would be entitled to if they were in receipt of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in the Minister's answer.  I will wait with bated breath for the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not forget pay related benefit, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not forgotten pay related benefit.  You only qualify for pay related benefit if you contribute under the PRSI system.  It is an insurance policy.  I am arguing that if you insure yourself for the eventuality of unemployment, you are entitled to benefits.  If people go to <Col N="1187" /> the trouble of insuring themselves at the end of the day they should have some benefits in excess of the amount paid to people who have not contributed to the scheme.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately there are a great many people living in poverty in this country and we have to ask where the resources to solve this problem will come from. I am sure the Minister will outline his reasons for not giving a basic minimum income to all above the age of 18 years and why he gave no increases under the child benefit scheme for the first, second and third child but increased the rate only for the fourth child.  No doubt he will tell us about the fiscal restraints and the state of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The money went on child related tax exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is there have been no increases in a great many areas.  The first, second and third child did not receive a brass farthing under the child benefit scheme.  This blows the myth that this budget was good for the family, and that the Minister is so concerned about the family and in particular about children, that he is injecting money into families.  The stark reality is that the Minister has increased the payment only for the fourth child.  The Minister will probably recite the reasons for the inadequacies in the Bill, the state of the economy, fiscal restraints and the fact that the country is up to its neck in debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In excess of one million workers marched for more equity in the tax collection system and for a broader tax base.  Notwithstanding that huge expression of feeling by the workers in general, the situation has not changed much.  The Government said that they had no money to do anything in certain areas.  We cast our minds back to the arguments we used at the time of those marches and remember that we were laughed at by various political and economic groups.  We said there was a huge sum of money out there in uncollected taxes.  The Government <Col N="1188" /> declared an amnesty which the Revenue Commissioners and, by implication, the Minister for Finance, reckoned would bring in approximately £25 million.  We said at the time that that was ridiculous, but it was not very long before we saw these white collared gentlemen, who were so good at cheating and evading their taxes, queueing up with sums in excess of £1 million in their suit cases and handing it over because of the amnesty. In fact, the amnesty brought in £500 million in uncollected taxes.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all that went on because of staff shortages in the Revenue Commissioners, tax dodgers face very little risk of detection.  This has meant that only 694 audits of returns from over 205,000 self-employed individuals took place.  The audits yielded £6.8 million in undeclared liabilities or an average of £9,800 per person.  It is the third year of self-assessment brought in by this Government as the solution to the problem of tax evasion.  Now there is the continuing scandal that if the present rate of audits continues, it would take 290 years to audit every case and the odds are 300 to 1 against being caught.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are dealing with those who are in a poverty trap; we are dealing with the poor of the nation.  We have a very bad public health service.  We are faced with non-co-operation by the Irish Dental Association in extending the scheme to the spouses of insured workers.  I am sick to the teeth hearing that the reason for the inadequacies in the service is that we are up to our neck in debt, that there is no more money out there, despite the fact that we are squeezing everybody for taxes.  The method of collecting taxes has not changed and these taxes are badly needed for our health and social welfare services. That stands as an absolute condemnation of the attitude of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind those gentlemen who are so adept at avoiding taxes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The collection of outstanding taxes is not the responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare.  The <Col N="1189" /> Deputy has made his point in relation to that and how it affects the amount of money available to the Government to help people on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to disagree.  This Bill is brought in as a result of the budget and there are ramifications for social welfare. I am arguing that there are uncollected taxes that could be brought in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point.  The type of activity these white collar gentlemen are engaged in is really on a par with that of the inner city handbag snatcher.  Every penny of tax evaded hurts some unfortunate recipient of social welfare who should have a better standard of living than that being afforded at the moment.</P>
      <P>This year we saw the incredible hosting of a conference in Galway by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could have spent as much as £140,000 and with £80,000 coming from the European Community, that makes approximately £220,000.  The Chair will be familiar with the incredible social deprivation that exists particularly in Dublin's inner city. We see in the programme the recognition of the rights of voluntary organisations to do some work in their communities.  I would, therefore, argue that that money was badly spent.  My feedback from that conference is that people were embarrassed at the way money was spent on a poverty conference.  It is ironic that so many people who are involved at the coal face in their communities should feel so embarrassed by the seemingly endless sources of funds on that occasion.  I would argue that that money would have been far better spent on community programmes in inner city communities with which the Chair is familiar.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like you, Sir, to prevent the Minister interrupting me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are communities in St. Teresa's Gardens, Oliver Bond House, Fatima Mansions, and all over the inner city to whom a tiny proportion of that money would have meant so much.  They are surviving, and the largest flat complex, <Col N="1191" /> Oliver Bond House, has not got even a community hall.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he will tackle all the social welfare problems.  We have the incredible number of 244,000 people unemployed.  Emigration is still unacceptably high.  I would like to ask the Minister about this economic miracle.  If we have an economic miracle, why is poverty still rampant?  Why are there so many people unemployed?  Why is there such child poverty?  In this city in which there is so much poverty the average price of a new house last year was £67,334 and that of a second-hand house £59,903. I mentioned the social segregation in housing and the inability of Government to inject capital to abolish that segregation. This city alone consists of 28 per cent of the population, with 31 per cent of the labour force located here, and 33 per cent of the national unemployment figure.  It should be remembered that 18 per cent of the national workforce are unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is not correct that anybody should endeavour to achieve a solution to the poverty problem through the provisions of this Bill because, in themselves, they cannot do so.  Jobs, and their creation, constitute the only real solution.  Clearly the Department of Education can help in endeavouring to break down the poverty cycle.  While the provisions of the Bill may keep many people's heads floating above water, prevent them sinking into homelessness and dire poverty the stark reality is that there are 74,000 people unemployed in Dublin alone.  Since 1985 a mere 3,000 net new jobs have been created annually; in other words 750 new jobs have been created annually since 1985.  Is the Minister aware &mdash; in any endeavour to combat poverty &mdash; that in Dublin City alone by the year 1996 the Government would need to create 7,500 jobs per annum?  What sort of a long, dark tunnel are we looking into when we talk about poverty?  The stark reality is that there is no solution for many long term unemployed today, at least none forthcoming from the Government. When one views life from the overall <Col N="1192" /> perspective of poverty, unemployment and emigration &mdash; and the sickening claims of economic miracles and successes on the part of Government &mdash; one clearly realises that we have now a two-tier society whose problems are not being addressed by the provisions of this Bill. That is a tragic indictment of the Government.</P>
    <P>On the Social Welfare Bill last year I spoke of the plight of 44,000 Irish women who had resorted to the European Court to seek redress <i>vis-à-vis</i> the chaotic implementation of the EC Directive on equal treatment of men and women in matters of social welfare, which directive was introduced around the year 1978 or 1979.  The record will demonstrate that it was a live issue last year.  Will the Minister tell the House what he intends doing about the non-payment to 44,000 women entitled to payments since that EC Directive was introduced around 1978?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister why there is no commitment to a basic minimum income for all persons above the age of 18.  I know that in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government rejected the notion of a minimum wage.  I do not see any reason why there should not be included in the provisions of this Bill a minimum income for all persons over the age of 18. Many speakers have said already that in our society there are many young adults, men and women, ineligible for unemployment assistance merely because they live at home and are assumed to have a standard of living not requiring any assistance from the State.  However, I accept that those eligible for unemployment assistance under the provisions of this Bill will now be eligible for a minimum payment of £5 on which I congratulate the Minister.  Nonetheless I do not accept that young adults should be given the choice of remaining at home or leaving in order to establish some type of independent existence.  Because of this incredible board and lodgings regulation the reality of life for many young persons is that they leave the family home in order to create an independent existence.  It is not good that, in order to render themselves eligible for a minimum income, they must leave home.  It is not good for them or their families.  The fact is that those young people ineligible for unemployment assistance must leave their homes, move into a flat in, say, Rathmines, sign on and receive unemployment assistance, rent allowance &mdash; I am not quite sure what else they may be entitled to &mdash; with the resultant interruption in the family life and structure. Will the Minister give the matter of board and lodgings which is causing such annoyance to members of all parties due consideration? It is something that is becoming more and more outmoded and needs to be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reference in the <i>Programme <Col N="1195" /> for Economic and Social Progress</i> under the heading: Treatment of Households which reads:</P>
    <P>A review of the treatment of households within the social welfare code has been completed by a special Household Review Group.  The report of this Group will be discussed with appropriate interests.</P>
    <P>Given that that is in our policy also, can the Minister tell us if the appropriate interests include Members of the Dáil? Besides being gagged by certain regulations it appears that we do not constitute the appropriate interested groups. The report continues:</P>
    <P>Developments at EC level in relation to equal treatment on matters of social security will be fully taken into account in the context of the future development of the system.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask, if and when, the Minister will produce that report.  I believe this report arises because of the difficulties resulting from the Hyland case.  Where couples are concerned, if each partner is qualified to receive a social welfare payment in his or her own right, it should be paid at the appropriate rate.  It is also our position that where one partner so qualifies, and the other does not, the latter should receive 70 per cent of the appropriate payment and that it should be paid directly to that partner unless he or she decides otherwise.  In the longer term all adults should receive an individual living income as their own right; for example, the 70 per cent payment should be steadily increased over a period to 100 per cent; for dependent children the payment of 40 per cent of the adult social welfare rate, or the lowest social welfare rate in the case of a non-welfare recipient, should be payable in respect of those under 15; for young people aged 15 to 18 years the proportion should be 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned his commitment to the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and claimed that he was on target.  I do not accept that the <Col N="1196" /> Minister is on target because according to my figures the updated equivalent of the Commission on Social Welfare's 1986 recommendations at today's rate would be £63.  The Minister's minimum rates, so far as I can see, are £50-£55 so, therefore, we are not on target.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The priority rates and the full rates are two different rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The trick term is that they were the priority rates.  I would like to look closer at some of the items on offer since the budget was announced, to be critical of some of them and praise those that are deserving of praise.  The majority of old age pensioners will receive only a £2 per week increase.  Inflation will be running at 3 per cent or 4 per cent by the time this increase is due in July and this, together with the increases in the cost of electricity, clothing, footwear and so on as well as the increase applied annually in respect of local authority rents, means it is likely that instead of being better off, the poor, in many cases will be poorer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the Minister's commitment to a statutory minimum income?  The fact is that this budget, instead of narrowing the gap between people at work and those without work, has actually widened it. There is a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to a 4 per cent increase for workers over the next year but that, too, is the rate of increase that is to apply to social welfare recipients who, because of their much lower basic rate, will find that the gap between them and those in employment will widen.  We in The Workers' Party do not want a two-tier society with widespread social divisions.  That is why in 1983 we welcomed the establishment of a Commission on Social Welfare to review and report on the social welfare system and related social services and to make recommendations for its development having regard to the needs of modern Irish society.  In 1986 the commission made their famous recommendations which were to lead us into this modern Irish society.  Since that time successive Governments were to have implemented <Col N="1197" /> the recommendations of £62 or £63 per week &mdash; not £50 &mdash; as the minimum payment for a single person and £100 for a couple instead of £83 as proposed in this Bill.  I hope the Minister knows the difference that £12 per week can mean to a person in receipt of social welfare and what it would mean to their standard of living.  The recommendation to move by 1993 to the priority level of rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare &mdash; and now as proposed by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; is insufficient and is virtually meaningless as most people on social welfare would, in any event, almost have reached the levels as promised in 1993. The Minister ignores the fact that the commission recommended that a differential of the order of 10 per cent should be maintained between insurance and assistance payments.  That brings me back to the question of the insured worker on benefit and his counterpart who is in receipt of assistance.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are now allowing an unemployed single worker with full insurance benefits only £50 per week. This is the same amount as for people in receipt of unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowances.  The Minister is now penalising insured workers who must be asking: &ldquo;What is the point of paying social insurance if the insurance is at the same level as applies to unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>With all the concern expressed in the Minister's speech of self praise, nothing, as I have said already, has been given in respect of the children's allowance or child benefit except so far as the fourth child is concerned, that increase will not be paid until October which is a long way down the line.</P>
    <P>Under the new carer's allowance provided for last year, the Minister said that in excess of 8,000 carers would benefit. It is, therefore, disgraceful that at least 12,000 applicants have been refused the allowance and instead of the projected 8,000 only 3,500 people are receiving the allowance.  That figure represents 55 per cent less than anticipated by the Minister. <Col N="1198" /> Perhaps the Minister would tell us at some stage how he got his figures so wrong.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to what we heard earlier from other party spokespersons about the incredible sadness caused to the vast bulk of carers in our society because of the strict means testing being applied by the Minister.  We can all cite cases of people we know who, from the goodness of their heart, go to extreme lengths caring for aged people. The savings to the State are incredible when one considers the involvement of so many people, particularly women, who take on the role of caring for a family member or an ageing parent.  It is outrageous that the State does not reciprocate and make a financial contribution to these unfortunate people &mdash; many of whom sacrifice career prospects and, in some cases relationships and marriage, in order to take care of a sick or ailing relative.  Thousands of these people will not be getting one penny as a result of the Bill before us because the allowance is means tested.  Is it any wonder, then, that so many of them believe the Government see their contribution as worthless? Clearly, the Opposition parties have adopted a similar approach to these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the reduction in the age limit from 60 to 58 years for the pre-retirement special allowances.  This reduction in the age limit seems to indicate that the Government believe people are too old to work at 58 years and that they should take the special allowances. I appreciate that this is a voluntary scheme, but I regard it as a con job because it will articially reduce the numbers on the live register.  The introduction of the pre-retirement allowance scheme for persons over 60 years of age on long term unemployment assistance artifically reduce the number on the live register by approximately 5,000.  The reduction in the qualifying age to 58 years is not only an indication of political sleight-of-hand <Col N="1199" /> and dishonesty on the part of the Government, but it also indicates their inability to create jobs.</P>
    <P>When the scheme began in March 1990, 4,731 people transferred from unemployment assistance to the pre-retirement allowance scheme.  The total number of people now in receipt of this pension is 6,104.  The projected increase in the number of people who will qualify for this pension as a result of the age reduction from 60 to 58 years is 1,000 for those aged 58 years and 1,000 for those aged 59 years.  This will bring the number of people in receipt of pre-retirement allowances to 8,104.  I am not a cynic, but I have no doubt that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Labour will stand up here when the unemployment figures are issued, as they do every month, and refer to the great job they are doing and the 8,104 people they have taken off the live register.  However, all that will have happened is that these people who qualified for pre-retirement allowances who are not recorded, will have been taken off the live register.  The Government should not engage in these cynical exercises.  It is very sad that people of 58 years who are basically still young are regarded as too old to work.  This is a stark indication of the direction in which this country is going and the prospects for employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to check that with my party.  Perhaps the Minister would give me the statements made by The Workers' Party which called for the introduction of pre-retirement allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister finds those statements, perhaps he will send them to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to sections 45, 46 and <Col N="1200" /> 47.  Like other speakers, I want to congratulate the Minister for providing that cohabiting couples shall be regarded as spouses.  This is a step in the right direction; it is a social democratic move on the part of Fianna Fáil.  However, when one considers that there is no divorce in this country, this provision could be turned on its head.  While couples are legally allowed to separate, they cannot be divorced. By recognising that many relationships have failed and that people have entered into second relationships, the Minister is, in a sense, ahead of divorce legislation.  I congratulate him on providing that cohabiting couples shall be regarded as spouses to each other.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister, having given them this new title, will financially penalise these people.  This is an unacceptable sting in the tail.  Cohabiting couples, for example, on supplementary welfare allowance, will receive less than they did when they were individually assessed.  As individuals, they would be entitled to £50 a week, a total of £100, but now that they will be regarded as spouses, they will only receive £83, a reduction of £17.  This is not a good move given the fact that very often people whose marriages have broken down are very vulnerable and make up one of the poorest sections in our society.  Marriage breakdown is a traumatic experience and very often these people do not have any social insurance.  It is not fair that they should be penalised in this way by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister for Social Welfare have treated this House in a contemptuous way so far as this Bill is concerned.  We were handed this Bill &mdash; 43 pages, 64 sections, and deals with an incredibly complex area of social welfare &mdash; less than 24 hours ago and expected to come in here this morning with a prepared and researched response. This is not good enough.  The provisions in this Bill were made in advance of the budget but the legislation was not published for a further six weeks.  The needs of people on social welfare, and the legislative needs of this House would be far better served if the Minister spent less <Col N="1201" /> time promoting his Department and himself in public relations exercises and more time ensuring that legislation is circulated in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy ever hear of parliamentary draftsmen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard of parliamentary draftsmen.  If the Minister for Finance could produce his budget six weeks ago I cannot understand, with the number of draftsmen available to both the Minister for Finance and this Minister, why this Bill was circulated only 24 hours ago.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the provisions which will reduce the income of some unmarried couples who are cohabiting.  This decision will simply further impoverish people who already receive inadequate incomes.  The Workers' Party are strongly opposed to these provisions.  We fully support the principle that all couples, whether or not they are married, should be treated equally in the social welfare code.  Unfortunately, once again, the Government have decided to equalise downwards, not upwards.  This move may be in breach of the spirit of the EC directive on social welfare equalisation.  We have enough trouble with this directive without further complicating the issue.</P>
      <P>When the Government made a similar decision in 1989 to reduce the unemployment assistance payable to unmarried couples, following the decision of the Supreme Court in the Hyland case, they established a special review group to consider payments to households.  While that report has been produced it has not been published, almost two year later.  I call on the Minister to publish that report and to allow a full and thorough debate, to take place on its recommendations.</P>

      <P>I am almost finished my contribution.  I understand that the report has been published and as soon as the Minister receives it perhaps we may all see it.  This Bill creates a significant anomaly in our legal system.  While the State will continue to refuse to allow couples whose marriages have broken up to remarry, our social welfare system will treat two spouses from different marriages who live together as a married couple.  In general terms the Bill is disappointing. It fails to deal with the extent or level of poverty.  Increases in line with inflation could only be considered adequate if the basic rates of social welfare were adequate, but this is clearly not the case.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the European Court of Justice announced yesterday, which I better not mention because I got into trouble for mentioning it earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>For historical reasons it is important to point out that the whole process of social welfare equalisation has been botched here.  Most of the responsibility for the mess must rest with the former Minister for Social Welfare, Barry Desmond, who introduced the original Bill in 1985.  Having delayed in implementing the EC directive for almost two years the then Coalition Government introduced the Social Welfare (No. 2) <Col N="1203" /> Bill, 1985, which sought to implement the equality principle in a narrow and restrictive way, with the purpose of saving money at the expense of people who had long been discriminated against by our social welfare system.  I, therefore, congratulate Cotter and McDermott and FLAC.  I hope the Government will provide a speedy solution to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like previous speakers, am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss this Bill.  I compliment the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, for the exceptional progress he has made in improving the position of people who depend on social welfare.  It should come as no surprise to anybody that he has adopted this approach over the past three or four years.  He has a very good track record.  Previously he provided increases of 25 per cent for the less well off when times were supposed to be tough.  Again, the significant increases provided this year are in part related to his commitment to the more deprived sections of the community.  The increases being implemented in this Bill concentrate on the needs of the family and those on low welfare payments, and that is as it should be.</P>
      <P>I will refer to some of the comments of previous speakers.  Deputy Connaughton was the first Opposition spokesperson to contribute.  He referred to a number of issues that need to be addressed, one of which his party leader, Deputy Bruton, floated, that people in receipt of carer's allowance, a very innovative allowance, would lose their medical card.  It must be put on the record of the House that that is totally incorrect.  In the Southern Health Board region the decision not to take away the medical card was taken when the scheme was introduced.  The Minister then directed that all health boards apply the same rule.  People should be aware of that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of inequality, and the case we are not allowed to mention, Deputy Connaughton was the person who raised that matter, but he was very careful to avoid mentioning that it refers <Col N="1204" /> back to the period 1984 to 1986.  Perhaps he was here at the time and, possibly, had some responsibility for it.  Therefore, it ill behoves him to refer in a crowing fashion to that judgment.  On the question of inequality it should be remembered that there are inequalities for male as well as female workers.  In the five or six years the Deputy had an opportunity to do something in this regard he and his colleagues &mdash; this applies also to the Labour benches &mdash; totally ignored the plight of the people who are now getting benefits under the <i>pro rata</i> pension scheme.  The Deputy avoided mentioning the sorting out that was done on mixed pensions last year.  There is a perception that all inequalities relate to female workers, but that is not correct.  The Minister has dealt with this issue at a major cost.  The Government, and the previous Government, supported him by providing the necessary money.  I quote those as examples of what he has achieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton also referred in a sneering fashion to the cliché, the poor must wait.  The performance of the previous Coalition Government can be seen from the records of this House, and the public are aware of it.  The Deputy said there is a public perception that people are better off on the dole.  I will deal with that later, but it was Deputy Bruton, and Deputy Connaughton, who tried to create that perception.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea was very gracious about the improvements in the Bill but he said, as did Deputy Byrne, that there are no great increases in child benefit. Again, this is incorrect.  One thing that must be considered when talking about increases in child benefit is the position in 1987 when Deputy Woods took office. At that time there were 36 different levels of child benefit and practically all have been equalised.  Enormous improvements have been made in this area.  Reference was made earlier to benefit for the fourth child.  There has also been an improvement in that regard.  There was a lot of administration involved, but the bottom line is that the parent is getting the benefit of the equalisation of rates. <Col N="1205" /> As the Minister mentioned in retaliation &mdash; it is seldom he retaliates in the House &mdash; there are child related tax allowances, as some people seem to forget.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the part-time workers' legislation that is more appropriate to the Labour Estimate. Deputy O'Shea said it is a matter of civil rights that children in the home should receive some benefit.  Perhaps that is the case, but I ask him, was it a civil rights matter in the period 1982-87?  If so, why did he and his party not talk about it then? Whey leave it to the present Minister to deal with?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to the carer's allowance.  He and Deputy Connaughton &mdash; Deputy Byrne also mentioned this &mdash; painted an amazing picture of the difficulties faced by people looking after the elderly.  I respectfully suggest that exactly the same conditions existed in 1982-87 and there was no thought put into possibly creating a scheme culminating in a carer's allowance.  I am sure there are anomalies but I have no doubt that the position will be improved.  Last year we called for the extension to recipients of the disabled person's allowance and that has been included this year.  This is a major change and will alleviate Deputy Byrne's worries.  A sum of £8 million is available for the scheme this year so it is incorrect to say that nobody will benefit.</P>
    <P>As I said, the same conditions existed in 1982-87, the same people were making the same sacrifices, but Deputy Connaughton, Deputy O'Shea and their colleagues accepted the situation without doing anything to rectify it.  I am glad that our caring Minister, Deputy Woods, with the support of the Department of Finance, is working in that area.  If I hear of shortcomings in my area through the health boards or my constituency clinic, I will not be slow to point them out.  I sit on a committee with the Minister and he is always receptive to issues or anomalies which arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne assured the House that he was not a cynic and, despite evidence to the contrary, I believe him.  He complained about the short notice in relation <Col N="1206" /> to the Bill.  I am not an expert on draftsmanship but former Ministers have always pointed out that there are delays in that area.  I am sure the Minister is telling the truth.  There was a sneering remark that the Minister would solve all the existing difficulties and problems. The Minister will certainly attempt to do so, and his record since 1987 is proof of his commitment.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, pointed out yesterday that there had been many changes since the early eighties.  I accept that but there is a consistent thread running through our party of caring for all the population.  The record of the different parties speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the largest legislation in the area of social welfare to be introduced in the House since the Minister, Deputy Woods, introduced in 1981 the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act.  The Bill which we are discussing has eight Parts and 64 sections, obviously it is a complex Bill which deals with a wide range of social welfare matters and addresses very important issues.  This has been accepted by previous speakers.  Since the Minister took office this is his seventh major Social Welfare Bill; there have been in excess of 500 amendments and new sections introduced to our social welfare law.  Will the Minister now consider the possibility of introducing a new Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill because a lot has happened since 1981?  When I was elected to the House I read the Bill introduced in 1981 which, as the Minister said, would probably have a lifespan of ten or 12 years.</P>
    <P>There has been recent media publicity, to which I referred earlier, in relation to disincentives to work which has given the impression that more can be obtained by being unemployed than at work.  In this context, it must be said that there are still people who resent the increases paid to the unemployed.  This resentment often comes from the &ldquo;I'm all right Jack&rdquo; brigade, many of whom have inherited their wealth or come from privileged sections of society.  We often hear people saying contemptuously that these people are <Col N="1207" /> better off on the dole than if they were working; the implication is that they are worthless individuals whose unemployment benefits should be reduced so that they will be forced to go out to work. Many of these critics are employers whose notion of a fair wage means that their employees would certainly be better off on the dole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton and Deputy Connaughton probably had an ulterior motive in trying to give that impression over the last couple of weeks.  It is amazing to see the balancing act they are trying to perform between giving that impression to those at work and to avoid announcing that there have been major changes and improvements in the benefits under social welfare.  Deputy Connaughton and his leader must admit that there have been major changes in social welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>My party have a proud record in the area of social welfare and we have invariably given increases higher than the rate of inflation, even in times of economic difficulty.  In the Bill the Minister is increasing rates in some categories by as much as four times the inflation rate.  The anomalies have been brought about by a combination of factors, one is our tax system and the second is the exploitation of low paid workers by many employers.  Those anomalies need to be addressed under these headings instead of restricting social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are proceeding with the reform of the tax system, and it is not just a simple case of reducing tax rates. Their programme must continue to make progress in the effort to exclude more of our lower paid workers from the tax net. It is up to the employers to get the second side of the equation right but it is up to us, as legislators, to compel them to do so.  There has been widespread fraud and abuse of the social welfare system in the past, some of the recipients were <Col N="1208" /> involved in fraud but, very often, it was brought about by unscrupulous employers who would take on workers on condition that they would continue to sign for social welfare.  In this way they were saved the expense of PRSI, etc., and, at the same time, they paid low wages.  In the past four years the Minister has gone a long way towards eliminating abuse where recipients were concerned and in this Bill he has, thankfully, put in provisions which will deal very effectively with rogue employers.  Every right-thinking person in the House will agree that abuse of the social welfare system should be eliminated where possible.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the vast majority of social welfare recipients are honest in their dealings with the Department and receive only their rightful entitlements under the legislation. However, there are people who defraud the system and I welcome the provisions of Part V which is aimed at combating those abuses.  The measures are geared towards employers who collude with employees and fail to inform the Department when they take on new people, fail to keep records and, in many cases, do not deduct PRSI and tax contributions. Any measure introduced to the House to eliminate social welfare fraud will have my full support.  However, we must talk about it rationally and put it in its proper context because it only involves 1 per cent of total payments of £300 million.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of section 7 which relate to the family income supplement; it is the right way to approach the whole question of balancing take home pay <i>vis-à-vis</i> social welfare payments. This has been improved, as the Minister outlined.  It will give added payment to people in low paid employment and will continue to be an important supplement to their income.</P>
    <P>As I said, the extension of the carer's allowance in section 8 is welcome.  Its extension to many categories of social welfare recipients will make a major contribution to community care.  It is totally consistent in helping health executives to achieve their objective in caring for the elderly population in the comfort of their <Col N="1209" /> own homes for as long as possible.  I also ask the Minister to consider one section of our society which seems to have been forgotten by many of us.  I refer to the religious communities who gave such a great service over the years.  At present the religious communities who look after their elderly members are not allowed to claim the carer's allowance.  I ask the Minister to examine the circumstances of priests, nuns and monks involved because many face hardship.</P>
    <P>The extension of payments to surviving spouses in section 9 is welcome.  This morning many of us were worried about the provision in section 210 of the Principal Act whereby benefit and privilege were taken into account in assessing the means of the younger person applying for benefit.  That was a critical area.  People will say £5 is too little, but under this provision people could be assessed and as a result given as little as 1p benefit. The Minister has taken action on that. The old provision created friction in the home and many young people left so that the rent allowance and full social welfare entitlements could be availed of.  That was unsatisfactory and I welcome what the Minister is doing in this respect.  It is a step in the right direction and will give at least a small amount of pocket money to some young people.</P>
    <P>Section 54 enables the Minister to make regulations to withhold from welfare payments an agreed amount which can in turn be paid out to an agreed organisation or any named person.  This is important.  We have worked in this area with the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the credit unions.  I know there are good and bad managers, but the people who need to be most prudent with money are social welfare recipients.  I welcome the provision.  I ask the Minister to accept that since many people find it difficult to manage on their welfare payments, he might consider going a step further and making some kind of arrangement with the local health boards so that these people could be given individual conselling in their own homes, perhaps through the community care network in <Col N="1210" /> each health board.  I appreciate the contributions the Minister has given to voluntary bodies like the St. Vincent de Paul Society but I remind him that many people find it difficult to go to a local group session and admit they do not know how to handle money or their debts.  I ask him to approach this problem on a one to one basis.  If this cannot be done through the health boards, he might consider asking the St. Vincent de Paul Society and others to look at that area. That change is also a step in the right direction and is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Each year I find one or two anomalies which I try to remedy.  Last year it was the DOAPs &mdash; the deprived old age pensioners &mdash; and the Minister has handled that, and another group are adoptive parents who do not get the breaks and concessions natural parents get in maternity benefit, time off, etc.  I ask the Minister if it is within his realm to see if we can provide some kind of benefit for adoptive parents.  They deserve it.  They are a great group of people and I would like to see them helped out in some way.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not being and cannot be taken in isolation.  As I said on the budget debate, we cannot take one budget in isolation.  This is part of the Minister's programme for the past four years.  He set himself targets and is working to achieve them.  This is knitted into the budget and into the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  It is good that we can have that combination and a forward thrust on all these fronts.  That commitment, support and common thinking are most welcome.</P>
    <P>Again I congratulate the Minister and thank him for his attention to the areas I and other Deputies raised last year and the previous year in regard to pensions and so on.  I ask him to continue the good work, and I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>First, I want to deny vehemently that the world started in 1987 and want to put on record that we did not get our freedom in 1987 nor did we have our first Government in 1987.  I want to come to the defence of the great founder of Fianna Fáil, Éamon de Valera, who I am now sure is enjoying celestial happiness, and to apologise to him for the fact that his party's great 16 years from 1932 to 1948 and the period from 1954 to 1973, another long unbroken stint, are completely scrubbed in the history of the Fianna Fáil people who represent him at the moment.  They can only go back to 1987. I just cannot understand why.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I am delighted now.  I have the right defence <Col N="1212" /> here.  I am delighted the Deputy mentioned the period 1984-87 because I have to remind him again of the role Fianna Fáil played in probably the most reckless Opposition of all time, the Deputy reminded me of it and I cannot help reminding him of what they did.  I find it awful that I am reminded of the terrible things that happened in the time of the Opposition as they were at that stage.  I feel sorry for the people who now see emigration for what it is and I remember seeing posters of people queueing to get their visas.  That happened back in the bad old days I am reminded of.  Think of the irresponsibility of it.  Let me remind the House that in those days inflation was at 21 per cent.  Imagine a Government dealing with problems that stem from an inflation rate of 21 per cent and bringing in the requisite increases for pensioners and the unemployed at that rate.  Mind you, they did quite well.  I want to accept a compliment on the family income supplement. It is very nice that we are being complimented for work done before 1987.  Only in this great year, 1987, did things begin to move, and I suppose I had better move on as well.</P>
      <P>I mentioned inflation at 21 per cent; perhaps an increase of 4 per cent is not over exciting, even taking it that Fianna Fáil were handed an inflation under control, down to almost 4 per cent.  One of the key compliments they pay themselves still is that they have inflation under control, which, of course, is not true.  It was brought under control after they had sent it absolutely bananas in the period 1977-81, years we do not want to remember.</P>
      <P>Before I come to the main part of my speech I want to thank the Deputies opposite for making me feel proud to belong to Fine Gael.  The Minister and Deputy Dennehy could not help talking about Deputy Bruton.  Is it not marvellous that at long last here we are, Fine Gael, with a leader who can get Fianna Fáil on their toes every day in the Dáil? I hope the next Fianna Fáil speakers can resist mentioning what a wonderful job Deputy Bruton is doing for Fine Gael at the moment.</P>

      <P>Social welfare is related to the awful scourge of unemployment.  Unemployment has been painted with a PR brush in an unbelievable manner.  I get shivers when I see Ministers appearing on television discussing unemployment. One Minister explained that the unemployment figures had gone up because students did not emigrate as they used to and another said it was because emigrants did not leave again after Christmas.  Is not that some propaganda?  While people were emigrating it was all right to claim that unemployment was under control. Nothing is further from the truth and we must face reality.</P>
      <P>FÁS schemes are taking people off the unemployment register.  When a married woman goes into an employment exchange she gets a terrible grilling.  I know of a woman who came out in tears and would not go back although I did my best to get her to appeal.  Married women are supposed to be unavailable for work or are not looking for work.  Every effort is being made to discourage married women from being on the unemployment register.  If they were included the figure would be different.</P>
      <P>Employment creation is the job of the Minister for Labour whereas the Minister for Social Welfare must cater for those who are unemployed.  If we were in Utopia we could pay more.  I have come across people who feel sick at the thought of having to sign on the unemployment register.  There is a perception at large that most unemployed people do not want to work and would not work to warm themselves.  That may hold for some, but the vast majority would do anything rather than sign at the employment exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> I hope next year the Minister will be able to increase social welfare payments because of the wonderful, blooming economy we have under what is supposed to be the best Government ever.</P>

      <P>I can accept that there is a limit to the Minister's purse as well, but perhaps next year he will be able to give more.  Since I have the responsibility to speak for the aged, I must admit that I am disappointed the Minister was not magnanimous enough to admit that it was my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who put down the amendment to the Social Welfare Bill to introduce a carer's allowance.  The Minister asked him to withdraw the amendment and said the Government would amend the Bill to the same effect.  The Deputy acceded to the Minister's request, and today the Minister went out of his way to denigrate the Fine Gael Party who have done nothing about a carer's allowance.  The Minister should have stayed neutral at least.</P>

There was no mention of it until Deputy O'Keeffe put down an amendment.  The Minister is too big by nature to have fallen into that trap and perhaps he will acknowledge it when summing up and will compliment Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on what he did for carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister could <Col N="1215" /> let anyone advise him to give an allowance of £2 to carers before starting to deduct money from them.  When a young lad who has just made his confirmation knocks on the door, one can hardly give him less than £2, and here we have a new scheme, at the instigation of Fine Gael, under which a person can earn £2 and then the Minister will start deducting £2 for every £2 earned.  This is a shambles. The carer's allowance has turned out to be a damp squib that had all the glamour and appeal of something great but it has not worked out in reality.</P>
    <P>This £2 allowance must have been proposed when someone came out of the archives in some deep cave in the Department of Social Welfare, someone who knew that £2 was a lot of money in the time of Brian Boru.  Will the Minister please deal with this and with the idea that people on social welfare can earn this money without being affected?  We are only juggling with the money. Women getting this allowance are simply taking it from the husbands.  Yesterday I talked to a woman who was so indignant when she found that all she was doing was taking the money from her husband's unemployment assistance, that she said she would send back the book and would not use it, out of a sense of loyalty to her husband who always shared his money with her.  It turned out that she would get £8 more than before, so I advised her to take the £8 rather than send back the book.</P>
    <P>The Minister came on CKR, the leading local radio in the country, covering Kildare, Carlow, Wicklow and places like that, and explained how wonderful was this carer's allowance.  The interviewer suggested that there were many happy people listening to the Minister and the Minister assured the interviewer that there were certainly thousands of people who were very happy with this carer's allowance.  The Minister slept peacefully that night following that propaganda.  As a public representative I felt I should go on the radio the following day to do my duty.  I acknowledged that the Minister is a grand man, that he is nice and that he <Col N="1216" /> had introduced this scheme, but I said I would not spend a fortune in anticipation of the money we would get from this scheme which did not get off the ground. It started this time last year.  We talked about it and complimented the Minister and we were worn out during the summer making inquiries about it.  It was October before the claim forms came out, a whole year was used for propaganda exercises. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what the advertisements cost in case the proportion has gone out of balance altogether. I have an idea that the advertisements must have cost a lot in relation to the overall cost of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>I welcome the six weeks allowance for widows and parents.  Nothing should be put in the way of people at a time of sadness and tragedy.  The procedure for paying allowances should be simplified as much as possible.  I also welcome the section dealing with measures to combat fraud.  It should be borne in mind, and I have taken this matter up with the Minister for Finance, that employers sometimes have difficulty in obtaining payments.</P>

That is the reason they felt it necessary to set up this organisation.  It is in everyone's interest that legislation be enacted to enable the Minister to recognise them.  I call on the Minister of State, once again, to meet with them and introduce the necessary legislation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 32 together.  I would invite attention to the statement made in relation to this matter during the course of the Adjournment Debate on 22 November last.  The position has not altered in the meantime.</P>
      <P>I should say that, while I, too, have every sympathy for widows whose late husbands chose not to become members of the contributory scheme, it would be inappropriate at this stage to extend the scope of the scheme to cover cases where the liability involved had already matured.  In this regard, I must emphasise that the scheme is based on the insurance &mdash; and not the assistance &mdash; principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that these widows are the victims of circumstances, that their rights and entitlements were signed away by their husbands and that they had no knowledge of the fate that would befall them on the death of their husbands? Will the Minister of State now outline the position of these women?  Their husbands had the authority to sign their rights away at the time but they have been neglected and are the innocent victims of circumstances. Will the Minister of State <Col N="1220" /> have their cases re-examined with a view to having them included in the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the widows concerned but I should point out that membership of the scheme was compulsory in the case of personnel who enlisted on or after 1 February 1978.  In the case of soldiers who served at any time between 1 June 1977 and 31 January 1978 membership of the scheme was voluntary. Therefore, such soldiers had to be given the choice as to whether they wished to join the scheme or not.  In addition to those who opted to join the scheme, those who neglected to exercise any option were actually enrolled as members.  Thus, only those soldiers who specifically gave notice in writing that they were opting not to enter the scheme were not enrolled.  This was done at their own request and there was no misunderstanding about this at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I put it to the Minister of State that while the soldiers were given a choice their spouses were not and that the decision of the soldier had implications for the spouse on the death of the soldier?  Those spouses had their entitlements signed away.  Will the Minister of State outline their position under EC directives and legislation dealing with equality and pension rights?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 42 together.  Tenders were invited by my Department in July last for the supply of an executive jet aircraft.  A technical and economic evaluation of the various offers made to supply aircraft has been proceeding and no contract has been placed to date for the acquisition of an executive jet aircraft.</P>
      <P>The leasing and fuel costs of the Gulfstream III aircraft currently leased amount to about £2 million for the period from 1 January 1990 to 28 February 1991. No modifications were carried out and no extra equipment was acquired for the aircraft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be even more helpful if the Minister would listen to the question and try to answer it.  Given the figures and the cost of leasing to the end of next September, would the Minister not agree that it is proving to be impracticable and uneconomical?  The Government are spending more on leasing the aircraft than it would have cost to buy it in the first instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>

      <P>Women will be eligible to fill a wide range of appointments in the FCA subject to the same restrictions which apply to the Permanent Defence Force, whereby women do not serve in appointments which may require them to take part in direct operational duties under arms.  In practice this means women will be mainly employed in service corps units, including Signals, Supply and Transport, Military Police and the Medical Corps.  I can certainly say that the necessary arrangements will be in place in good time to suit the recruitment of women.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the Minister that women coming into a non-traditional area of work for the first time will require, as in other areas, a high degree of sensitivity and understanding.  Will the Minister bear in mind that the women who will be recruited will not stay if they find that the necessary procedures are not in place to ensure that their transition is made a happy one?</P>

Is the Minister aware that officers in command of local units of the FCA have refused women entry into the FCA because of the appalling conditions and lack of facilities in the local FCA headquarters?  Quite a number of young women who have applied have been turned down.  In fact, some were asked to get in contact with the Minister on this matter.  The existing facilities of the FCA are appalling and there are no facilities for women.

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his answer but I assure him it is a very depressing picture and the situation has not changed in the past six or seven years.  Is it not time that the bar on women taking part in combat duties should be lifted?  Should women in the Army not be brought under the Employment Equality Agency and under equality legislation?  Is it not time that it should be possible for women who want to be involved in active combat duty to be allowed do so?  I would remind the Minister of the role of women in the Gulf War and in Grenada where they served in combat forces of the US Army.  Is the Minister not aware that a lot more happens in armies than people going <Col N="1230" /> around killing each other?  Will the Minister give an assurance that the commitment given by the former Minister for Defence to review the whole area of legislation which so inhibits women in the Army will be forthcoming from him?</P>

      <P>I am touched by the Minister of State's concern for women.  I believe that women do not fulfil a worthwhile role because all the worthwhile roles in the Army are filled by men. Would the Minister consider the fundamental question of the protective paternalism or paternal protectionism which is perpetuated year after year here as well as everywhere else.  It is unnecessary. It should be examined and challenged to enable those women who want to be part of the combat force and make a career in the Army &mdash; I would not want to, and many other people would not want to &mdash; but the women who want to should have the choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>As you already said earlier, Deputy, there is more to membership of an army than fighting.  On the two occasions I have been out to visit our troops in the Lebanon there was a number of women serving with our forces and working with their male counterparts side by side.  That is a very progressive step and it is improving all the time. There has even been a further development, as I indicated in response to your question, because for the first time girls have been admitted to apprenticeships. That type of progress will continue.</P>

Could the Minister give a commitment to the House that women will have equal opportunities of recruitment to all positions in the Army, be it apprenticeships, regulars or cadets?  Will he have the present structures examined so that women can be given equal opportunities right across the board in the Army?  The women are out in Lebanon working side by side with their male colleagues, but the Minister is implying that they are there as an addendum to the male soldiers.

      <P>The Gleeson Commission recommended that revised superannuation schemes for the Defence Forces should be drawn up by my Department in consultation with the military authorities and the representative bodies and highlighted various aspects of the <Col N="1239" /> existing arrangements requiring detailed examination in this context.</P>
      <P>The redesign of the Defence Forces superannuation schemes will involve a fundamental reappraisal of the existing arrangements and will be, in the words of the commission, &ldquo;a task of considerable technical complexity&rdquo;.  It is envisaged that the task will take some considerable time to complete.  I am not in a position at this stage to say what the likely outcome will be.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that over 60 per cent of the recommendations of the Gleeson report have already been implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has missed again.  He said that 60 per cent of the recommendations in regard to superannuation have been implemented.  My question is: of the specific recommendations of the Gleeson report, at paragraph 10.8.16, that a review process involving negotiation should be initiated &mdash; to quote the report &mdash;&ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;, that was in July of last year, has that process been initiated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for discussion between their elected representatives and the Department.  All of these matters are being discussed and it will be a matter of time before they are finalised.  Indeed I might add that the existing superannuation scheme is quite favourable &mdash; according to the Gleeson report &mdash; and some of the recommendations of Gleeson move away a little from the existing scheme, in some cases being a little better and in others a little worse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again we are at cross-purposes. Do I correctly interpret the <Col N="1240" /> Minister as telling us that specific discussions on the superannuation schemes have not begun and that the Minister is still in the process of negotiating the terms of reference with the various representative associations?  As a consequence thereof &mdash; particularly in regard to those people close to retirement age to whom this issue is crucial &mdash; will there be any retrospective provision made for whatever conclusions are drawn up in respect of superannuation so that, whatever changes are implemented in this area, might be retroactive to the date on which Gleeson reported, that was 31 July 1990?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">

      <P>I am aware of it and the matter is being considered.  The Deputy should remember that Gleeson made a huge number of recommendations all of which will take some considerable time to be implemented.  A lot of progress has <Col N="1242" /> been made very quickly in dealing with many of them in that over 60 per cent have been dealt with already.  Excellent progress has been made with tremendous co-operation on all sides.  The rate of progress has been satisfactory.  Nonetheless, there are some matters somewhat more complex than others.  We must remember that these matters have been a source of dissatisfaction over many years and will not be resolved overnight, particularly since there are so many of them. Sixty per cent of the recommendations have been agreed already and we are now into the final lap.  Hopefully all of the recommendations will be agreed one way or the other within a short period.</P>

      <P>I welcome the news from the Minister that at this time there is no question of the closure of Longford Barracks or the reduction of Army personnel. I am sure the Minister is aware of the importance of the barracks to Longford, where there has been a long and significant association with military personnel.  I understand from the Minister that improvements have been carried out but that work has now come to an end.  In the not too recent past there was a policy to extend the Army barracks in Longford.  Has this policy now been dropped by the Government?</P>

      <P>A number of works proposals have been made.  As I have already indicated, works costing £30,000 have been completed.  A number of proposals for additional works have been <Col N="1245" /> received and are being considered at present which would cost over £100,000. In relation to further development or extension of the barracks, that is a separate matter.  Certainly, the works proposals before the Department at present will be considered in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 14 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council of Defence stands established under the Defence Act, 1954, to aid and counsel the Minister on all matters in relation to the business of the <Col N="1246" /> Department of Defence on which he may consult the council.  The council comprises the Minister of State at the Department of Defence together with the senior civil and military officers of the Department. As the Minister has ready access individually and collectively to the persons who are members of the council the functions of the council are in practice exercised on a routine basis.</P>
    <P>There was one formal meeting of the council in the last ten years, which took place in 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised at the Minister's reply.  It is obvious that this council is not relevant today on the basis of what the Minister has said.  In view of the Gleeson report, which states clearly that there is a need for a new structure, comprising senior military and senior civil servant management, would the Minister not agree to consider setting up such a structure to meet the needs of present day conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The council met in August 1987 to advise the Minister on the setting up of the defence policy review.  That was the first meeting for 13 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response, in which he stated that the purpose of the meeting was to advise the Minister on the setting up of the defence policy review, is interesting.  May I ask <Col N="1247" /> the Minister how relevant is the Council of Defence and why, in view of 1992 and a united Europe, the council has not been convened since 1987 to further consider development of the defence policy review?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Civil Defence comprises five basic disciplines, namely the warden service, the rescue service, the casualty service, the welfare service and the auxiliary fire service.</P>
      <P>The warden service, which includes a specially trained cadre of scientific advisers, are equipped with radiation measuring equipment to measure levels of radiation in the atmosphere and have access to a comprehensive communications network with telephone, radio and fax equipment to convey their findings to county and national centres. Apart from this, volunteers from this service would be available to assist the Garda in the regulation of traffic and crowd control.</P>
      <P>The rescue service are trained and equipped specifically for the location and removal of persons from collapsed buildings and crash sites generally, including crashed aircraft.  Apart from standard rescue equipment, they also have custom made trailers containing power cutting equipment and accident-site illumination sets.  The rescue service work in close co-operation with the casualty service which have first-aid training and equipment, including ambulances. The welfare service are trained and equipped to feed victims and those involved in rescue or relief work on site and to help those under stress.  The auxiliary fire service are trained and equipped to support the regular fire services as required and to contribute to all rescue efforts.</P>
      <P>The transport fleet available to Civil Defence countrywide is composed of minibuses, four-wheeled drive jeep-type vehicles and a small number of single deck buses.  A total of 10,000-12,000 effective volunteers are available throughout the country for general emergency purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An emergency of the type mentioned in the question would result in the Major <Col N="1255" /> Peacetime Nuclear Accident Plan being brought into effect by the Department of Energy.  The Civil Defence organisation has specific roles within this plan for which they have been trained and equipped. Those roles relate primarily to radiation monitoring, sampling of soil, water and vegetation, and in the implementation of control measures.  Many other agencies would, of course, also have major involvements in such an emergency.</P>

      <P>This commitment was confirmed recently when it was stated, in the context of the enhanced search and rescue service at Shannon, that the Government are committed to deploying a Dauphin helicopter to Cork, primarily for operation with <i>LE Eithne</i> and to be based in Cork when not embarked on that ship.</P>

The Government decided at that time that the helicopter should be located in Cork as soon as possible, primarily for operation with the <i>LE Eithne.</i> It would be located in Cork when not embarked on the vessel.  The necessary arrangements to implement that decision are now being put in place.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the payment is only part of the problem of the two weeks camp. As far as FCA personnel are concerned they feel they need the full two weeks training in order to be properly and effectively trained.  One week's training does not give them the necessary familiarity with military equipment.  This is a very serious matter.  The money is one issue but the real problem is the lack of morale among those who have pride in being members of the FCA and who want to give service to this country.  It arises as a result of the two weeks camp not being provided.  Will the Minister give the House some indication, rather than saying the matter will be reviewed, as to when the two weeks camp will be restored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that the decision taken as long ago as 1983, and sustained by his Government for the past three years, amounts to no more than a mean and petty act.  The overall savings to the Department are minuscule in comparison to expenditure <Col N="1258" /> in other areas.  Would the Minister accept that if his Department moved with speed in implementing Mr. Gleeson's report and dismantled the double tier of bureaucracy that exists in the Department, and the Defence Forces, there would be huge savings available to him to reinstate this very important and much appreciated morale-boosting two weeks course for members of the FCA?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to tell the House that since the change was introduced in 1983 the number attending annual training has remained at 9,000, which is a tremendous compliment to the members of the FCA.  I compliment them on their dedication.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the effective training period on a one week training course is two days.  Two days are spent preparing to go on camp, two days training and the remaining time preparing to come back.  Therefore, the State is losing out.

I visited FCA training camps last year and they are reasonably adjacent to the residence of each member. Members commence training on the afternoon they arrive and they also train on the day of their departure.  Therefore, no time is lost.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Before the break I referred to PRSI and PAYE payments which had to be made every month and I made the point that some employers only make payments every couple of months.  Indeed, one semi-State body are three months behind in their payments and a curt letter from the Department asking for a cheque by return of post does not do justice to a situation like that.  However, I will not labour that point.</P>
      <P>The proposed increased charges for local telephone calls will be deplorable in so far as the aged are concerned and they will be fought tooth and nail by everybody involved.  There is no doubt that old people worry about telephone charges; a woman of 73 years of age came to me some time ago because she was worried about what would happen when the charges were increased.  Even though I assured her that they had not yet been brought in &mdash; and that more than likely they would not come in &mdash; she told me that she would be afraid to contact people because of the bill.  I am sure her bills would not be very high but it would certainly negative the 4 per cent increase granted to the elderly if they had to spend too much on telephone calls.</P>
      <P>Television licences for black and white sets are free to many social welfare recipients. At this stage, very few people watch black and white television sets and while it would add an extra cost to the Exchequer, as a gesture of support to the aged, free colour television licences should be granted to them as it costs quite a bit to pay the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also anomalies in relation to free travel; People in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance may travel free but a companion cannot. I also raised the question of a person in residential care who was refused a free travel pass.  I hope that has been dealt <Col N="1292" /> with on another level because, if somebody is severely handicapped and is in residential care, that person should get free travel.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The Minister should pursue that matter and I will pursue him.  Community alert in rural areas has done quite a lot to reassure old people living alone; they have provided them with alarms and bleepers and they are worthy of support because many people give their time voluntarily.  The length of time it takes social welfare officers to visit people &mdash; in the country at any rate &mdash; is unforgiveable.  The length of time it takes to get a report back from Sligo in relation to an investigation is unbelievable.  If there is understaffing in that area we should do something about it because people must get money and if they have to wait a minimum of six weeks before they are interviewed, it is very difficult for them.  I do not know why there is such a delay but I worry that community welfare officers might end up the same way although, at present, they are effective, quick, deal with emergencies and quickly report back.  I hope they will not end up like the social welfare officers as far as delays are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I do not mind as long as they are not equally bad in relation to delays.  I am also concerned about the assessments on young people living at home.  It is an unusual system in that one person's board and lodging may be calculated at £8, another calculated at £18 and, indeed, in one case, a girl was given £39.  I do not know what one is supposed to do if one is <Col N="1293" /> unemployed.  Is one supposed to take off like the birds into the bushes and chirp there all night?  If someone has an income which appears to be high, one can take it for granted that they are fleeced by income tax and every other tax which is imposed.  It is grossly unfair to the parents of these people.</P>
      <P>The rate of pay for a home help is pre-Brian Boru at £1 per hour.  If we had home helps looking after the elderly we would save hospital bills and the taking up of beds in hospitals.  However, we cannot encourage people to get involved for that rate of pay.</P>
      <P>The free beef scheme has caused quite a lot of problems because of those excluded and the number of people in one house who could get it.  I suppose that, no matter how many people are let into a scheme, there will be as many more left out but the case was made to me that five people could benefit from one social welfare scheme by getting five helpings of meat while a widow might get none. A list contained in a document which came from the unemployed states that there is no beef for those on social employment schemes.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I accept that there is a limit but, at the same time, we must try to have equality in relation to it.  The subject closest to my heart, after the care of the elderly, is medical referees.  I have spoken a few times in this regard.  It is incredible that a person can visit a specialist in Dublin, have all kinds of tests involving modern machinery, and then be called before a medical referee who decides, from looking at a document and across the table, that this person is fit for work.  There is something grossly wrong with such a decision-making process.  I could outline several cases where professors in Dublin hospitals deal with people and are indignant when their diagnosis is questioned. <Col N="1294" /> If a person has a letter from a hospital outlining his or her illness it should be sufficient.  This position should no longer be tolerated.</P>
      <P>There is a row at present between the dentists and the Department and it should be possible to fix it.  We had one dentist in Carlow, he had a car accident and now we do not have anybody.  It is all very well claiming that if one pays PRSI one is entitled to free dental care but if a dentist is not available it is not much use to that person.  I am almost afraid to mention the word &ldquo;orthodontics&rdquo;. There has been an improvement as a result of the appointment of a woman for two days but the shortage of orthodontists presents a problem right across the country.  Apart from their scarcity, we must consider the payment they can get in private practice.  I suggested when I was on the health board that there should be a different scale of fees for orthodontists if we are to encourage them to enter the system.  There is no point in tying them to the existing level because they would be taking a massive drop in salary.  We need them because young people growing up must get every chance of proper treatment.  It is pathetic to find parents coming in with a child who, perhaps, has a tooth growing outside his normal set of teeth being told it is not a major medical problem, the child will be OK, it is cosmetic.  I know that cosmetic orthodontic treatment may not be considered strictly necessary but, as in the case of the village schoolmaster, pride attends us still.</P>

      <P>Once again the Minister for Social Welfare is to be congratulated on introducing extensive social welfare legislation into this House.  This Bill contains 64 sections and deals with a broad range of issues.  Social welfare fraud is increasing alarmingly.  In reply to a recent Dáil question I was shocked to learn that out of a total of 505 cases detected in the Cork area over the period 1988-90 only 22 cases were prosecuted.  I am not satisfied that enough is being done to tackle fraud in our social welfare system.  The only deterrent is the fear and certainty that if one steals from the State by defrauding it of social welfare payments, (1) one will be caught and (2) one will be prosecuted. On both these counts we have failed. The social investigation unit, the joint investigation unit, the external control unit and the fraud control unit are not able to cope with their job.  They are understaffed and overworked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the opportunity for fraud exists in any system, be it social welfare, grants or subsidies to industry or agriculture, or taxation, and control measures are necessary especially where public funds are concerned.  The control measures we have in place are not adequate.  I am satisfied that fraud in our social welfare system now extends to every scheme from unemployment assistance to employers failing to deduct tax and PRSI contributions.  Information on these types of fraud seems to be generally known locally, yet the Department of Social Welfare appear to take little or no action.  Of the 505 cases detected only 22 prosecutions followed.  I suggest to the Minister that signing on a daily or weekly basis at employment exchanges involves a huge amount of clerical work which has to be done manually.  Reducing signing periods to monthly or quarterly would allow staff to be redeployed and retained to make more random checks to ensure <Col N="1296" /> that claimants are genuine and entitled to payment.</P>
    <P>In recognising that control measures are necessary I am also concerned that the overwhelming majority of claimants whose entitlements are genuine be not stigmatised or subject to a regime which would infringe their dignity or sense of entitlement.  I welcome the broad measures in Part V of this Bill, but they do not go far enough.  Collusion between employer and employee is only part of the equation.  The biggest offenders are those claimants who each week claim benefits they are not entitled to.  I urge the Minister to give this matter his most urgent attention.  It should go out clear to all who are abusing the system that they are depriving the most genuine social welfare cases.  They continue so to deprive them, and it is little wonder that we come to the House asking the Minister to increase this or that service while people are out there defrauding the depriving such people of their entitlements.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable controversy about the relationship between unemployment and work incentives and I welcome the provisions of section 7 regarding the family income supplement. I do not believe there is evidence that any substantial part of the increase in unemployment which has occurred over a period of time is due to the so-called disincentive to work syndrome.  The overwhelming majority of people who are unemployed at the moment want to work.  Unemployment is a negative, destructive experience financially, socially and pyschologically.  I do not accept that there is a great incentive to give up work for higher payments from the State.</P>
    <P>The progress we have made with the family income supplement should be continued and I applaud any improvement in this respect.  It should be advertised further to encourage the maximum take-up. The problem where it arises is not confined to the choice between working in the formal economy and drawing social welfare payments but is a choice of working in the black economy and being a recipient of social welfare payments. <Col N="1297" /> On grounds of efficiency a difference should be retained; on the grounds of equity the position of the low paid workers <i>vis-à-vis</i> social welfare recipients should be improved.  The provisions of this Bill will go a long way towards achieving that.</P>
    <P>A loophole in the law relating to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme arose because health boards could take into consideration only the means of the applicant or his spouse and as a result cohabiting couples could obtain more than married couples.  Section 45 provides that for the purpose of a supplementary welfare allowance the needs and means of a couple cohabiting as man and wife will be aggregated as in the case of a married couple.  Cohabiting couples will receive the same rate of payment as applies to married couples in the same circumstances.  I believe health boards generally will welcome these provisions. However, I must sound a note of caution.  It is extremely difficult to prove cohabitation in many cases.  Social welfare recipients will enter into a relationship and it can be very difficult to prove that X and Y are living together as husband and wife.  They may visit each other at weekends and even during the week when sexual relations will occur.  The criteria set out in the supplementary benefit handbook in Britain and judically approved in a commission's decisions, reference RD3/81 and RSV/1781, should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister and his officials to set out for field staff rules that must be complied with in order to establish a cohabitation relationship, for example, with reference to the existence of a common household, stability of relationship, financial support, sexual relationships, children and public acknowledgement of the relationship, and so on.  If we do not do that now we will run into difficulties and the appeals system will be clogged up with claims and counter claims in relation to determining cohabitation relationships.  The Minister should consider this.</P>
    <P>Section 43 is welcome.  I understand for the provisions of it that the funding <Col N="1298" /> of health boards in relation to supplementary welfare allowance will now be done on a gross basis rather than on a net basis and that the cumbersome procedures of transferring refunds from various branches of the Department of Social Welfare to health boards will now cease.  This will relieve clerical staff in the health boards to engage in other work.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 54 and its provisions in relation to budgeting and household management facilities which the Department of Social Welfare are planning in conjunction with An Post.  The bulk of social welfare recipients are paid through the post office system and the budget management facility will give greater scope to people to plan and manage their financial affairs.  The vast majority of social welfare recipients are in their local credit union so I would ask the Minister to allow social welfare recipients the choice of having this service provided by An Post or the credit union.  The Lough Credit Union in my city of Cork has made tremendous progress in helping families on social welfare to manage money more prudently and they have also tackled the terrible scourge of money lenders, who have inflicted so much hardship on so many social welfare recipients.  While there may be technical reasons for not implementing my suggestions at the moment I would ask the Minister to give it serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are broadly welcome.  In 1990 the Bill introduced by the Minister had seven parts and 51 sections. It was the largest new Social Welfare Bill in almost 40 years apart from the 1981 Consolidation Act. the Minister has gone further on this occasion by introducing more substantial legislation here. Perhaps it is time the Minister thought about introducing a new Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to section 209 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act in so far as it applies to persons paying local authority grants.  The Minister in his speech said that the Commission on Social Welfare report indicated that almost half of those on unemployment <Col N="1299" /> payments have no rent or mortgage commitment. This may be true.  However, at the end of 1989 there was a total of 715,540 recipients of various types of benefit from the Department.  If 50 per cent of those had no rent or mortgage commitment it is logical to assume that 50 per cent had.  Many of those reside in local authority accommodation and are not allowed by health boards to claim a rent subsidy under the provisions of section 209 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act.  In the Cork Corporation area there are 10,000 people in local authority accommodation paying rents at a minimum of £8 up to a maximum of £11. If the total number of social welfare recipients represent 20 per cent of the population it is safe to assume that there must be at least 2,000 of them on social welfare payments who are not receiving a supplementary welfare allowance and a rent allowance.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister on 21 February 1991 about this matter and the Minister replied to a Dáil question on 5 March 1991.  The reply was not to my satisfaction. The Minister is aware that the differential rent system determines the maximum amount of rent payable by a tenant to a local authority.  The formula which relates to rent takes into consideration the family income, the size of the family and the composition of the family.  Until August 1986 the formula for assessing differential rent was uniform among local authorities but after that the scheme was devolved to individual local authorities.  The potential overlap between supplementary welfare allowance and local authority differential rents was small up to 1986 but since then the position has changed dramatically.  Local authorities have considerably increased their rents in order to cope with public finance problems.  Many families on social welfare are now paying local authority rents which amount to £15 or £20. This is certainly the case in Cork County Council.  These families are being denied the basic right of a rent allowance under the provisions of the 1981 Consolidation Act.  It is questionable as to whether <Col N="1300" /> health boards are really entitled to refuse people in local authority houses rent supplement. By excluding them under the provisions of section 209 the Minister is acting <i>ultra vires</i> the spirit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to seriously consider this aspect of the supplementary welfare allowance.  If a person on a mortgage can no longer pay the local authority can they subsidise the payment?  Where there is hardship in relation to a local authority family home this is not available irrespective of the hardship.  Since the health boards operate the supplementary welfare allowance scheme under the control of the Minister for Social Welfare, I call on the Minister to instruct the health boards to give rent subsidies to families so that they get their basic legal entitlements which will help them to eliminate poverty and hardship.</P>
    <P>There is no point in giving me the standard reply to this question.  I am constantly being told that health boards do not normally pay rent supplements to persons paying differential rents and that it is open to local authorities to invoke hardship clauses under the differential rent scheme so as to reduce the rent charge.  That does not happen.  County managers never exercise their right to reduce rents in cases of hardship.  Indeed, they rarely reduce the amount of rent in arrears even when it comes to evicting families.  I would be failing in my duties as a public representative if I did not make every effort to highlight this issue. I hope the Minister agrees with me on the question of rent subsidies to local authority tenants and that his officials will examine the matter and make every effort to rectify this wrong as an injustice is being done.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing yet another major Bill which will reform the social welfare system and improve the lot of social welfare recipients. My party agree that this Bill should pass through the House.  Even though I can at times be critical of certain aspects of the social welfare system, I want to say that the Minister has done more for social welfare recipients than any other Minister since I became a Member of this <Col N="1301" /> House.  I believe that he is a man who keeps in touch with the grassroots and is fully aware of the problems facing the less fortunate in our community.  Long may this continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution I would like to deal with the questions of poverty and social deprivation.  My party's Front Bench spokesperson, Deputy Connaughton, dealt with the provisions of the Bill in great detail and at length and I apologise if I repeat some of the points he made.</P>
      <P>Poverty is becoming more deep-rooted in this country every day and it is clear that the Government have failed miserably to take the problems of poverty, social deprivation and division seriously. The question of how to eliminate poverty is nowhere near the top of the Government's agenda and the Social Welfare Bill before us illustrates this.  The Government seem to be determined to ensure that a great many of our people remain dependent on the State.  While handouts and payments are vital in dealing with the symptoms of poverty and social deprivation, they are of no use in tackling the root causes.</P>
      <P>I said last year in the House that the gap between the poor and the better off was widening by the day.  It is sad that one year later I have to say that the gap between the very rich and the very poor has widened even further.  While the Minister has made some attempt to tackle some of the issues he has made no attempt to deal with the root causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish are a very generous people. One can give many examples of the way they have responded to major problems on the world stage.  I have no doubt that if they were encouraged and given incentives to help out in their communities they would do so, because they do not want a two-tier society.  They are anxious to help but their goodwill has not been tapped.  The Government have instead decided to continue their policy of handouts and are determined to ensure that the statutory bodies retain control.  I am aware from my experience as a member of a health board that the statutory bodies <Col N="1302" /> are unable to tackle the social problems in our communities in an effective or efficient way.  I have no doubt that voluntary groups could do this if given the necessary encouragement and resources, but I regret to say that the heavy hand of bureaucracy has not been lifted.  I have also no doubt that the efforts of voluntary groups, particularly when it comes to care for the elderly, are resented.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government do not believe their own hype and are not blinded by the glare of television cameras at press conferences when attempting to project that the economy is on the uplift and that everything is coming right.  While some people are reaping the benefits of this, unfortunately the poor are being bypassed. In stating that everything will be OK and that the economy is on the uplift one is ignoring factory closures and the increase in unemployment.  The figures speak for themselves.  For example, the figures indicate &mdash; I sought to raise this matter on the Adjournment tonight &mdash; that there has been a 5 per cent increase in the number of people drawing unemployment benefit and assistance in February 1991 in Cork city alone as compared with the figure for February 1990.</P>
    <P>I would argue that the rich and influential are doing very well but the poor are being buried and forgotten.  For varying reasons I have spent a fair bit of time in the cities of Central and South America. The poverty in some of our cities &mdash; I am not overstating this &mdash; reminds me of what I have seen in some of the cities there.  I have seen housing units being neglected and abandoned as people could no longer continue to live in them.  People in our cities &mdash; I am not familiar with problems of rural areas &mdash; are not being allowed to live out their lives with dignity or make the most of their opportunities. Whole generations of families never get the opportunity to gain meaningful employment and are condemned to poverty and despair.</P>
    <P>Even though 200,000 people in our cities are awaiting housing, including the homeless, those living in overcrowded conditions, in slums or with their families, the reaction of the so-called caring <Col N="1303" /> Government has been to allow my own local authority in the year before last to build one house.  We got a better response last year when we were allowed to build between 16 to 18 houses.  I hope there will be a slight increase in this number in 1991.</P>
    <P>Health depends on the thickness of one's wallet.  The attempt by the Minister to hoodwink the public into believing that everybody will have free health care is just so much hype.  Another 200,000 people will be coming into the health service which is already over-stretched and cannot provide people with the attention they deserve.  It is all part of the poverty that exists in our community. Poverty is not concerned with social welfare cheating; it is about people trying to lead a decent life and having the right of access to the social services.</P>
    <P>How can children achieve high standards in education if they do not have a decent meal before going to school? Evictions and suicides are on the increase because of the pressures of poverty. People are opting out and giving up.  We must attempt to deal with the elimination of poverty, not the continuation of the dependency mentality.  I am not saying this Minister is the culprit.  Indeed, I have a certain admiration for him.  Successive Governments must bear the blame.</P>
    <P>This Bill was published some months after the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  That programme set out supposed commitments in the area of social welfare.  Many of these are meaningless because the targets would have been reached anyway by 1992.  The figures make a mockery of the promises the Government put forward to deal with the problems of poverty.  There must be a realistic commitment to a minimum payment of £62 or £63 a week, as recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new qualifying rules for old age pensions for people who had mixed insurance and I acknowledge progress in relation to the family income supplement.  Many of the benefits set out in the Bill will not be implemented until <Col N="1304" /> July.  Shortly after the announcement of the budget the moderate increase of 4 per cent was offset by increases in local authority rents.  People in my area received a demand for a 50 per cent increase in local authority rents.  Most of these people are old age pensioners or are unemployed.  The former were asked to pay an extra £1.50 per week.  Increases in gas and electricity charges have also been announced and there is a threatened increase in telephone charges.  The Government are giving with one hand and taking with the other.  They have control over these increases.  Bord Gáis are making huge profits due to the resources off our shores but they have been allowed to pass on VAT increases to the consumer.  Many of their customers in urban areas are poor and elderly.  The allowance which is given to them will not cover the combined increases in electricity and gas charges.  Basically there is no real benefit for the poor.  Ireland is a country where more and more people are becoming marginalised and forgotten.</P>
    <P>The Government are out of touch with reality.  The Minister for the Environment said at a press conference some weeks ago that he intended to set up self-help projects in the housing area.  The statistics show that 70-80 per cent of those on local authority housing lists are social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>The much hackneyed phrase regarding the gap between the haves and the have nots must be repeated because the gap is widening.  I wish to refer to problems in my city which probably occur in most urban areas.  There has been a 5 per cent increase in the number of people in my area drawing unemployment benefit or assistance.  This is a scandalous statistic, behind which lies a litany of human misery, suffering and deprivation.  This has spread from local authority areas to areas which were traditionally regarded as better off or well-heeled.  The hidden poverty in so-called middle class areas where people are under pressure due to unemployment and other factors is increasing.  Deprivation is affecting both young and old.</P>
    <P>Children in my city are coming to <Col N="1305" /> school each morning but finding it impossible to concentrate because of hunger.  But for the generosity, commitment and dedication of the teaching staff who provide hot food, soup and sandwiches, they would leave school hungry and return to homes without food or proper heating.  Deprivation is so deep in some urban areas that teachers provide food and clothing for the children attending their schools.  Some of these children have never spent a day at the seaside and in order to redress that terrible deprivation teachers and voluntary organisations have arranged for them to spend a day or two away.  I pay tribute to those teachers and voluntary organisations. They do not get the recognition they deserve for services in deprived areas.  I know of families in the most disadvantaged areas who have switched their children to schools which provide food each day.  That is a sad comment on a Christian and so-called caring society as we approach the 21st century.  Many of our legislators are so distanced from the reality of deprivation that they do not appreciate that this is happening and they have not the commitment to deal with these basic social problems.</P>
    <P>The deprivation being experienced by young people is very serious.  It means that our young people are not getting the start in life they deserve.  The deprivation and poverty spreads right through our urban and rural areas and these people experience a sense of alienation and shame.  Some people are ashamed of their situation because they are made to feel guilty by comments, such as those with regard to social welfare cheats, that we have heard this evening.  People are made to feel ashamed of being poor.</P>
    <P>There is unemployment of 70 per cent and 80 per cent in parts of our cities.  The long term unemployed feel they are the forgotten people.  The much heralded European development funds and the programmes set up for the development of our infrastructure seem to have bypassed the underprivileged in our society and the areas that most need the injection of funds.  They do not seem to have had the benefical impact they should have had <Col N="1306" /> on areas of widespread unemployment. This has led to a feeling of despair and total neglect.  We are spending these moneys on roads and bridges, improving our infrastructure admittedly but there is no real spin off for the poor.  The development programme seems to pass by the unemployed.</P>
    <P>High unemployment brings about a disimprovement in an area and then becomes unattractive for industrial investment because investors will not invest in an area that is run down.  A run down area is not attractive to investors and unemployment continues.  It is a vicious circle.  Moneys from the development funds will have to be invested to improve these areas and give the people encouragement thus making the area more attractive to investors who are still investing in our country.  That is not being done.  I think there is a blind spot in our development policy.</P>
    <P>A campaign is in progress at present &mdash; I do not know if it is a campaign by the Department or just by individuals &mdash; to harass social welfare recipients.  A good friend of mine, a Deputy from Cork, made a passing reference a few moments ago to social welfare cheats. There are cheats, but people who are unemployed and victims of our society should not be made feel ashamed to be poor.  I am not sure if there is a campaign by the Department to justify the harassment of social welfare recipients.  I am told every day of the week that people are being questioned and then being cut off disability benefit or they are told they are not making any effort to get work.  It is possible that a campaign of harassment is being forced on the Department by the return of emigrants and by the increase in our unemployment figures.  In other words, there is a greater number to share the cake and there must be an attempt to cut down on the numbers to offset the influx into the social welfare system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such campaign in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is evidence of people being harassed on an ongoing basis.  They <Col N="1307" /> are investigated by the Department, and told they are not making an effort to get work when there is evidence they have made valid efforts to get work.  This worries me.  Newspaper headlines, whether inspired by sources within Departments, worry me also.  We had a recent headline on social welfare cheats.  While there are cheats, everybody on social welfare is not a cheat.  The pressure on the social welfare budget as a result of an increasing number of returning emigrants and the increase in unemployment has made the decision makers in the Department more determined to cut back on the number of social welfare payments, to try to balance those coming in with those being cut off. The Minister will probably give us figures to show there has been an increase, but with the number of people returning and the increase in the level of unemployment, the Minister would need to introduce a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some social welfare cheats are being caught under this campaign but many innocent people are suffering losses in payments.  The unemployed feel they are being harassed and branded as potential cheats.  The crack down on social welfare cheats could be a front for a programme of cutbacks in the Department of Social Welfare.  The newspaper article stated that social welfare cheats had been getting off lightly but in the massive new crackdown many moonlighting practices in the black economy were coming under regular examination.  A social welfare official is quoted as saying &ldquo;you will be caught&rdquo;.  Imagine the impact that has on the individual who, through no fault of his own, is unemployed.  He is put in a position of distrust straightaway.  Health and social welfare chiefs have been quoted as saying that official figures for social welfare fraud are just the tip of the iceberg; a figure of £40 million for social welfare fraud a year is being bandied around by officials.  A social welfare official is quoted as saying &ldquo;I am issuing a public warning that anyone in receipt of an allowance, or medical card through a fraudulent claim will be caught.&rdquo;  The article also said that a Government <Col N="1308" /> Deputy &mdash; it was repeated here today &mdash; called for a greater level of prosecution. There should be a greater level of prosecution of cheats but all social welfare recipients should not be under suspicion. What makes me sick is that the amount involved is small compared to the practices in other areas, the white collar banditry, which no Government seem to have the will to bring under control &mdash; the types of incidents we have had in the past 12 months, which involved the recall of the Dáil.  We seem to accept these things but the unfortunate man or woman who is a victim of our economic failure is made to feel a lesser being.  I appeal for more sensitivity.  If there is a campaign to weed out the greedy, let us not make the needy feel they are part of that fraud. This is just a cruel front for the harassment of people in need, and I ask that it be discontinued.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister bear in mind &mdash; I am sure I do not have to lecture him &mdash; that poverty and deprivation are not just about social welfare benefits but the issue of greater investment in education in our socially deprived areas.  A greater emphasis on industrial development is necessary to raise the spirits of those living in deprived areas.  That is not happening. There is too much emphasis on the hand out.  These are needed for the symptoms, but they create dependency and there is a political return on those.  If people feel dependent they will pay back the Government appropriately.  I do not like that system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen identified certain areas which concerns us all.  I was interested in his comments about closures in our cities.  There were a number of closures in our own city that will be remembered for a long time.  I refer to the closure of Dunlops, Fords and the dockyards.  These closures took place at a time when Deputy Allen and his colleagues were on this side of the House and in a position to do something about it.  While I have to acknowledge that there may have been a limit to what could have been done, it was said at the time in relation to one of these companies by <Col N="1309" /> a senior politician, a Minister at the time, that that company would not be allowed to walk away from Cork.  People in Cork say today that they were allowed to walk away.  I acknowledge that only a certain amount can be done by any Government, but I want to put it on the record that I cannot accept people on the Opposition pointing the finger in one direction.</P>
      <P>I have always tried to carry out my role as a public representative in a responsible manner, bearing in mind the effects these things have on people.  I have paid very close attention to the whole area of social welfare.  I live in the heart of my constituency, where there is high unemployment, marital breakdown, where there are single parents and many more problems.  I pay close attention to these areas and I must pay tribute to Deputy Woods, the Minister for Social Welfare. It has been a pleasure to work with him, to discuss matters with him.  Coming himself from a constituency similar to my own, he is very much aware of people's problems.  We are fortunate that he has been in the Department and responsible for those affairs for the last number of years.  The major improvements, the changes for the betterment of the people, particularly the less well off, are the result of his foresight, his interest, his awareness and concern.  These changes are the result of his approach, which is to listen to people.  That is why so much has been achieved in this area.</P>
      <P>Like everybody else, I acknowledge that there is much more to be done.  What has been achieved in the last three years, and which has been acknowledged on all sides of the House &mdash; though hesitantly at times &mdash; is a credit to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have always shown a special concern for our older citizens, for the widows, the unemployed, the disadvantaged and the deprived.  Most of the modern developments in our social welfare system were created by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the Government started a process of systematically giving special increases in social welfare to bring those on the lowest payments up to the priority <Col N="1310" /> levels mentioned by the Social Welfare Commission.  In the early eighties the same Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods gave very substantial increases in social welfare to the elderly.  The major progress made in the early eighties was recognised by the poverty study carried out under the Combat Poverty Agency in 1986 and 1987.</P>
    <P>Their report noted that the elderly were no longer a high risk category. Thanks for that is due to the Minister. Over the past four budgets he has given substantial, real improvements in the level of payments to those who were most at risk.  It should be remembered by the various pressure groups who continue to call for the implementation of the recommendations of various reports, that Fianna Fáil were delivering and continue to deliver on social welfare.</P>
    <P>While the Combat Poverty Agency funded study is very useful and contains a wealth of valuable information, the Minister had already identified the unemployed and lone parents as the groups most in need of extra resources in the late eighties and early nineties just as he had done with the elderly in the early eighties.</P>
    <P>Under the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> our social welfare services will continue to be systematically improved and refined with special concentrations on those who need it most.  We in Fianna Fáil continue to be committed to ensuring that those who must rely on social welfare, especially large families, will share in the benefits to be gained from economic growth.  This Bill concentrates on those on social welfare payments, but we are also helping people at work on low incomes with improvements in the family income supplement scheme and our special approach to tax exemptions for people at work.</P>
    <P>This Bill continues to give effect to our caring philosophy.  The substantial improvements that have taken place have been made against a background of severe economic difficulty.  Over the past few years the Government have concentrated successfully on restoring order to the public finances.  This has meant a <Col N="1311" /> substantial curb on the level of expenditure by the Government.  Despite these tight controls and the need to reduce the level of borrowing, expenditure on social welfare has increased to the extent that we are now spending £3,000 million a year on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>There is a perception among those who criticise the Government for the amount they spend on social welfare or who criticise our system of social welfare, that these payments are in the main going to the unemployed.  The reality is different. The single largest area of expenditure relates to the elderly, who account for a third of total expenditure.  The expenditure on payments to widows and lone parents is similar to that for unemployment payments, each accounting for about 25 per cent of the total expenditure. Illness accounts for about 12 per cent, while the balance is spent on miscellaneous benefits and allowances and on administration.</P>
    <P>Ireland has the lowest inflation rate in the EC at 2.7 per cent and the budget introduced last January is designed to keep inflation down to about 3 per cent. Against that background this Bill provides for a general increase in all rates of 4 per cent.  This means that the value of social welfare payments will be more than maintained in real terms.  The increase exceeds the rate of inflation.  The cost of this increase, which is more than enough to meet the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is £104 million.</P>
    <P>On top of this, special increases are again being provided, for the fourth year in a row, for those on the lowest payments. The personal rates of unemployment assistance (short term) are being increased by over 11 per cent this year.  The special increases for people on unemployment benefit and disability benefit means that all long term social welfare payments now reach or exceed the priority rate of the Social Welfare Commission at 1991 levels.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that there has been an increase of 45 per cent in the level of unemployment payments since <Col N="1312" /> Fianna Fáil returned to Government in 1987.  The real value of that increase can be understood by realising that this huge percentage increase was achieved at a time when inflation was reduced to low single figure inflation for each of those years, having been reduced to less than 3 per cent last year and this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for having given me the opportunity to raise this serious issue on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>A heading in the local newspaper today reads &ldquo;Bunclody Angry at Mounting Crime Wave&rdquo;.  In the past six months there has been a serious escalation of crime in Bunclody town and surrounding areas.  Whereas there were 36 reported burglaries for the full year last year there have been 16 in the first two months of this year, demonstrating that there has been a dramatic increase in this area, that is pertaining to supermarkets, shops, petrol stations, private houses, all hit by individuals or gangs operating in this area.  People are living in fear and old people afraid to open their doors at night because of this problem.</P>
      <P>There was a major robbery in Bunclody last week of antiques worth thousands of pounds; some estimates have been at over £80,000.  Three gardaí working in the area are doing their best but are unable to cope.  For some reason best known to the Department of Justice the sergeant who had been living in Bunclody was transferred some time ago to Gorey.  I would ask the Minister to reappoint a sergeant to Bunclody on a permanent basis.  There is no doubt but that the services of a sergeant are needed there and that there has been a serious crime problem since the departure of the one who had been there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for an increased Garda presence in the Bunclody area, a need for night patrols which could be made possible by bringing in patrol cars from <Col N="1313" /> adjoining areas.  In the past year generally there has been a decrease in crime in County Wexford.  Therefore it should be possible to deploy extra gardaí to counteract the problem being encountered in Bunclody.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider the reappointment of a Garda sergeant to Bunclody, to appoint extra gardaí on a short term basis to deal with this problem and bring in extra patrol cars at night to deal with the position obtaining.  I have no doubt but that this problem can be tackled.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could inform the House whether local gangs or gangs coming in from outside are causing this problem.  Regardless of who the culprits are, it is essential that it be tackled head-on and that the three gardaí at present operating in Bunclody be given the necessary back-up facilities to do so, allowing the people in the area live a normal life and not be subjected to the harassment these burglaries of the past three or four months have caused them.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for making time available to hear my case in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the effect an increase in crime can have on a rural community.  We are fortunate in this country in that the vast majority of our rural communities enjoy a relatively crime-free life by international standards; that is as it should be. I share the determination of the Garda authorities to ensure that our rural communities continue to enjoy that quality of life.</P>
      <P>The Bunclody area is typical of many other rural areas in so far as crime is concerned.  Over the past three years there has been an average of two to three only indictable crimes per month reported to Bunclody station.  The recent increase in the number of burglaries and larcenies in the area is well outside the normal crime pattern for Bunclody and demands a specific response, as has been requested by Deputy Seán Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Browne that the Garda authorities are providing this response by way of special policing <Col N="1314" /> measures to meet the circumstances prevailing. Of course it would not be appropriate for me to go into too much detail on the precise measures being taken by local Garda officers in order to respond to the crime problem being encountered in Bunclody.  However, I can say that, so far, two juveniles have been brought before the courts in respect of ten of the 23 crimes committed in Bunclody this year and a definite line of inquiry is being followed in relation to a number of other offences.  In particular attention is being given by local gardaí to investigation of the burglary on Tuesday last &mdash; to which Deputy Browne referred &mdash; in which valuable antique items were taken.  A special team, comprising two detective gardaí and an extra uniformed garda, have been allocated to Bunclody on a temporary basis to assist the local gardaí in relation to this and other crimes.  I am assured that no effort is being spared in the active pursuit of these investigations. I might mention also that the Bunclody area is receiving priority attention by crime prevention patrols operating from the district headquarters station in Gorey.</P>
    <P>On the question of appointing a Garda sergeant to Bunclody, the position is that the Garda authorities are not at present in a position to assign a full-time sergeant to the town but they have arranged for the sergeant in charge of Gorey to be given responsibility for the supervision of the Bunclody area.  The question of assigning a sergeant to Bunclody is being considered in the light of overall demands on Garda services in the Wexford Garda Division.  In the meantime the Garda authorities consider that the policing needs of the area are being met satisfactorily by the three gardaí assigned to Bunclody and by the temporary assignments I mentioned earlier.  These arrangements will continue to be kept under review.  I will bring Deputy Browne's strong submission here this afternoon to the attention of the Garda Commissioner and will communicate further with him on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for having given me the opportunity to raise this important matter and the Minister for taking the time to listen to what I have to say.  I hope he will be as forthcoming and wholesome in his response as he has been to Deputy Browne in respect of the Bunclody area.</P>
      <P>As spokesperson on justice for The Workers' Party may I place on record my delight at the verdict and release of the Birmingham Six in London today.</P>
      <P>The matter I want to raise in the few moments available to me is one that is precise.  I forwarded its substantive detail by way of letter to the Minister for Justice on 27 February last and welcome this opportunity to pursue the matter further in the House.</P>
      <P>I understand that since 1989 there has been in practice a working diretive from the Garda Commissioner that members on mobile patrol, in cars or on motorbikes, must rely on what is known as the command and control system of centralised communication at Garda Headquarters using the radio system in or on their vehicles.  The walkie-talkie radio we have observed so many gardaí use on our streets is not available to them while on mobile patrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would never wish to endeavour to tell the Garda how they should do their work on a day-to-day basis; by and large they do an excellent job.  But because this issue has been raised with me by a number of their members in Dublin I feel it incumbent on me to pursue it with the Minister and seek explanation.  The walkie-talkies have been paid for out of taxpayers' money and are available in sufficient numbers to enable gardaí use them when on active service on mobile patrol.  I understand a decision has been taken &mdash; though I am open to correction on this &mdash; that the management side of the Garda authorities are anxious to have all calls and monitoring of the work of their members centralised through the central command and control system and, thereby automatically logged on their central computer so that in time <Col N="1316" /> they will be able to monitor even more affectively what any individual member does while on mobile patrol.  Nonetheless this practice denies a member a very useful and worthwhile piece of equipment.</P>
    <P>In practice what happens is that a communication from an individual member to his or her station or other associate in the area must be directed by means of the radio system into the central command, then relayed on to the relevant police station who, in turn, relay the call or message to the other member seeking to be contacted if it is an onward call.  That system can only operate in each of the main district areas in Dublin on one channel each.  Consequently, if the channel is busy the member must wait in queue until a channel is free when they can make their call onward.  That denies the opportunity of cross contact between members, one to one, avoiding this circuitous route through the central command and the police station.  It denies the very useful operation of a member in a local area making direct contact with another member by using the walkie-talkie or denies the opportunity to the member of making direct contact with the garda station from which he or she operates in a co-ordinated way.</P>
    <P>It seems an unnecessarily convoluted way of dealing with matters.  I can understand fully the administrative and organisational basis on which the Commissioner is anxious that all matters be logged and recorded through the central system.  However, I am advised that where the walkie-talkie is used on a one-to-one basis to the station from the member directly the officer in charge of the station can proceed to have those calls logged at an off-peak period into the central command and control system, thereby maintaining this comprehensive record of what goes on.  That, succinctly, is the issue.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the members who work on those patrols I am asking the Minister to approach the Commissioner to have this matter reviewed.  An issue which is a cause of worry and irritation to the <Col N="1317" /> members should be reviewed and the status quo ante-1989 restored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be delighted with the news of the release of the Birmingham Six.  While a Government statement has been issued in relation to it I take the opportunity, as Minister for Justice, to welcome the long delayed release of these innocent men. We are all, as a nation, delighted to see them released.</P>
      <P>The issue before the House to which the Deputy has referred, is the practice whereby crews in patrol cars carried a personal radio which was linked to their station in addition to the car radio which was linked to the central control room. This practice was discontinued by Garda management because it provided a second means of control over garda cars which is considered by them to be neither necessary nor desirable.</P>
      <P>The Garda command and control system in the Dublin Metropolitan area is designed in accordance with the wishes of Garda management to provide that each Garda unit is controlled from one source only and it thus ensures that the possibility of contradictory instructions from different sources does not arise.  The new command and control system is in operation in the Dublin Metropolitan area since 1989 and gives the gardaí vastly improved communications facilities. These include much faster access for car crews to the central control room through the additional channels which are being provided and a facility to enable car crews to speak directly to one another.  This latter facility is activated at the central control room when control room staff consider that its use is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these facilities the observer in a patrol car is provided with a walkie-talkie which enables him to keep in contact with the car driver when he leaves the vehicle.  This ensures that the patrol car crew are always in radio contact. The system therefore, provides control over Garda resources as required by Garda management and at the same time <Col N="1318" /> allows for flexibility, such as direct contact between car crews in particular instances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you a Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity of raising this important matter on the Adjournment.  I wish to concur with the statements of the Minister for Justice, and Deputy McCartan, on the release of the Birmingham Six.  It was a joyous occasion for us all to watch the emotional scenes outside the Old Bailey this last hour.  We wish them every happiness on their release.</P>
      <P>St. Columba's Comprehensive School is situated in Glenties, County Donegal, with an enrolment of 450 pupils.  It serves the Glenties, Ardara, Portnoo, Maas areas and would be considered one of the most rural and scattered catchment areas in the country.  However, the enrolment is healthy and is expected to increase over the next few years.  The school has an excellent record of academic achievement throughout the area and is staffed by a dedicated corps of committed teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From next Wednesday, 20 March, industrial action is being taken by the staff due to the failure to resolve a long-running dispute with the Department of Education over their refusal to sanction permanent teaching posts in the school. Last May two permanent whole-time teaching posts were nationally advertised for Glenties.  Two teachers who replied were consequently appointed by the board of management of the school.  They left permanent positions elsewhere to come to Glenties.  However, the Department of Education refused to sanction the positions as advertised, advising that they be filled in a temporary whole-time capacity, that is, on a year to year basis. The two newly appointed teachers, who left permanent positions elsewhere, now find themselves with no permanency or <Col N="1319" /> security of tenure in St. Columba's Comprehensive School, Glenties.  I understand the board of management appealed the Department's decision but without success.</P>
    <P>Since 1985 the Department have been refusing to sanction permanent posts in the school.  The Department claim that all such appointments must await the introduction of a redeployment scheme for community and comprehensive schools in the country.  Despite this claim the Department have, I understand, sanctioned permanent posts in other such schools, for example, Bishopstown Community School, Cork; Tarbert Comprehensive School, Kerry; Shannon Community School, Clare and a few others.  It seems that they have been treated more favourably than Glenties who have been subjected to the full rigours of the embargo.  In addition while the redeployment scheme for secondary schools was being negotiated permanent positions in secondary schools were also, I understand, sanctioned by the Department.</P>
    <P>The TUI have co-operated with the Department of Education on the issue of a redeployment scheme for community and comprehensive schools.  In 1989, at the request of the Department, the TUI met with the ASTI and the management board for these schools, namely, the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, and agreed a draft redeployment scheme.  This was presented to the Department late in 1989. The Department undertook to respond to these proposals at a meeting in December 1989.  That meeting was deferred, was never rescheduled and to date the Department have not responded to proposals. In this context it is unacceptable that the comprehensive schools in Glenties and, indeed, all other community and comprehensive schools, be refused sanction for permanent posts which are justified by enrolment.</P>
    <P>The two posts in Glenties were previously held by permanent teachers &mdash; one up to 1985 when the teacher resigned, the second arose because of the death of <Col N="1320" /> a teacher.  The teachers who now hold these posts resigned permanent posts on the understanding that the posts in Glenties would be permanent.  The board of management of the school has been backing the claim of the TUI and teachers to have these posts made permanent.  A public meeting was held in Glenties last Tuesday &mdash; 12 March &mdash; where overwhelming support was expressed for the teachers and their campaign by the parents and the entire community.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister, and the Minister of State &mdash; I appreciate his coming in here this evening &mdash; to immediately recognise the permanency of the appointed teachers so as to avoid a strike that could have serious consequences for the pupils of Glenties, particularly those who are preparing for examinations.  The patience of the union and teachers is exhausted at this stage after many years of procrastination and fruitless efforts to find an agreeable solution to this long-running dispute with the Department who are obstinate in the extreme.</P>
    <P>My final appeal to the Minister, and the Minister of State, who is in the Chamber this evening, is to act now so that the classrooms of St. Columba's Comprehensive School, Glenties, will be open to the 450 pupils when they arrive at the school next Wednesday morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this matter as it affords me an opportunity to clarify my Department's position in regard to the teaching staff in the school.  I am, of course, aware of the threatened strike action in St. Columba's comprehensive school and naturally I am concerned at the impact such action would have on the education of the pupils attending the school, particularly those in examination classes.  I would appeal to those contemplating strike action to consider this issue also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the teaching allocation in the school, in June 1990 my Department authorised, on an ex-quota basis, a principal and remedial teacher as well as other posts based on the PTR and the continuance from the previous year of a <Col N="1321" /> special concession of 0.5 to enable the school to continue to employ a religion teacher on a part-time basis.  I am also happy to state that the school was allocated an additional post under the terms of my Department's circular letter 27/90 in respect of disadvantaged children and that the school was allowed to make an additional permanent whole-time appointment to that post.</P>
    <P>The total authorised teacher allocation to the school for the current year, including the 0.5 part-time religion teacher to whom I have referred, is 26.4 whole-time teachers.  There are 24 permanent teachers currently employed and serving in the school, apart from the two whole-time teachers whose appointments are at the centre of this dispute.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the position which obtains in relation to the making of permanent teacher appointments by boards of management of community and comprehensive schools.  The general position is that pending the introduction of a redeployment scheme for surpus teachers my Department as a general rule are not sanctioning the appointment of teachers in a permanent capacity.  This policy has been notified and made very clear to the boards of management of all schools and has been included in the annual teacher allocation letter from my Department.  It has also been pointed out in writing to the boards of management that should they wish to make a permanent appointment the matter should be submitted to me and my sanction obtained before taking any step towards making the proposed appointment.</P>
    <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the board of St. Columba's school went ahead with their advertising and selection arrangements and then submitted two teacher appointments, one for religion and the other for physics and mathematics, to my Department last July and requested that they be sanctioned in a permanent capacity as and from the beginning of the 1990-91 school year.  My Department responded that they were not in a position to sanction the teachers' appointments in a permanent capacity <Col N="1322" /> but that they would be prepared to consider favourable proposals by the board to appoint them in a temporary capacity for the 1990-91 school year.  The board have continued to press for the teachers' appointments to be sanctioned in a permanent capacity.</P>
    <P>The general direction of the educational programme in a community or comprehensive school is, of course, a matter for the board subject to compliance with my Department's regulations in the matter of approved teacher resources.  In this context I should like to point out that I am aware the restrictions on permanent appointments in this sector have created difficulties for some schools and I am prepared to examine the issue to see if we can resolve those difficulties.</P>

      <P>At this month's meeting of Dublin City Council I asked the City Manager to report the view of the Chief Fire Officer on a matter of recent public controversy &mdash; the inability of the fire services turntable ladder to gain entry to the main courtyard in Government Buildings, Merrion Street, Dublin 2.  I also asked about the fire officer's view as to whether this lack of access would present any problem for the safety of persons in Government Buildings in the event of an outbreak of fire and whether it would create any problem for firefighters. The City Manager replied that the Chief Fire Officer had reported that while the firefighting water tenders gained access to the main courtyard in the recent exercise at Government Buildings, Merrion Street, the turntable ladder was unable to gain entry.  He said that he considered it desirable that the entrance to the courtyard should be capable of admitting a turntable ladder and had so advised the chairman of the Commissioners of <Col N="1323" /> Public Works.  He said that the chairman had replied that he was having the matter examined and would advise him shortly. The City Manager went on to say that the fire officer had stated that access by turntable ladder could affect the efficiency of firefighting operations.  In view of the very definite concerns clearly expressed by the Chief Fire Officer I am hopeful that the Minister will ensure that the necessary arrangements are made to facilitate access by the turntable ladder. I am sure the Minister will agree that in the interests of fire safety generally it is essential that the Government are seen to set a good example.  People expect the highest standards to be maintained in Government Buildings.  I trust the Minister's reply will bring this controversy to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <P>I understand that the report was made by the Deputy Chief Fire Officer.  I already addressed the House on this matter in the Adjournment Debate on 12 February last.  I note that the Deputy has put down a parliamentary question for answer after <Col N="1324" /> the Easter Recess.  A press statement was also issued on 6 February last and I can only reiterate what it contained &mdash; the standards of fire safety for Government Buildings are set by the proposed buildings regulations, 1983.  While these are not statutory provisions, the Office of Public Works abide by them.  Given the depth of interest in the matter I am happy to give further details of the facilities which have been provided.</P>
      <P>The building has to be looked at in its totality.  One hundred per cent of its outer perimeter is accessible by turntable ladder which is more than what is required under the proposed building regulations.  Additional fire hydrants have been provided to serve all areas. Dry risers have been provided throughout for firefighting at each floor level and fireman's lifts and staircases have been provided in the refurbished area for firefighting at each floor level and at roof level.  I should also like to add that the provision of fire fighting equipment and safety measures are kept under constant review by the commissioner's staff.</P>

      <P>Almost 60 per cent of the recommendations of the <i>Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces</i> are already effective.  The bulk of these are concerned with pay and allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining recommendations which are quite complex relate, for example, to organisation; manpower and personnel policy; certain conditions of service; superannuation.  The time-scale for their implementation is dependent on the complexity of the issues and on the <Col N="1261" /> consultative process with the elected representatives of the various military ranks.</P>
    <P>Civil and military personnel of my Department meet regularly with the elected representatives to discuss, plan and monitor the ongoing implementation of the remaining recommendations of the Gleeson report.</P>

      <P>My Department are in the process of acquiring a 15 acre site of reclaimed foreshore in State ownership at Ringaskiddy, County Cork to provide training facilities for the Naval Service.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer submitted a claim for a refund of tax on 15 February 1991.  This was certified for repayment on 19 February and a cheque for £90.47 issued to him on 26 February 1991.  The inspector of taxes has no other application on hand for a repayment of tax.</P>

      <P>To be eligible for repayment, a person's disablement must conform to the medical criteria specified in the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, and must be certified accordingly by the director of community care and medical officer of health (DCC) in the relevant health board area.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the medical certificate furnished in this case did not certify that the applicant's disablement conformed to one of the eligible criteria.  The Revenue Commissioners sought clarification from the DCC in July 1990 and again in February 1991 but have received no reply.  In the circumstances eligibility for refund on medical grounds has not been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, are currently under review.  The medical criteria will be reconsidered as part of that review.  As has been previously indicated <Col N="1270" /> in the House, the Opposition spokespersons will be consulted as part of the review.</P>

      <P>The main tax concession in the Shannon Customs Free Airport zone which is not available in Ringaskiddy is the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for certain qualifying trading operations. The Ringaskiddy Freeport Advisory Committee have made representations asking if a similar tax regime could be secured for the freeport.  I met representatives of the committee and explained the position to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> Like Shannon, Ringaskiddy also has a range of VAT concessions, most particularly the facility to import goods into the free zone without payment of VAT at point of entry.  The main VAT concession that was not extended to Ringaskiddy was the facility which allows domestic traders from outside the zone to supply goods at the zero rate into the zone.  this decision was taken in accordance with the general policy of non-extension of VAT zero-rating.</P>
    <P>Attracting industry to locate in Ringaskiddy is the responsibility of the IDA and Cork Harbour Commissioners.  The Cork Harbour Commissioners market the portal facilities for the normal trade and traffic activities of the ferry and deep-water terminals and the IDA have primary responsibility for the attraction of port related industries to the freeport.  I am informed that Ringaskiddy Freeport is being vigorously promoted and marketed. This is evidenced by the fact that in 1989-90 site visits to Ringaskiddy were undertaken by a total of 65 companies. Regrettably, to date there are only four companies and one subsidiary company operating in the freeport.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the appalling increase in the number of robberies in houses and motor vehicles, together with an increase in vandalism, in the Ballybrack area of County Dublin; if he will arrange, as a matter of urgency, to provide additional gardaí for the area together with the necessary resources for them to carry out their job properly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of indictable crimes reported in the Ballybrack area in 1990 decreased by about 21 per cent as compared with 1989.  Burglaries and larcenies decreased by over 15 per cent and 31 per cent respectively and there was no increase in robberies or incidents of malicious <Col N="1280" /> damage.  Figures for the first two months of this year are not available, but it appears that there may have been some increase as compared with the corresponding period last year.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities assure me that the necessary resources will continue to be allocated to the Shankill subdistrict, which includes Ballybrack, for the prevention of crime in this area.  I am informed that the current Garda strength in Shankill is 42, which represents an increase of 11 since 1989.  The question of assigning additional manpower there will be kept under review as additional manpower becomes available and having regard to the many other demands on Garda services in the Dublin Metropolitan Area that must be met.</P>
      <P>The community policing scheme in Ballybrack has recently been augmented by the appointment of a second garda to community policing duties in the area. There is also, I am glad to say, a very effective neighbourhood watch scheme in operation there and a high degree of co-operation is maintained between representatives of the scheme and the local gardaí.</P>

      <P>Ireland acceded to the 1951 United Nations (Geneva) Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and to the 1967 (New York) Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees on 29 November 1956 and 6 November 1968, respectively. Accordingly, Ireland is bound under international law to fulfil all the obligations and duties arising under and by virtue of the convention and protocol and legislation is not required to implement their provisions.  The procedures used in implementing these provisions have been <Col N="1281" /> agreed between my Department and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and are as outlined by me in my reply of 14 June 1990 to a number of parliamentary questions regarding asylum seekers &mdash; column 2556 of the Official Report.</P>

      <Quest>if, in his five year framework of action for health promotion, he will consider promoting (1) more local home grown foods, ideally through organic methods such as oats, barley, wheat and green vegetables and (2) a reduction in imported citrus and tropical fruits, particularly from developing countries, such as pineapple, kiwi fruits, bananas and rice as this will help Irish farmers in distributing their foods locally and give a recommended diet of more warming, high mineral content and low sugar foods; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The key objectives of the five year action framework on nutrition health promotion, which I will launch shortly, are based on the Healthy Eating Guidelines formulated by the former Food Advisory Committee and disseminated by my Department's Health Promotion Unit. The two principal objectives are that the Irish diet should, first, be varied so that the necessary nutrients are consumed, and consumed in balanced amounts, and secondly, should also provide energy consistent with the maintenance of appropriate body weight.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has an international reputation as a high-quality food producing country involving the agricultural, marine and horticultural sectors in particular.  The implementation of a health promotion programme on nutrition will rely heavily, though not exclusively, on the availability of nutritious food produced at home.  In order to achieve the objectives of the action framework, it will be important to network with Irish food industry groups to ensure the availability of a wide range of home produced foods.  The promotion of their consumption will also be important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's proposal on <Col N="1285" /> the reduction of imports of certain fruits and cereals, the Deputy will be aware that this proposal goes beyond my area of responsibility as Minister for Health. Indeed, it is precisely because many issues in health promotion, such as nutrition, involve the co-operation of Departments other than Health that a Cabinet subcommittee on health promotion was established.  The subcommittee, as the Deputy is probably aware, is chaired by myself and is composed of the Ministers for Agriculture, Education, Energy, Environment and Labour.  The rationale for the committee is to provide an effective mechanism whereby decision making in areas of public policy, including food and nutrition policy, can be informed by a health perspective.</P>
    <P>The healthy eating guidelines recommend that a regular diet should be based on a wide and varied range of foodstuffs to ensure a balanced intake of all essential nutrients, including vitamins and minerals. The reduction of the availability of the foods referred to by the Deputy would not be consistent with the need to have available a wide and varied range of foods, particularly fruit and cereals, especially as such foods are generally available and consumed at present.</P>
    <P>The action framework will encompass the promotion of foods low in sugar and a reduction in the frequency of the consumption of sugary foods in the Irish diet, particularly by children and adults who are overweight.  Foods rich in minerals and vitamins will also be promoted.</P>

There are 390 patients on the waiting list for orthopaedic surgery at the hospital at present.  This represents an improvement of 22 per cent on the figure for July 1989.</P>
