    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1991: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The continued commitment of the Government and the Minister to the less well off is very clear in the Bill.  The fact that we have had eight new Acts &mdash; and that there are 64 sections in this Bill &mdash; is a very clear recognition of the Government's continued concern for the less well off in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to the major increases over the past three years.  The special increases for people on unemployment and disability benefit mean that all long term social welfare payments reach &mdash; or exceed &mdash; the priority rate <Col N="1447" /> of the Commission on Social Welfare at 1991 levels.  I again want to emphasise that there has been an increase of 45 per cent in the level of unemployment payments since Fianna Fáil returned to Government in 1987.  The real value of that increase can be appreciated by realising that this huge percentage increase was achieved at a time when inflation was reduced to a low single figure for each of those years, indeed, it was reduced to less than 3 per cent last year and remains at that figure this year.  The personal rate has increased from £38 to £55, which is real progress against an extremely difficult economic background.  The Fine Gael-Labour Coalition of the mid-eighties did not take on the task of improving the position of people on social welfare. Their approach was to set the problem aside for a few years by establishing a commission to examine the needs of the people.  However, Fianna Fáil had already identified the requirements of the people in relation to social welfare and we had started a process, when Deputy Woods was Minister for Social Welfare, in the early eighties which continued, as I said, over the past three years.</P>
    <P>While the Government can do much to provide welfare services, there is always a need for voluntary bodies and organisations. I want to pay tribute to the Minister for setting aside £1 million this year to assist voluntary organisations; £500,000 has been made available to women's groups.  At the beginning of last year the Minister recognised the need for support and assistance for the many voluntary groups which represented women's organisations through out the country.  My constituency of Cork North-Central &mdash; and areas such as Farranree, Knocknaheeny, Mayfield and many others &mdash; have benefited in a very substantial way from these grants.  Many organised women's groups now participate at local level; the husbands of many of these women are unemployed, the women are caring for young children and, until they joined these groups, they had no outlets or hope for the future. They are now coming together and the <Col N="1448" /> Minister's assistance is very welcome. The support groups in Knocknaheeny and Mayfield have benefited from those grants, it has given men who have been unemployed for many years an opportunity to come together and to support one another in projects in their local areas.  I should particularly like to refer to the once-off capital grants which have been allocated to areas all over the country.  I can say without hesitation that the sum of £1 million was value for money; £300,000 has been allocated for capital works and community associations and facilities for the elderly have benefited in a very substantial way.</P>
    <P>I agree with the remarks of Deputy Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i> last Thursday in regard to medical referees because it is an area which has caused concern. The vast majority of people in receipt of social welfare are entitled to it.  Unfortunately, many people attending hospitals, consultants and specialists are called before medical referees and told that they are capable of work.  I have personally met people whose GP refused to sign medical certificates classing them as fit to resume work.  Some of them are attending specialists; it is a catch-22 situation and very unsatisfactory.  When people have been certified as unfit for work by a consultant or specialist there should be another system of referral instead of calling them before a medical referee.  They should be referred to a hospital consultant; anything would be better than the present method of deciding. I heard of two cases in the past couple of months where people were waiting to get into hospital and yet the medical referee told them they were fit for work. They duly went into hospital and were in receipt of social welfare but when they left hospital benefit was cut off until they went before a medical referee.  This is very unsatisfactory; I know that the new appeals system is working well but there is still a problem in this category.</P>
    <P>I should also like to acknowledge the allowances given to widowers with dependants and the allowance should continue when the dependants get married or leave home.  It is a fine scheme. <Col N="1449" /> This is the first time it has been recognised that widowers have the same problems and difficulties as widows.  Until the present Minister took on board the decision to give allowances to widowers, they had no assistance from the State other than unemployment benefit or whatever other allowances they were entitled to.  Widowers with no dependants feel they are being hard done by in this legislation, and maybe in future the Minister will consider this category.</P>
    <P>A major breakthrough has been made in the provision for <i>pro rata</i> pensions.  In Cork a group of blue collar CIE workers who became white collar workers found they were losing out because they had not sufficient contributions for full benefit. The Minister's provision in this regard is very welcome and those workers appreciate it.  For years a lobby were pressing for this, uncertain that they would succeed.  Now these workers will be brought into the contribution scheme and this will be taken into consideration when deciding their pensions.  The Minister has taken a major step forward in ensuring part-time workers will be protected. Now 21,000 of them who are being brought into the social welfare system will be eligible for these benefits.</P>
    <P>The decision to allow a minimum of £5 to all people on unemployment assistance who have means assessed against them because of other income into their home is welcome.  No matter what criticism comes from across the floor, the fact is major changes are taking place here for the first time.  This Minister has taken certain matters on board and we see the evidence of that now.  However, no individual should have to depend on the income of his father or brother.  While I welcome the £5 allowance I realise there can be major problems in a family because fathers are unwilling to maintain their sons and daughters.  Young people are leaving home and going into flats to get the rent allowance from the health boards.  We will have to go a long way to accommodate these people.  The correct measures in this area should benefit society in the long term and they also should benefit the finances of the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> The increase in the FIS is very welcome. The Minister showed great foresight when he introduced it.  I know families where the bread-winner would not be working today but for the FIS and these people would get more on social welfare if they were not working.  There are self-employed people all over the country now, for instance, taxi drivers or part-timers who get a certain amount of unemployment assistance.  The Minister might consider extending the FIS to cover these people, thereby taking them off the register.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 52 linking the periods in unemployment assistance claims.  I am sure we have all met people who claim they have worked for a few weeks or months in the year and then find they are no longer classed as long term unemployed &mdash; although they have not worked full-time for five or six years &mdash; and lose their fuel allowance and the double week at Christmas.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is a major problem today and there is no prospect of reducing it to tolerable levels in the immediate future.  The Government must approach this problem in a co-ordinated way.  Many parts of the country, including Knocknaheeny, Gurranebraher, the Glen, Mayfield and Farranree where I live are suffering from very high levels of unemployment. Many of these people are in despair, devoid of hope for themselves and their children.</P>
    <P>The Government have a responsibility to tackle this problem resolutely.  It is sufficiently serious to warrant a Minister with special responsibility for employment. We need a special co-ordinated effort at Government level to restore confidence and hope to the vast numbers who are out of work.  A Minister with special responsibility for this area would be able to co-ordinate the activities to the various Government Departments, semi-State bodies and voluntary agencies who provide services for the unemployed.  While we have achieved a great deal and there is a commitment to job creation, there is clear evidence of the need for co-ordination by the <Col N="1451" /> Government in this regard.  I ask the Minister and his colleagues to consider what I am saying.  Job creation in Ireland is lower than in any other EC country, yet our population is the only one of the Twelve that is set to increase over the coming years.  In the areas of labour, education, social welfare and health tremendous work is being done, but a co-ordinated approach is very necessary.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Woods.  He has taken on board the serious problems of the underprivileged. In the early eighties when he was Minister for Health and Social Welfare he was to the fore in ensuring that the most vulnerable in our society were always thought of, and the record is there to prove that. This legislation, with 64 sections, is clear evidence of his commitment and the support he is getting at Government level to tackle a very serious problem.  I have no doubt that with his continued concern the less well off will continue to receive the benefits to which they are entitled.  Even with all the economic constraints, the fact that we are spending over £3 billion on social welfare gives an indication of the magnitude of his commitment.</P>
    <P>We are a caring society, a caring Government and the evidence is very clear in this Bill.  I am not suggesting that we do not have problems; we have, and, I am aware of this more than any other Deputy because I come from the area in Cork which is identified as a black spot.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I compliment the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal before us is to spend £3 billion in 1991.  The time seems to be shorter than usual to debate and deal with a measure which proposes to cater for about one million people who are living below the poverty line. This measure is suggested to deal with that problem.  It surprises me that such a short time is being given to dealing with an amount of money so great and an issue so complex.</P>

    <P>The issue before us is, how best to <Col N="1452" /> ensure that there is a fair distribution of the moneys and resources available. There is a massive budget at the Minister's disposal.  Indeed, that budget has increased annually for a considerable period, but the problem to be addressed gets worse every year.  At the end of 1991, on the admission of the Minister for Finance, there will be more poor people in Ireland than there were at the beginning of the year, more unemployed people, more single parents and more pensioners, and we will have spent £3 billion and achieved zero as far as the elimination of poverty is concerned.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about the poor we are not talking about something like a satellite in isolation from our society but about human beings, fellow Christians who are forced into a demeaning existence, the victims of demoralising systems of means testing in buildings which symbolise our society's attitude to people who are not well off.  They are subjected to gross invasions of privacy.  I witnessed people signing on for the dole whose hands were publicly examined by the inspectors &mdash; because the system says that if they are not idle they are not entitled to payment.  The inspector had to ensure that they were idle.</P>
    <P>At the end of the year we will still have a system where men and women are in enforced idleness as one of the conditions of payment, where they will be told that they must actively seek work and where the nonsense of getting numbers of letters from employers who have no vacancies will continue.  In relation to people who are permanently ill &mdash; and this was referred to by a Government speaker &mdash; we have the farce of tormenting, repetitive examinations.  I have known cases similar to that about which the Government Deputy spoke where people have been cut off benefit while waiting for a heart operation, the inspector having said that they were fit for work.  All the inspector did was look at them.  Many heart patients look quite healthy, but more than looking is required in such circumstances. The Minister should not ask for details of a specific case and say that <Col N="1453" /> he will deal with it.  I have given the Department details of the case.  It is nearly impossible to get results in such cases because a medical referee seems to think he is obliged to support his predecessor in the matter no matter how wrong his predecessor was.</P>
    <P>We are continuing a system, and spending £3 billion, that will force people out of their homes.  A Government Deputy referred to this as well, so it is a well-recognised problem.  We are means testing people against the income of others.  I will give an example of a homeless couple whose caravan burned down and they moved in with relatives who had a farm.  They were immediately means tested against the relatives' income and their dole was cut off.  The relatives had to put them out because they could not pay for their food.  That sort of stupidity goes on all the time.  The system instructs inspectors to do this sort of thing and it is wrong.  The most usual cases relate to people between 18 and 25 who are forced out of the family home because there is no recognition of the reality of present day society where if one cannot pay one's way at home one does not stay at home. The norm nowadays is that one either pays up or gets out.  Large numbers of young people have been forced to get out into flats in some instances where the health board have to pay a subsidy for the rent, and the Government have to pay full unemployment assistance rates. That should be changed and the Bill before us does not propose to do so.</P>
    <P>Most people are anxious to work, to contribute to society and to be useful members of society.  We deny large numbers of people an opportunity to participate in society.  This Bill and previous legislation treat people as being near criminals, who are guilty until they can prove themselves innocent without the benefit of any help.  Those of us who know a little about the social welfare system realise that it is extremely complex and that many of the people drawing benefits and assistance are illiterate.  We have figures from the Department of Education to show the numbers of people <Col N="1454" /> in that category.  As a public representative I deal with the victims of the system, a constant stream of people who are abused by our social welfare system. I do not suggest that the Minister is not a caring person.  The Minister has repeatedly demonstrated that he is and that he is attempting to make some changes.  I do not suggest that the officers or the employees of the Department of Social Welfare are not caring people, but the system instructs them on how to act.  The system we operate is wrong.</P>
    <P>In my experience, large numbers of people cannot get what they are entitled to because they do not know how to go about it.  The regular cry from the Department and the Minister is about measures to combat fraud, not measures to ensure that everyone gets his entitlements. Measures to combat fraud make it harder for the vast majority of honest people who require welfare payments to get their entitlements.  Any fraud that exists is dwarfed by the amount of money saved in the Department which is not dispensed to people who are entitled to it.  Like other Deputies I have a very busy clinic, and the bulk of the people that come to me are people who cannot get what they are entitled to.  I am very busy dealing with the director and others in the Department of Social Welfare to get them their rights.  I should not have to go to the director.  People should be able to get their entitlements without coming to me, but they cannot get them without coming to me or somebody like me. There are huge savings in the Department arising from that lack of information to people with entitlements.  The rules are constantly changed and they are not explained.  Ministerial orders changing the rules are made not necessarily in the House, and that makes the system more complex and makes it more difficult for people to get their rights.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that there is no fraud in the system.  In some areas organised fraud is rampant.  Ruthless employers tell prospective employees that they will not be given a job unless they keep signing on.  Everybody knows about this.  It is widespread in areas of the <Col N="1455" /> public sector which have been privatised. Forestry is a prime example.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had some success in combating abuses in this area which have been highlighted.  It is well known that the contractors who have taken over in the State forests are operating scams of all sorts.  The Minister should concentrate his efforts on catching them.  In the newly privatised refuse service which has been taken over from the local authorities at least two-thirds of the operatives are not registered by their employers.  The new proposals for Bord na Móna are a charter for this type of abuse.  It cannot be said that our tourism industry is clean in this matter.  Is every casual waitress or lounge boy registered?  Is every temporary barman registered?  We know, as do the Minister and the inspectors, that they are not on the books.  The employees are not to blame.  If they complain they are shown the door.  They are not organised in trade unions and they are thrown out on the street.</P>
    <P>I have no inspectorate and I am aware of the problem.  I see it all around me and, occasionally, I report specific cases to the Department.  In the village where I live there was a case of a builder who would not legitimately employ anybody on a council scheme.  I had to raise the matter at a public meeting of the county council before the Department acted. There was a similar case in my area involving a very plush project where it will cost a lot of money to play golf when it is finished.  Local people were told that if they wanted jobs they had to stay on the dole.  They did not get the jobs and people were bussed from elsewhere who were prepared to keep signing on.  I have no inspectorate but I am aware of these cases.  I meet the victims of this fraud, young workers who when they are let go have no rights.  Those rights have been removed by unscrupulous and ruthless employers.  The Minister has an inspectorate. Why does he not act decisively in the areas which the dogs in the street are barking about, never mind politicians and inspectors in the Department of Social <Col N="1456" /> Welfare?  I am asking the Minister to end the charter for the gombeen men.</P>
    <P>The present system has failed to do the essential job of eliminating poverty. Despite the spending of £3 billion per year, there are one million people below the poverty line.  People are debased, dehumanised and degraded by that system.  The poverty line has been set out by the Commission on Social Welfare who say that a minimum adequate payment is required.  That does not give anybody any luxuries.  It is basically enough for food, clothing and shelter.  All the recipients of social welfare are below that level because the system has failed to provide even a minimum adequate level of payment.  According to the NESC report, families and children in one third of households are below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>It is time for a new look at the system. People should have rights rather than privileges and those rights should have a full statutory basis, as opposed to the temporary conditional means-tested privileges which can be withdrawn at the whim of the Minister or the Department. Rights give dignity, self-confidence and status to people.  Annual increments in a failed and expensive system simply create new poverty traps and continue the degradation of all involved, including the people who have to operate the system.</P>
    <P>A system of universal payments should now be seriously examined.  It is not a new or unique concept and it is in operation in some areas.  For example, child benefit is payable to everybody.  The children of such public figures as Michael Smurfit would be entitled to payment in the same way as the children of the poorest person in the land.  National schools are funded by the State and are available to rich and poor alike.  In other countries every adult gets a universal housing benefit.  There are many varieties of such systems and there can be many stages in their introduction. A system of this kind would begin to rectify the anomalies.  It would begin to remove the poverty traps, give universal rights rather than privileges which can be removed and begin to restore human dignity.  A basic universal income would bury the last remnants of <Col N="1457" /> the poor law system, end the exploitation of cheap labour, mainly by women and young people, and end forever the hated and loathed means-tested system and the gross invasions of privacy involved.  It would end the dependency status, mostly of women, and give equal rights to women thereby.  Women are the main sufferers of the dependency status.  It would certainly end the snoopers' charter in regard to couples who are living together and stop the intolerable invasion of their privacy which is proposed and strengthened in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A system of basic universal income would establish a connection, a common interest, between the haves, the have nots, and the have lots in society.  The strength of the rich would then be on the side of the poor.  No Government can touch the child benefit system because all sectors of society have a common interest in maintaining it.  I notice a new question on the application forms for child benefit. The applicant is asked to provide the PRSI number of the spouse.  Why would the Minister or the Department want that information?  There is only one reason &mdash; he is planning to tax child benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, who operate a system of collective responsibility, want to collect this information for some reason.  I will be proposing at a later stage that child benefit be doubled and taxed and that other allowances such as the FIS which do not reach their targets be abolished.  Social welfare payments, child benefit, tax exemptions and family income supplement should be amalgamated into one single standard payment for all.  We should direct that money to where it is needed through the tax system.  That would be a much better use of the resources available than at present. I am complaining about the present use of resources and I will give an example, £800 million was given in tax reliefs to the PAYE sector in recent years and it was hailed as a great reform.  Where did <Col N="1458" /> the money go?  Most of it went to people who were already well off.  It did not do anything to alleviate poverty.  Of course, some of it trickled down to the large numbers at the bottom as well.  That is a bad use of resources.  It would take £300 million &mdash; about one-third of what had been given in tax relief &mdash; to increase child benefit to £16 per week for all children and to give children over 12 years of age an extra £6, if we used the clawback system to take money from the well off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  I am arguing for an infinitely better use of our limited resources.  It is by using a combination of social welfare and taxation measures that we will be able to direct the resources we have to where they are most needed.</P>
      <P>There will be arguments against the concept of a basic income.  People who oppose the idea of a basic income argue that workers are lazy.  What never ceases to amaze me are the double standards in our society on this issue.  The argument is put forward that we must punish workers to make them work, and the best way of punishing them is, of course, to reduce their income.  I am surprised that the Minister makes that type of argument in his speech.  He demonstrates quite clearly that a person would be a lot worse off on social welfare than working.  He was very selective in the cases he picked out, although I am not saying he should not have been trying to make the best case possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The case was made in the media recently and I was referring to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  The theory is that workers must be punished to make them work but that the owners of capital and those with enterprise <Col N="1459" /> should be encouraged and not have their income reduced to make them use their capital to create jobs.  They get tax breaks, incentives and direct payments from the taxpayer.  I have heard of the carrot and stick approach but this is a case of the carrot for one and the stick for the other, the stick being used quite exclusively on one.  Those who are against the proposal of a basic income for all are continuing to argue for the exploitation of cheap labour, and that involves mostly women and young people; for continued dependency status for women; for coninued means testing of young people against the income of others; and for the continuation of the snoopers' charter against couples living together.  That gives us the present failed system which causes rather than eliminates poverty.</P>
      <P>The concept of long term unemployed was not envisaged in terms of the welfare state.  However, long term unemployment is now widespread.  It must be seen that social insurance is no longer capable of dealing with the failure of our capitalist society to provide jobs for people.  In our society one million people are below the poverty line &mdash; these are not my figures, they are the figures published by a Government agency.  This is a socially explosive situation which, if it is to be dealt with, requires new thinking and combined action.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I will make suggestions by way of attempting to redirect resources to where they could be better used, but I will be hampered in this by the parliamentary procedures we are bound by.  These procedures are designed &mdash; and I am not impugning the Chair in any sense &mdash; to protect the Government of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tabled 41 amendments to the Social Welfare Bill, many of which are related but because of procedure they will be taken in isolation.  However, we will do the best with the tools that are to hand.  My amendments seek to limit the regressive measures in the Bill and to begin a movement towards a non-means tested basic income.  Then I seek a declaration of an official poverty line as <Col N="1460" /> established by the Commission on Social Welfare and the bringing forward of payment dates to April rather than May each year.  All the measures for additional take come into operation in April but all the additional give take effect in May.  The two dates should coincide.</P>
    <P>I will be seeking to amalgamate child benefit and family income supplement payments, which would be taxable, to redirect these payments, and, if that is not acceptable, the automatic payment of family income supplement.  There is no longer any good reason that family income supplement cannot be paid automatically to everybody who qualifies for it.  I will be asking also that net rather than gross income of applicants be taken into account.  I will be seeking to amend the Bill to further extend payments to all children in full-time education regardless of the types of social welfare payments their parents are in receipt of.</P>
    <P>I will be seeking also to abolish the means test for carers.  Carers are a special group who save the State a huge sum of money every year.  When I was on the health board in 1985, the cost of keeping a patient in St. Vincent's Hospital, Athy, was £250 per week.  I am sure it is more than that now.  I know numerous people, mostly women, who without payment, care for people who live in their own homes, the new carer's allowance may as well not have been introduced as far as they are concerned.  They are excluded from the health board payments for those who assist old people in their homes because they are related to the old person, and because the Minister has a £2 income limit on the carer's allowance they are excluded from that payment also.  I have extensive contact with the public through my clinic system and I have not yet met one person who qualified for the carer's allowance.  I cannot imagine how anybody would qualify, because if they had only £2, they would die of hunger.  The Minister said that 2,000 or was it 4,000, who were found somewhere in the country, are in receipt of this allowance.  The idea of a carer's allowance is excellent but the means test kills the idea.  Get rid of that or bring the <Col N="1461" /> figure up to £58 so that people can get a top up payment for doing this excellent work for the whole of society.  This work not alone saves the Government and health boards money but the carers provide a higher standard of care than could be provided in any institution &mdash; old people get loving care in their own homes where they should be.  The Minister should take this on board.  He should try to twist the arm of his colleague to provide more money for this good scheme and to expand it.</P>
    <P>We will also be moving an amendment to stop means testing of individuals against the means of others.  What the Minister has done puts me in mind of a game called giant steps and baby steps. The Minister has taken a tiny baby step in this regard &mdash; I grant he is breaking the barrier by allowing £5 per week to people who are living at home because they are means-tested against the income of others.  I am sure if such people had the resources to take a constitutional case it would be found to be unconstitutional that somebody should be judged against the income of somebody else.  I instanced cases of this earlier.</P>
    <P>We will also be moving an amendment to remove the ceiling on the PRSI payments. There is no reason in the world why a person on £19,000 per annum should not pay any more PRSI.  There is every reason in the world why one should have to pay on all one's income above that.  It is a gross insult to the people at the bottom of the ladder that people at the top of the ladder are told they do not have to pay.  The Minister has now expanded care for people who will not have to pay.  We will now have a situation where somebody on £40 a week will pay a much higher percentage of his income &mdash; and he will actually pay on £40 a week &mdash; than a consultant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>But separately &mdash; there is an exemption under £60.  He will not pay anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an exemption.  It is another poverty trap because when he goes over that level, even £1 over it, he pays on it all.  We have argued that case before.</P>
      <P>We will be arguing for the establishment and acceptance by the Government of a minimum adequate payment as established by the Commission on Social Welfare.  For a single person in 1991 terms, that is £62.</P>
      <P>We will also be proposing an amendment to provide that the entitlement at present enjoyed by widows and other women will not exclude them from entitlements they would have by virtue of their contributions to the Department of Social Welfare when they were employed.  We certainly will not be agreeing with the proposal being made by the Minister that part-time workers will only get part-time social welfare benefits if they are unemployed or sick.  That is simply not acceptable.</P>
      <P>We will not support the proposal that money will be recovered from recipients who, through no fault of their own, received an over-payment.  I give the example of somebody who got £1 extra by mistake from the Department over a period of years and accumulated a couple of hundred pounds and suddenly there is a demand for a payment.  If the Department make a mistake of that nature they will have to carry the loss as far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>We will also be asking for an increase in the amount an adult dependant can earn.  At present a wife is allowed to earn £55 and we are asking that that be increased to £75.  We also want to get rid of the anomaly in the scheme whereby a part-time worker in this House, for example, would simply be means tested on that week's pay slip.  The dependent spouses of the self-employed are averaged over a period of a year.  I do not see why the same privilege should not be granted to PAYE workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will not support the proposal the <Col N="1463" /> Minister is making in regard to the deduction of rents to county councils, to private landlords, the ESB or the telephone company from social welfare cheques.  The experience in Britain and elsewhere where such a system was brought in was that unscrupulous people put pressure on recipients of social welfare to have deductions made which they could not afford.</P>
    <P>Likewise, we will not support the Minister's proposal in the Bill to grant rights to his inspectors to literally enter the bedrooms of couples living together to establish whether they are cohabiting.  I have been trying to get a definition of cohabitation from the Department and the guidelines inspectors operate under &mdash; I have failed to do it &mdash; so that I would at least be instructed by the guidelines that are being used.  Imagine the difficulties in establishing whether somebody was cohabiting in a block of flats with a common hall entrance or in adjoining bedsitters.  I think we can afford to do without that type of intrusion of privacy.</P>
    <P>The long term goal of the Labour Party is the elimination of poverty and dependency through a fair distribution of wealth and resources.  We believe that a minimum adequate payment is the bottom line in all of this, and a distribution through a system of universal payments and taxation would remove all of the anomalies I know of and most of the poverty traps in the present system.  It would also restore dignity, self-assurance and status to the recipients and to the operatives who have to carry out the work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a small contribution to this very important Bill.  The Social Welfare Bill is of enormous importance as far as the less privileged people in our society are concerned.  This country has one of the best records in Europe with regard to its social welfare system.  We have made major strides in the past 20 years in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the legislation over that period has been progressive.  That is the sort of <Col N="1464" /> legislation we are all glad to be associated with because of the contribution it has made to making the lives of the less well off in our society that little bit better. If we look at our rates of payments in comparison with those of our nearest neighbours we will see that the benefits we have are much greater.  We have the benefit of electricity allowances, telephone allowances and travel.  These are things which our nearest neighbour does not have.  We are the envy of many of our European partners in regard to some of the fringe benefits we provide.</P>
    <P>In caring for the under-privileged the Government have a responsibility and those of us who are lucky enough to be in employment have to be prepared to make a contribution towards those who are not as well of.  Anybody who begrudges social welfare to those receiving it is not understanding or caring.</P>
    <P>The record of the Government is unquestionable so far as social welfare improvements are concerned.  The Minister's record is one of the best of any Minister for Social Welfare.  Nonetheless we must examine the social welfare system in its entirety.  We must ascertain where it is going, who it is helping and who will be its beneficiaries in the future. We must remember that we have now a new type of society in which the welfare sector is being catered for reasonably well.  There is an in between category of people who are unable to make ends meet and to whom the social welfare system is unable to contribute in terms of their needs.  These are people who have become unemployed through no fault of theirs, whose needs are not being met by the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>We should examine the possibility of introducing a second tier system to which such people could contribute, that is people outside the PRSI category who would be willing to contribute to the provision of a safety net for their future needs.  We have now a new category of poor to help to get over the hump in times of severe financial pressure brought about by unemployment or other unforeseen circumstances.  The only organisation that can help such people is the <Col N="1465" /> Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Rather than the resources of that society being directed to helping members of the middle class in our society who are experiencing difficulty occasioned by unemployment or other circumstances they should be directed to people in the main poverty trap, those who have been in receipt of long term social welfare assistance, with a background of unemployment and under-privilege.</P>
    <P>There are many people in built-up areas in our larger cities and towns whose address can determine whether they succeed in getting a job rather than their qualifications or abilities.  That is sad. Indeed, it is a reflection on our society.  I appeal to employers not to look first at an applicant's address but rather at their abilities and qualifications to undertake the task for which they are being recruited.</P>
    <P>We must also examine unemployment assistance and benefits, the beneficiaries of which do not receive the necessary recognition.  I say that for two reasons. The present method of assessment does not work to the benefit of the State or of those in receipt of unemployment assistance. Many smallholders are having their means assessed not at all in line with their actual income or profit.  Some years ago farmers were assessed under the PLV system which was abolished.  While some of us might not have been wholly in agreement with it at least it did not take away people's incentive to better their lot.  At present farmers in disadvantaged areas who increase their incomes and productivity, will discover that their social welfare payments will be reduced, thereby maintaining them within the poverty trap, unable to become self-sufficient. Somewhat more encouragement and flexibility on the part of the Department and their officers in the assessment of such people's means might well be of greater benefit to the community and the country as a whole.  There is a dire necessity to examine the assessment of means in such cases because, in the case of many smallholders, it is not possible to arrive at a wholly factual assessment.  This is brought about because many such <Col N="1466" /> smallholders will purchase items used on their farms, not classified as being for farm use, and do not retain the necessary documents to enable them claim such expenses.</P>
    <P>A fairer system to be applied to such people would be the striking of a rate agreed by Teagasc in regard to the profitability of each livestock unit on a farm rather than adhering to the present unit which is inconsistent and, in many instances, dependent on the humour of the social welfare officer investigating the means of such smallholders.  Very often three or four visits are necessitated by a social welfare officer, sometimes even a senior inspector, to assess the means of somebody who may have two cows on his farm.  That happens, leading to unnecessary expense and hassle on the part of the State in that such smallholders are subjected to enormous pressure they are often unable to withstand.  We should request the Department to seriously examine the system of investigating means, to examine the possibility of rendering it a one-stop, once-off investigation rather than the system that obtains at present.</P>
    <P>Another source of annoyance is that on occasion social welfare offices will inform people that they will receive benefit in the future and three or four weeks later they receive a letter from the Department informing them that they do not qualify. People's hopes should not be built up in this manner.  It should be possible for the social welfare officer investigating such cases to assess a person's means there and then if the full facts are put before him.  It is a simple matter of adding and subtracting and all social welfare officers are capable of that.  More of their time could be devoted to being helpful to people.  Many people are unaware of their full entitlements and/or expenses.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that so many young people living at home apply for social welfare assistance.  We have all heard of cases assessed with means as high as £25 and £30 per week, the children of people in receipt of social welfare benefits.  Often they are assessed with a brother's income, their mother's income &mdash; if she has a small <Col N="1467" /> job &mdash; or with their father's income whereas, in all such cases, they are not the beneficiaries of such income.  This is some thing that must be examined.  Perhaps a better method of assessing such means would be to put a nominal value on a bed in a household.  In many such cases a young person may be a burden on other members of the household being further reduced.  We must seriously examine the means of assessing young people's incomes.  I contend that young people find no joy in applying for unemployment assistance but do so rather because it is necessary to supplement the household income.  For example, it is very hard on any young person in receipt of unemployment assistance to be told by parents that there is insufficient money available for them to go to, say, a disco with their friends at weekends.  As a society we must address the situation.</P>
    <P>Delays in regard to investigation of claims for all types of benefit should be looked at.  Because of the investment by the Department of Social Welfare over the past number of years in equipment and computers they should be in a position to carry out the necessary investigations much quicker.  It is terrible for a person who has applied for benefit to be told that he may have to wait six to eight weeks before their case is fully investigated and a decision given.  The background information should now be in the computer system and this should help to shorten the waiting period.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that this is the second year in which we have had the benefit of the carer's allowance, it should be looked at in general.  The carer's allowance would be of tremendous benefit if the system was properly developed, and it could save enormous expenditure on health.  It is very difficult to become eligible for the allowance.  It is only the income of the person who is providing the full-time care and attention that should be taken into account.  It is not fair to assess the husband's income.  Some type of tax credit should be provided for families who do not qualify on means grounds for the carer's allowance.  This system provides <Col N="1468" /> a much needed social service.  Many of our people who are at present in long term hospital care would not be there if adequate allowances were available.  The carer's allowance is the first attempt that has been made to have a system put in place.  I know the Minister is totally committed to making it more widely available. I hope the Government will provide for people who would like to keep their relatives at home but who could not face the burden which taking those relatives out of long term hospital care would impose on them.  This system could also create jobs because many people would be prepared to give up their jobs to look after elderly relatives if they were not debarred from payments because of their spouse's income.</P>
    <P>There is a need to further publicise the social welfare system and the benefits which are available.  Many people are ignorant of their social welfare entitlements. A major publicity campaign, by means of the postal service or otherwise, should be engaged in so that people are made fully aware of their social welfare entitlements.  Many people do not claim social welfare benefits and live in poverty and ignorance of their entitlements.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement is a new idea and should be further expanded to get people who are tempted between staying on social welfare and going into low paid employment to go into employment. Whatever hope they have of living a normal life in regard to their own respect, they have a much better chance if they are in employment.  The family income supplement is the only means by which some of these people will be able to get back into employment and it should be expanded if at all possible.</P>
    <P>The appeals system must be looked at. People who appeal cases in regard to disability benefit, unemployment assistance, non contributory old age pensions are being harassed in many cases.  We all know of people, who are in poor health and perhaps awaiting major surgery or hospitalisation, and who have been debarred from disability benefit when they are fully entitled to it.  Medical referees are known to have refused people <Col N="1469" /> without ever looking at them except perhaps looking at them as they entered the examination centre and forming the opinion, having read their file, that they were capable of work.  This is not a proper examination.  In many cases the general practitioners have stated that they would not even issue the certificates to allow them to resume work or to go on to unemployment benefit.  These are the types of problems that do not help so far as the image of the Department of Social Welfare are concerned.  The Department of Social Welfare has an uncaring image whereas the opposite is the case.  The Department of Social Welfare, in many cases, do their utmost to help people. The appeals system, as now in place, can become much more beneficial to the claimants than was the old system.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that many people have to go to the Ombudsman to receive their fair entitlements rather than the Department admitting to mistakes that have been made.  When that type of difficulty arises it does not do anything for the politicians or for this House.  People have been forced to go to the Ombudsman, who decided in their favour, despite the fact that there had been overwhelming evidence to support the people's case in the Department of Social Welfare.  Perhaps the Minister would examine that issue if he gets an opportunity.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look at some system for funding people who find themselves in the limbo of waiting for appeals to be dealt with by the Department of Social Welfare. People who have been disqualified by appeals officers are not entitled to receive any allowance from the health board.</P>
    <P>There have been abuses of the social welfare system, as mentioned in this House.  It is time to change the system in this regard as people may, through ignorance, be abusing it.  People sign a week in advance for unemployment assistance. If they get some type of part-time work and if for some reason they forget to sign off for a day they will find themselves in trouble at a later stage.  If a reduction was to be made in benefits over a period in <Col N="1470" /> respect of people found guilty of abuses to recoup the amount lost by the Department and if there was a penalty on top of that, this would be much more beneficial than dragging people into courts, to have them prosecuted, and then to find that because of the Social Welfare Acts they are debarred but they are entitled to go to the health board and claim the full rates of benefit.  So far as the crime they have committed is concerned, they do not suffer very much.  The only thing that is appreciated by those found guilty of abuse is if it hurts them in their pocket. I would ask the Minister to consider a system whereby people found guilty of abuses would not lose their benefit because in being taken off the social welfare recipients list they automatically qualify for benefit from the health board and there is little or no financial loss to them.  Unless there is major abuse, no action should be taken against people, who through ignorance, abuse the system.</P>
    <P>Consideration should also be given to the position of returned emigrants.  Over the past few months many people who were unemployed in the United Kingdom have returned to this country.  The first questions these people are asked by social welfare officers are: how did you get home?  Who maintained you when you came home?  How have you been maintained over this period?  Even though many of these people were not employed in the UK, social welfare officers do not believe them.  These people have to endure untold turmoil trying to prove to social welfare officers that they do not have any income.  The present system where people have to prove that their income is less than the qualifying limit for unemployment is not the proper way of showing that we have a caring social welfare system.</P>
    <P>When one looks at this Social Welfare Bill and the way our social welfare system has operated over the past 20 years, one can see that major strides have been made in this area.  We have gone a long way down the road all of us would like to see our social welfare system go.  Our social welfare system assists those in <Col N="1471" /> need, and we do not want anybody to be left in need.  Despite the tight financial constraints under which they had to operate over the past number of years, the Government have made enormous strides in the social welfare area.  This is one area which has not suffered as a result of Government cutbacks.</P>
    <P>Our rates of social welfare payments are well in line with those of other countries, and ahead of many of our EC partners. Nevertheless, improvements can always be made.  The Government are trying to eliminate the anomalies in the social welfare system one by one and the Government and the Department of Social Welfare must be seen to be doing this work.  The present Minister is one of the most caring Ministers for Social Welfare in the history of this State.  The Government have made major strides in the social welfare area and the Social Welfare Bill, 1991, will be a major contributor in bringing about further improvements in our social welfare system.  However, we will not be happy until we have a social welfare system which is not operated on the basis of means testing, as at present.  We need to make further improvements so that our social welfare system is not abused.  The improvements being made at present must be continued in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the comments made by my constituency colleague in regard to the problems in our social welfare system.  A number of these problems will have to be taken into consideration by the Government.  I welcome the increases provided for in the Bill.  We all recognise the grave problems in our social welfare system.  Even though £3 billion will be spent in this area this year, many people still fall into the poverty trap.  It is essential that this money is spent properly so that the underprivileged are looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's allowance has received a great deal of publicity and was heralded as a great move for those who look after the old, infirm and sick in our society. However, as many Deputies on all sides <Col N="1472" /> have pointed out, because of the way it is assessed the carer's allowance does not get to the heart of the problem and many people who are entitled to this allowance do not receive it.  The current system of assessment militates against rural communities, and especially against small farmers.  If a farmer has more than eight cattle his spouse is not entitled to receive a carer's allowance.  I ask the Minister to look again at the system of assessment for this allowance.</P>
    <P>The system of assessment for unemployment assistance is causing consternation, for people living in rural Ireland.  For example, the prices farmers received for cattle in 1986 and 1987 are taken into consideration in assessing their eligibility for unemployment assistance. As most people know, the price of cattle has decreased since 1986 and 1987 when prices were inflated.  This anomaly needs to be rectified.  If a farmer has ten cows social welfare officers automatically assume each cow will have a calf.  Every farmer would be delighted if each cow had a calf but account must be taken of the possibility of an outbreak of TB; this means herds have to be locked up.  This is causing great difficulties for many farmers.  These issues are not taken into account by the Department of Social Welfare and I ask the Minister to look further at them.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the appeals system.  The appeals system is a source of great alarm for Deputies and other public representatives.  A person who appeals a decision may have to wait for up to six months for a reply.  I know this may only happen in extreme cases but, on average, people have to wait three or four months for a reply.  There is no logical reason a person who is entitled to social welfare benefit should have to wait that length of time before a decision is made on his appeal.  I do not know what reasons are given for the delays, but the Department must look again at the present appeals system. When Deputies, who are in a privileged position, put down parliamentary questions, action is taken and decisions are made more quickly.  This is not fair on <Col N="1473" /> society in general.  Everybody should be dealt with as fairly as possible and people should have to wait three or four weeks at the most for a decision on their appeals.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I want to refer to the position of young people who when they apply for unemployment assistance have the income of the entire household taken into consideration.  This system flies in the face of giving independence to individuals and needs to be changed. The vast majority of young people who apply for social welfare benefits do so out of necessity.  It is essential that they be allowed some money as it must be soul destroying for any boy or girl unemployed since leaving school to have to go to their parents for money.  Perhaps their parents may not have money to give them.  This is a serious anomaly in the social welfare system and it will have to be addressed as a matter of urgency in the House.</P>
    <P>Medical referees have come in for some abuse in this debate.  What happens is that after the local GP has decided a person is unfit to work, they go to a centre where they are assessed by a medical referee who, perhaps after looking at them coming through the door, decides that the person is able to walk and talk and inevitably is able to work.  The system is wrong.  Deputy Stagg was correct when he said that even if the decision is appealed on numerous occasions, because of the way the system works medical referees do not want to let their counterparts down with the result that the person who is entitled to receive a social welfare benefit does not receive any payment. It is a vicious circle and there is no way out.  Unfortunately, I have no bright ideas as to how we could improve it but there is room for improvement in relation to the kind of person used as a medical referee.</P>
    <P>My main reason for speaking on the Bill is that I want to deal with Part V of the Bill which deals with the measures to combat fraud and control abuse.  I think everyone will agree there is fraud and abuse but &mdash; Deputy Stagg beat me to the punch &mdash; it seems from the guidelines laid down by the Department of Social <Col N="1474" /> Welfare that one is guilty until proven innocent.  This flies in the face of the principle applied in all civilised societies. It would appear that the social welfare officer or whoever deals with the case expects an applicant for a social welfare payment to be on the make.  The applicant has to prove he or she is entitled to the payment.  There are great anomalies in the system.  As a society, we should adopt a more caring attitude to applicants for social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which is a source of great concern for me and I thought long and hard about it before coming into the House this morning to bring it up with the Minister.  I have listened to most of the debate and nobody has said anything about it.  I have received many complaints in my constituency about the external control unit of the Department of Social Welfare who turn up with a list of names in an area every few months. They bring the people named on the list into a local hall where, from the information I have been given, they are harassed and intimidated.  From the stories I have heard, the only thing one can compare them with is the Gestapo or the Stasi in East Germany&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It would seem, therefore, that they operate on their own and turn up in an area every few months where they create a lot of hassle and annoyance for people who, in my view, are genuinely entitled to receive social welfare payments.  I do not know what their record is or what amount of money they save for the Department of Social Welfare but they are certainly causing many problems throughout the country. A public investigation, if not a ministerial investigation, should be carried out immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the increases from July in the rates of social welfare payments announced in the budget.  In that budget measures to protect and improve living standards for those who depend on social welfare were outlined.  The 1991 budget is the first step in implementing the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which will lead to greater social equity and welfare improvements.  The increases announced and outlined in the Bill bring the gross expenditure on social welfare schemes <Col N="1478" /> and services to over £3 billion in a full year.  This is the first time the £3 billion barrier has been broken.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to support the 4 per cent increase in all social welfare and health board payments.  Increases of up to 11 per cent are being given to those on the lowest payments.  This is the fourth year in succession the Government have given special increases to the lowest paid. The child income support has been significantly improved for families dependent on social welfare and those in low paid jobs.  The family income supplement has also been substantially improved. Four years ago there was a very complex system with regard to child income support, with 36 different rates of child dependant allowance.  The Government have now simplified and streamlined this procedure to three different rates.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the raising to 21 years the age to which child dependant allowance is paid to the long term unemployed, old age pensioners and invalidity pensioners where the child is in full time education.  The Government have thus recognised the important emphasis laid by Irish parents and guardians on education and in so doing have enhanced educational opportunities in a very practical way.  In this Bill the Government once again demonstrate the very positive and practical way in which they wish to support and care for the vulnerable sections of society.  In recognition of the emotional trauma which parents have to endure following the sad loss of a child the Minister for Social Welfare will continue payment of child dependant allowance for six weeks after the death of a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, in this Bill, have provided for increases in weekly personal rates of widow's pensions, deserted wife's allowance, prisoner's wife's allowance, lone parent's allowance and single women's allowance.  The carer's allowance introduced by the Government last November is a most innovative scheme and was an important development in our social structure.  I am very pleased to note the increase in the maximum personal rate to £50 per week from July next.  I am <Col N="1479" /> also pleased that the scheme has been extended to cover carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance and persons in receipt of a pension from another member state of the EC or from a country with whom Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.</P>
    <P>I would however ask the Minister to once again examine the means test for carer's allowance.  The means test at present is very strict, and by relaxing it we would be able to keep our older people within the community structure for a longer period, thus giving them the best quality of life in the heart of the family where they wish to remain.  By doing so we would be freeing many geriatric beds for which we all know there is a great need, particularly in my own constituency of County Clare where there is perhaps a greater number of old people than in other areas.  There is an increasing need for geriatric beds.  If more people were in receipt of carer's allowance more elderly people could be looked after in their homes where they wish to stay, thereby freeing more geriatric beds for those who need particular medical care and attention.</P>
    <P>I support the Deputies who have said it is unfair that the carer's allowance is based in many cases on the spouse's income.  It is usually the woman of the household who looks after the elderly relatives, and it is unjust that many of these women are not entitled to the allowance because it is based on their husband's income.  Perhaps the Minister will reconsider the means test for carer's allowance with a view to creating a more healthy community environment where older people would be able to stay at home thereby freeing much needed geriatric beds in many of our hospitals.</P>
    <P>On the means test I support Deputy Ellis who suggested flexibility in assessing social welfare benefits, particularly for small farmers.  I am sure all Members have heard time and time again through clinic work in our respective constituencies of the difficulties experienced by constituents when being assessed for social welfare payments.  I am aware of <Col N="1480" /> cases where recipients have had their hopes raised by the Department of Social Welfare who lead them to believe they may receive social welfare benefit, but once the assessment was carried out and the paper work completed those people were ineligible either for any benefit or for increases in their benefit.  I appeal to the Minister to review means tests generally.  Perhaps the Department would be more flexible when assessing individuals, particularly small farmers and people in rural areas, for social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Ellis when he said the appeals system needed to be looked at.  There are delays in the system of which we are all aware.  We know there are difficulties for the staff but perhaps something could be done to ensure the delays are shortened.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the <i>pro rata</i> pensions for pensioners who fail to qualify for a contributory old age pension and retirement pensions because they have mixed insurance records.  This arises because of gaps in their social insurance records for periods in their working career when they were in public service type employment.  Many people who found themselves in this position have come to public representatives such as myself, and I am glad this provision will help these individuals.</P>
    <P>Another very important and positive step in this Bill is the provision whereby the long term unemployed person will be able to sign off the live register and take up short term employment or seasonal work for up to 52 weeks without losing his long term status on returning to the system.  At present a person is allowed stay out of the system for only 20 weeks without losing his long term status.  The new provision is a further incentive to people to take up short time work, I support it and I thank the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <P>I want to make particular reference to sections 18, 19 and 20 which provide social welfare protection for 21,000 part-time workers.  This is a very innovative measure which will help the 21,000 people who are at present in part-time <Col N="1481" /> work.  The statistics show that at least 80 per cent of those people are women, 30 per cent of whom are under the age of 25.  In helping these part-time workers we will be helping very many who traditionally have had to take up part-time work to supplement their spouse's income and keep the family going financially. They have done this on a consistent basis without the protection of social welfare payments.  Under sections 18, 19 and 20 their position will be safeguarded, and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>I have noticed in the last few days that there seems to be controversy with regard to this part of the Bill.  I happily refer to the Minister's speech on Thursday, 14 March, when introducing the Bill to the House.  When referring to the section on part-time workers he said:</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that I will not hesitate to review the threshold if employers reduce hours or wages to exclude these vulnerable employees who are mainly women.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for that unequivocal statement and I am sure the Government will stand firm on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government have shown consistently over many many years &mdash; even as we as a nation undergo very difficult economic circumstances &mdash; that they are steadfastly behind those in most need in our community; even though we have experienced financial difficulties for some years now, time and time again, in every single budget, the Department of Social Welfare have been in receipt of increases on a consistent basis.  I am glad that this year has been no exception; there has been a great advance in the area of social welfare as already outlined by my colleagues on this side of the House and indeed by some of the more gracious Members opposite.  I take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister for the work he has done on behalf of the Government in this sphere so that the Department of Social Welfare have become more efficient and wish to help their recipients in every way they possibly can.  As in any Department, there is always room for improvement and I know <Col N="1482" /> the officials within the Department are always very glad to try to bring about any possible improvements.</P>
    <P>I am proud the Government have ensured, right through these financially difficult times, that the people in most need in our community, those on social welfare, people trying to keep their heads above water on a low wage and trying to look after their families, are being looked after, supported and assisted in every way possible &mdash; as they should be &mdash; by the Government and the Minister.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the House that I am putting down an amendment on Committee Stage to require the Department of Social Welfare to provide counselling services for persons who have suffered bereavement so that they will benefit from advice on the cost of funerals, particularly in the Dublin region.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that such a provision be made in the Social Welfare Bill because persons who have suffered bereavement are &mdash; in Dublin city &mdash; being taken advantage of to an enormous extent which means that they pay twice and sometimes three times the cost of what an average funeral should be.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter with the Dublin city funeral directors who style themselves the Irish Association of Funeral Directors, they refused to debate this matter publicly with me on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; some months ago and refused to meet me.  I am specifically talking about the cost of Dublin funerals as I do not have experience of their cost outside Dublin.  I want to quote from a letter received from the Honorary Secretary of the Irish Association of Funeral Directors, 54 Aungier Street, Dublin 2:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Mitchell,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thank you for your letter of 27th February 1991.  Having discussed the matter with the members of our Association in the Dublin area, the consensus of opinion is that the statement issued to the Fine Gael Press Office and the media on Monday, 14 January 1991, by the undersigned was <Col N="1483" /> most comprehensive and requires little, if any, further clarification.  Furthermore, the response to your question in Dáil Éireann given by the Minister of State in the Department of Industry and Trade was acceptable to our members and indeed to the general public.  Thus it is, we feel, unnecessary for us to meet you but should the &ldquo;number of people concerned about the cost of funerals in Dublin&rdquo; wish to contact the undersigned we will be happy to meet them and clarify any points that they may wish to discuss with us.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Honorary Secretary of the Irish Association of Funeral Directors.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that the funeral directors wrote the reply to the Adjournment Debate which I raised in this House some months ago.  Indeed they were sitting in the public gallery gloating while the point which I fairly raised in this House was being dismissed by a member of the Government.  I accused the Irish Association of Funeral Directors of arrogance, disdain, secretiveness, smugness, indifference and offensiveness.  It is wholly unacceptable that a group which have, if you like, cornered, the market in Dublin city and who are dealing with people at their most vulnerable, people who have often been suddenly bereaved and who only want to do the best for their loved ones who have departed, do not explain how they manage to charge twice and three times the cost for funerals in Dublin city over and above the cost on the periphery of Dublin and in adjoining counties.</P>
    <P>It has been made clear to me by reputable funeral undertakers that an average funeral should cost between £600 to £800, including a hearse, coffin, and one mourning car.  A minimum of £1,710 and a maximum of £3,260 is being charged for one hearse and one mourning car in Dublin city; indeed, many people will have two mourning cars.  Those figures are an absolute disgrace.  I can give a <Col N="1484" /> breakdown as they were supplied to me by a member of the Irish Association of Funeral Directors.  No wonder they do not want to meet me, no wonder they do not want their charges to be held up to any sort of examination.  It is a matter for this House if there are monopolies in this city in relation to people who are vulnerable after a bereavement.  They are being taken advantage of when they are at their lowest ebb.  We now know what RIP stands for, it is not &ldquo;rest in peace&rdquo;, it is &ldquo;rip -off.&rdquo;  That is what is happening in this city and these arrogant people, led by the Honorary Secretary of the Irish Association of Funeral Directors refused to meet me to debate the matter or to give any account of their actions although they are taking advantage of vulnerable people.  It is a disgrace which deserves the attention of this House.  It is the performance of a vulture to behave in this way.  That association is a closed, tightly knit group and are making a fortune, the morgue millionaires.  I regret to tell the House that I have given them every opportunity to debate the matter but they have refused to do so.</P>
    <P>The problem is &mdash; this is why I am tabling an amendment on Committee Stage &mdash; that often old people pay insurance contributions for a number of years to cover the eventuality of their death.  However, when that happens very often their families have to pay for the funerals because the amount the old people paid only comes to a few hundred pounds.  Mind you, a few hundred pounds would go a long way towards burying a person if they had access to people who operate on the periphery of the city, such as in Swords or Sallynoggin, who are quite capable of performing funerals in Dublin.  However, a few hundred pounds will not cover the cost if you go to a Dublin city funeral director.</P>
    <P>The second problem is where youngsters die.  Legislation provides that children under the age of 12 can only be insured for &ldquo;reasonable funeral expenses&rdquo;; a sum of £2,000 or £3,000 is not a reasonable funeral expense.  If a youngster dies in Dublin and if his people are in poor circumstances, they often <Col N="1485" /> have to depend on collections by their neighbours to pay for the funeral.  The funeral directors often charge £50 for church costs.  It has been made clear to me by one priest that he gets £15 for receiving the remains, saying the Mass &mdash; the remains are kept in the church overnight &mdash; and going to the funeral next day, yet the funeral directors say £50 is a reasonable charge.  That is the figure they gave me before they realised I was inquiring into this matter.  For dressing the corpse they charge £30.  This is usually done as a nixer by the hospital porter at certain Dublin hospitals.  By doing this the hospital porter is ensuring the monopoly of undertakers so that you cannot break into the market.  As I said, there should be a counselling system in the Department of Social Welfare to advise people who are bereaved, to caution them and tell them where they can get a funeral for £600 to £800 &mdash; it can be done with very little inconvenience &mdash; and not have to pay £2,000 or £3,000.  At the rate of 7,000 funerals per year in Dublin at an average cost of £2,000 per funeral &mdash; I do not think everybody pays £3,260&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I am quite sure the detail you are now referring to will be debated.  Provision ought to be made for that and I am sure you will be seeking to raise it on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  I want to finish this general point in my Second Stage contribution.  I will go into that detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seven thousand funerals at about £2,000 a funeral is £14 million among a handful of undertakers in Dublin.  Is it any wonder they do not want to debate with me, they do not want to account to this House, they do not want to answer questions or face an examination?  I ask the Minister to look into the matter before Committee Stage to find out for himself whether I am right.  Let it be examined in detail.  Why will they not answer questions?  These morgue millionaires will not answer questions because they know they are making lots of money <Col N="1486" /> from people who are at their most vulnerable. I find that a disgusting performance, particularly that they are not prepared to enter into discussions or to give an account of their dealings and that they behave in such an arrogant way.  I will pursue it and, if necessary.  I will introduce a Private Members' Bill to deal with it.</P>
    <P>They are charging £250 for a hearse and £170 for one mourning car, that is, £420.  In Dublin city, unlike the country, it is a short journey from, say, Crumlin to Mount Jerome, a taxi ride.  Imagine being charged £420 for a taxi ride.  If you got into a taxi and were asked for £420 or £170 to run down the road you would think the driver was mad, but because people are vulnerable and at their weakest, they do not want to know the details and they are charged a minimum of £420, and with the two mourning cars £590.  It is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>I have here a receipt for a Dublin city funeral carried out by one of these funeral directors in December 1965 and the cost was £74. 7s., that is, £74.35p in new money.  Using the CPI that equated to £736 in 1991.  Nowadays a person in Dublin city cannot get a funeral with one mourning car, coffin and hearse for £736, unless he goes to the undertaker in Swords, Sallynoggin, Kildare or Blessington, but that is what the undertakers were charging.  What has happened since then that they have to charge £1,700, £2,000 and £3,000?</P>
    <P>The people of Dublin should strike back against these undertakers and boycott them until they explain why they are imposing these charges on the bereaved of Dublin.  Bereavement will visit every family.  Death is the only sure thing, and when it happens people will have to pay these charges because if they try to beat the system they will find the people who hire the limousines would be boycotted by these monopolists in the Irish Association of Funeral Directors.  If they dare to hire the limousines to anybody who is not part of the association they will not be hired by the members of the association again.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the monopoly provisions <Col N="1487" /> Act provides that the Fair Trade Commission may carry out an inquiry into an apparent monopoly on the recommendation of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade or at the specific request of the Minister.  Two months ago I raised a question on the Adjournment and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, this great reforming Minister who stands by the Republic, sent his Minister of State in here to read a reply which was drafted by the funeral directors who sat in the Gallery sneering while he read it. Since this great reforming Minister has taken no action, I will ask the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to act.  I am going to introduce that amendment and I will be seeking the support of the House for my amendment.  I tried to raise this matter with the association and to debate it with them; I tried to meet them, but since they behaved in such an arrogant way I feel I have to seek other means of remedy.  I am looking to this House to highlight and deal with the situation and to pursue those who behave in such a disdainful and arrogant manner and take upon themselves this attitude because they feel they have a safe, secure monopoly in Dublin and nobody can do anything about it.  I ask the Minister to consider my amendment and support it. I will be returning to this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the Social Welfare Bill and the fact that the Minister for Social Welfare has again shown himself to be a very caring and considerate Minister in providing for substantial increases to people in different categories of social welfare.  Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government started the process of systematically giving special increases in social welfare to bring those on the lowest level of social welfare into line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  This year people on lower income rates of social welfare payments will receive an 11 per cent increase.  In 1986, for example, the personal rate of long term unemployment assistance was <Col N="1488" /> £36 per week.  This July it will be £55, an increase of approximately 50 per cent. That shows this Government are committed to increasing the social welfare payments for those people.  We hear a great deal of talk from the far side about what should and should not be done.  They had an opportunity from 1982 to 1987 to implement such increases, but nothing happened.  I compliment the Minister for ensuring that the less well off, the lower paid and those on social welfare received substantial increases and were brought into line with what is needed to survive today.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a few suggestions that would alleviate problems for people on social welfare benefit, particularly those on unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and disability benefit.  I ask him to consider the introduction of a freefone system in the Department of Social Welfare.  Every little company in the country at the moment operate a freefone 1800 system. It is important that the Minister for Social Welfare consider the introduction of a freefone system in his Department. There are social welfare offices in Letterkenny, Sligo and Dublin but if a person from Wexford wants to inquire about benefits he must spend a considerable time on the phone seeking information. I had a case recently where a lady had to ring Letterkenny about children's allowance. She spent £5.60 on the phone call and at the end still had not the answers she required, but had to give up because she had no more money.  The Minister should seriously consider introducing a freefone system in the Department as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation is an important part of Government policy but it is wrong to decentralise all the social welfare offices to the west.  The Minister should look at the possibility of setting up regional offices to cater for people in their local areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk lately about the women of Ireland.  I would say a few words about one group of &ldquo;mná na hÉireann,&rdquo; the widows who are not getting proper social welfare payments.  I <Col N="1489" /> know their benefit has increased substantially over the last number of years, but it is not enough.  It is traumatic to lose a husband but for a widow to find herself trying to maintain two to four children on basic social welfare is very hard.  It causes major hardship.  The Minister should introduce a special payment for a widow with two or more children to help pay for such things as first communion clothes, school uniforms, confirmation clothes and so on.</P>
    <P>If a man on invalidity or old age pension whose wife is not yet 66 dies, the widow automatically loses free telephone, free travel, free television licence and other benefits.  Widows who are 60 or over should be allowed retain those entitlements on the death of a husband. The present system creates hardship.  To accede to my request in this area would be the first step to ensure that people in this category are allowed to continue with the standard of living to which they had become accustomed while the husband was alive.  If the Minister acceded to this request it would be a gesture which would be welcomed by widows throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides have expressed concern for people claiming unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit and attending medical referees. The Minister set up an independent appeals tribunal to deal with this and I hope it will alleviate some of the problems. As a person without medical experience I sometimes wonder if medical referees are fully qualified having regard to decisions they make in relation to people who come before them.  I know of cases where people waiting to go into hospital, who had their appointment cards with them when they attended the medical referee, were cut off from disability benefit a week later.  Surely if a person has an appointment to go into hospital a week, two weeks or three weeks ahead, he should not be cut off from benefit by a medical referee.  The Minister should investigate why this is happening.  If there is no genuine reason for this, the medical referee should be struck off the panel straightaway.  These <Col N="1490" /> decisions are not right.  This problem has been raised not alone by me here today but by me last year and by other Deputies in the House.  I cannot understand why medical referees take such action when dealing with sick people.</P>
    <P>Since I came into the House in 1982, every year I have raised the attitude of social welfare officers to those on unemployment assistance.  Two years ago I suggested that the Minister for Social Welfare should introduce courses in courtesy and manners for social welfare officers dealing with the public.  If the complaints I have received as to the attitude of social welfare officers in dealing with people are true, the situation is appalling.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I do not think people would come to me or to other politicians complaining about this attitude if it was not true.  Unemployed people are being treated as second class citizens.  We all know that unemployment is a serious problem and that it is difficult to get jobs.  Social welfare officers should treat unemployed people with courtesy and respect because it is not their fault they do not have jobs.  I do not have sympathy for those who are working and signing on, but young people who for the first time go to make a claim for unemployment assistance are put through a dreadful system.  This treatment is not warranted.  When social welfare officers go to a house to see a person they take it on themselves to look into cupboards, wardrobes and presses; they look into everything in the house.  That is not right.  I have a case before the Minister at the moment where a woman on unmarried mother's allowance had to undergo this sort of treatment.  A social welfare officer came to reassess her entitlement, went through the house, found a pair of football boots in the wardrobe and on that basis decided she was cohabiting and cut off the unmarried mother's allowance.  That is a very serious <Col N="1491" /> matter for that person who, genuinely, is not cohabiting.  The social welfare officer went too far.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies have referred to the taking into account of the income of family members when assessing the means of a young person.  This is unfair because in many cases these family members are recipients of unemployment benefit or assistance or are receiving very low wages.  Parents often have to give the unemployed person extra money to keep going throughout the week.  The stopping of £20 or £25 is not very fair in these circumstances.  I appreciate that it is difficult to design a fair system of assessment but I am confident the Minister will consider this matter carefully.</P>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of the independent appeals tribunal.  People will now be assured of a fair hearing in the quickest possible time.  In the past there have been delays of months while people tried to get their benefits.  These delays were rather excessive and I would hope that the Minister would place a limit of three or four weeks on the giving of a decision and that this tribunal will generally speed up the process.</P>
      <P>The Minister has shown himself to be very concerned about people in receipt of social welfare payments.  Despite the difficult economic circumstances prevailing during the past few years he has managed to protect the amount of money provided for social welfare recipients. The sum of £3 billion is a lot of money. There must be flexibility in the disbursement of this money, as well as a caring attitude.  The changes and improvements introduced by the Minister in the social welfare code have shown that his heart is in the right place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family income supplement is a very important assistance for people on low incomes and I welcome the increase in the threshold.  I also welcome the fact that people receiving the FIS will not lose their entitlement to a medical card, although in some health board areas there is still some difficulty in obtaining <Col N="1492" /> one.  The Minister is not to blame for the fact that many people are not claiming the FIS since he has made every effort through the media to inform people about it.  The increase in the benefit should also be well publicised.  I hope that as many people as possible will take advantage of this payment because it can mean the difference between living on the breadline and having a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is in many respects a bone of contention.  Many people who expected to benefit were refused the allowance.  Every scheme has its teething problems and I would ask the Minister to look again at the means testing system, which may be too rigid.  I welcome the Minister's decision to extend the carer's allowance to people on DPMA.  Many Deputies put this suggestion to the Minister.  The Minister might also consider enabling more people to avail of this allowance.  If this were done a substantial amount of money could be saved in hospital maintenance costs.  It now costs about £500 a week to maintain a person in hospital.  If the carer's allowance were available, carers would be prepared to look after old people at home. Possibly the Department of Health could make money available to the Department of Social Welfare by working hand in hand on this issue.</P>
    <P>Social insurance for part-time workers is a welcome breakthrough which will ensure that social welfare benefits and pensions will be available to part-time workers.  Most of these workers are women, many of whom have been working less than 18 hours per week and have thus been unable to claim maternity benefit, sick pay and so on.  I welcome the inclusion of such people in the social welfare system.  I also commend the Minister for Labour on the introduction of protective legislation for part-time workers.  I hope employers will not try to find some way around the system. Already some of the major supermarkets are said to be considering ways to avoid the provisions of the legislation.  I would ask the Minister for Social Welfare, and the Minister for Labour, to ensure that <Col N="1493" /> major multi-nationals are not permitted to abuse part-time workers in that way.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his continued commitment to social welfare recipients and I would ask him to take on board some of the suggestions I have made. The Minister has in the past listened to Deputies from all sides in the interests of helping people on social welfare.  I hope that people who are entitled to adequate rates of payment will benefit greatly this year and in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill which gives effect to the provisions of the 1991 budget contains nothing constructive to deal with the continuing crisis of poverty.  The Labour Party believe that the social welfare provisions in the budget represent a failed opportunity and are totally inadequate in content to assist the thousands who are already living on low and inadequate incomes.</P>
      <P>During the past four years the Government have reduced Exchequer spending on social welfare by over 15 per cent in real terms.  This has resulted in a situation where over 30 per cent of households live below the poverty line.  All social welfare payments are below the Commission on Social Welfare's recommended minimum adequate income.  Thirty per cent of all employees receive a gross weekly income of less than £130 and nearly 35,000 children live in households on the poverty line.  This is a grim record of our social welfare policy.</P>
      <P>Social welfare increases are poor having regard to the low base on which they are calculated and also taking into account the Government's alleged commitment to the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The increases may appear to be slightly above the rate of inflation but they will not take effect until the last week in July; by then the increased VAT rates, and increases in ESB and telephone bills will have begun to bite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they will bite <Col N="1494" /> at the lower end of the income spectrum. The increase in local authority rents will nullify any increase in benefit for many thousands of householders.</P>
      <P>In every year that Fianna Fáil have been in office, except one, child benefit has been frozen so that its purchasing power today is less than it was in 1986. This year the Government did nothing more than apply the higher rate of child benefit, at present applicable to the fifth child and beyond, to the fourth child. This represents on average an increase of 40p per child per week.  This is only for mothers with four children and mothers with three children will get no increase in child benefit.  The larger the family, the smaller the average increase.  In the case of a family with six children the increase will be as low as 27p per child per week. The Government have done nothing for mothers and children in this context and because of the Government's lack of response, these changes will do little to end the poverty trap about which the Government talk so much.</P>
      <P>The Government are acting dishonestly in one area of the Bill.  In the Hyland case in 1988, the Supreme Court held that married couples were entitled to the same level of benefit as co-habiting couples but the Government's response has been to achieve equality by reducing the benefit available to co-habiting couples rather than increasing the benefit for married couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No other country in the European Communities is experiencing the persistent high levels of unemployment that affect Ireland.  Of the numbers on the live register, half of the men and one third of the women have now been out of work for more than 12 months.  The unemployment figures to date for 1991 indicate clearly that unemployment is set to rise by at least 12,000 on the figures for last year.  This level of increase in the number out of work over the past few months represents the emergence of a major crisis.  It also illustrates the total inadequacy of Government policy.  The Government's response has been rigid and narrow.  There has been a small increase in unemployment benefit and <Col N="1495" /> assistance.  Recent surveys have indicated that the 100,000 people on long term unemployment are five times more likely to suffer from high levels of psychological stress than those at work.  The mental and physical wellbeing of the long term unemployed must be taken into account by the Government.  However, the Government have been particularly unimaginative in their programme to assist the unemployed to return to work.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme, with all its anomalies, does not appear an attractive proposition for those out of work.  The original intention of the scheme was to offer the long term unemployed an opportunity to retrain with a view to re-entering the workforce.  The current treatment of workers on this scheme, who are not entitled to the family income supplement, rent allowance, fuel allowance or pay income must act as a disincentive to people considering participating in the scheme.  Workers on the SES scheme find themselves in the impossible position of being classified as neither employees nor social welfare recipients.  They do not enjoy the benefits of employees such as entitlement to sick leave, paid holiday or maternity leave or the entitlements of the long term unemployed. The Labour Party in their pre-budget submission stated there should be a major reform of the employment incentive schemes, increasing subsidies to employers who take on long term unemployed people.  In addition employers and trade unions, through the national agreement, should reserve one in every five vacancies for people who are long term unemployed.  In the first six months training assistance would be provided for every person hired and at the end of a three year period a £2,000 cash grant would be paid to an employer in respect of each participant in the scheme who is still at work.  The scheme would apply to full-time jobs only and would positively discriminate in favour of the long term unemployed.  Ultimately this scheme would be self-financing as the number of people in long term unemployment fell and began to contribute <Col N="1496" /> again to the Exchequer on their return to work.  I strongly urge the Government and the social partners through the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to take these proposals on board as part of a comprehensive attack on long term unemployment.  The social partners must be deeply disappointed that instead of radical reforms we have pilot projects involving no more than £500,000 in net revenue.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe that the Bill is totally removed from the very people it is supposed to help.  We believe in the establishment of a basic minimum annual income for all citizens regardless of sex, marital status, income or employment circumstances.  This is part of our long term goal of guaranteeing every citizen an income.  We did not expect the Government with their appalling record to set about establishing a minimum income for all but we had hoped that this Bill would start to conquer the divisions entrenched in our society.</P>
    <P>I will now deal briefly with some of the major problems in the Social Welfare Bill.  Many thousands of applicants for the carer's allowance have been disillusioned. During the passage of the Social Welfare Bill in 1990 I strongly urged the Minister at that time to seriously consider introducing that scheme on a non-means tested basis, the same as the child benefit scheme.  It has to be recognised that the scheme itself is excellent but it is disappointing that there are niggardly means tests.  Many speakers from the Government side and from the Minister's own party have commented on that over the past two days.  The Minister must be quite well aware that only a very small proportion of the total number of applicants have benefited from the scheme over the past 12 months.  It is widely known that the married women of Ireland are carrying the burden of caring for spouses and relatives for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year.  The lack of recognition by any Government up to this of that work has left many old people in long term institutions.  Because of the cost of institutional care, the aim of the <Col N="1497" /> Government and the Minister must be to make every effort to have people cared for in their own homes, where they are happiest.  Secondly, the saving by keeping them at home would contribute very substantially to the additional cost of abolishing the means test and operating the scheme on a basis similar to that for child benefit.  Because of the onerous and humanitarian nature of the work carried out it certainly deserves a very serious review.  As of now the scheme has caused massive frustration and disappointment on the part of many married women who looked forward to getting not only financial help but a recognition of the magnificent work they are doing contributing to the health and wellbeing of their spouses and relatives and, at the same time, saving the Exchequer many millions of pounds by keeping such people out of institutions.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism throughout the community of investigations relating to unemployment assistance. Applicants are intimidated by the investigation, and the degree of suspicion on the part of the official carrying out the investigation means that the applicant is not forthcoming.  People have great difficulty completing the questionnaires submitted to them.  This also applies to old age non-contributory pensioners.  I came across a case this week of a widow who after losing her husband sold off a few cattle on a very small holding that carried a milk quota of 2,500 gallons.  People will recognise that there is little chance today of selling a milk quota.  The investigating officer in this case called three times to this applicant who was finally told that if she did not sell her quota 25p a gallon would be taken into account in the financial assessment relating to her pension.  I had hoped that there would have been more sympathy and sensitivity on the part of the Department.  A milk quota lying idle is of no financial benefit to an unfortunate woman of 67 years of age living on her own having lost her husband and having disposed of what stock she had. Yet she was told that an invisible income of 25p per gallon is being held against her.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1498" /> I believed the Department of Social Welfare operated on the basis of taking into account only the actual financial income.  Anticipating income and using that to reduce the pension of a widow is neither just nor realistic and I am confident the Minister will not support it.  If an applicant gets an income through the sale of a milk quota or any other way he or she is bound, under the conditions of the scheme, to advise the Department of that and the Department can then make the necessary adjustments.  However, I do not believe an applicant for a pension or unemployment assistance should be handicapped on the basis of anticipated income.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a point about the standard of office accommodation.  While substantial progress has been made in many cities and towns towards the provision of proper offices where applicants will be sheltered from inclement weather and have privacy when making their submissions and demands, in Killarney, where there are over 1,500 people signing, conditions are still deplorable.  This is of great concern to those who are unfortunate enough to be on the live register. People in rural Ireland trying to contact the Department in regard to various benefits are severely handicapped.  I heard a member of the Minister's party clamouring for free telephone services for such people because of the expense of getting from the west to Castlebar or any of the other offices within the time limit laid down.  Frequently the outcome of attempts at contact is not satisfactory because the particular office does not have the expertise to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is finalised and the increases are paid incomes and allowances will still be inadequate.  We have the basic problem of redistributing the wealth of the country to ensure that the least well off have the benefit of a realistic income.  I will conclude by saying that we will be submitting a substantial number of amendments to the Bill and pressing the Minister to make some changes to alleviate the continuing hardship of those on social welfare.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this very important issue.  The hallmark of a caring society and, dare I say it in these days of liberalism and <i>laissez-faire</i>, of a Christian society is how it treats its underprivileged, the less well off members of that society.  We in Ireland can hold our heads high when we compare how we treat our less well off and our elderly with how the less well off are treated in any other country of the developed world.  It would be foolish to say we are doing enough because where there is need and people are in difficulty there is room for improvement.  Unfortunately, there are constraints; we have finite resources.  The funds are not available to the Government in the amounts that everybody would like.  Any caring Government or Minister would like to give more to those who are not in a position to provide for themselves by providing housing, schooling and anything else that is necessary.  If we look at our resources and at what is being provided we will see that the Government are doing a very fine job.</P>
      <P>There are many positive aspects to the social welfare system in operation. Improvements over the last number of years have been enormous.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a report which indicates that a majority of the people of Europe, including a majority of Irish people, favour a European Defence Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to Eurobarometer <Col N="1500" /> survey No. 34, for October 1990, carried out on behalf of the Commission of the European Communities.  The survey refers to the response to a question about the possibility of the European Community, as a political union, being responsible for a common policy in matters of security and defence.  The reported response indicated that a majority of the sample in Ireland replied &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>However, it is to be noted, first, that the concepts of security and defence were grouped together in the question and that security was separated from foreign policy, about which there was a separate question; and, secondly, that in response to another question, 68 per cent of those questioned in Ireland indicated that they believed policy on security and defence should be decided by the national Government, as compared to 27 per cent who believed it should be decided jointly within the EC.  These reported responses are contradictory.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union is, pursuant to the remit set out in the Presidency conclusions of the meeting of the European Council in Rome on 14-15 December 1990, considering, <i>inter alia</i>, the question of a common foreign and security policy for such a union.  Ireland is participating fully in the discussions in the conference.  A wide variety of proposals in regard to aspects of a common foreign and security policy have been tabled and are being considered by the conference which is still at an early stage.  In fact, it would be premature, at this stage, to speculate on the eventual outcome.  The Government's objective is to ensure that Ireland will be able, as a full and active member of the Community, to participate in and contribute to the Community's foreign and security policy on a basis that respects our long-standing policy positions.</P>

      <P>We have debated these issues in this House.  The most important contribution on this whole issue was made by me at the Rome Summit when the remit for the guidelines for the Inter-governmental Conference on Political Union were being laid down, when I succeeded in having included in those guidelines the special regard for Ireland's position.  I already explained that fully to the House when I reported on that European Council meeting in Rome of 14/15 December 1990.  The conclusions there distinguished between security as a whole and defence matters.  What I reported to the House on that occasion was that, with a view to the future, we say that the prospect of a role for the union in defence matters should be considered without prejudice to member states' existing obligations and without prejudice to the traditional positions of other member states.  That most important statement made by the Community in regard to political union is included in the conclusions of the Rome Summit and was reported fully by me to this House.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not acknowledge that it is, in fact, a misnomer to say that this is a direct grant from the Government?  The Government have not given anything directly.  Does he not acknowledge that there are Shaw societies throughout the length and breadth of the world and that if Shaw's birthplace was in any other country it would be restored on the lines of Abbotsford for Scott, Windermere for Wordsworth or the Bronte parsonage and that it should be tackled as a matter of urgency even if it means making money available from the national lottery?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>I consider that extracting the very detailed information requested would serve no useful public purpose, would mean deferring more pressing and urgent work in the Offices of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor and cannot be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Questions Nos. 5 and 6, <Col N="1510" /> I have no functional responsibility for constitutional cases brought before the courts, including, in particular, cases referred to the Supreme Court by the President under Article 26, or for the number or recording of determinations in such cases.  The courts are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions subject only to the Constitution and the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying that the Government are unaware of the number of court cases in effect involving the State in the last ten to 15 years, is unaware of the advice they received regarding those court cases, is unaware as to whether public moneys were unneccessarily spent defending what are undefendable court cases?  Is the Taoiseach saying that none of this information is available or is not worth pursuing or investigating?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the view that a substantial number of court cases in which the Taoiseach is nominally named as defendant or in which the Attorney General acts for the State, are brought against the State, cases which proceed to the High Court and the Supreme Court?  Is he aware, too, that the State is constantly defending the undefendable and that as a result considerable personal difficulties are caused to the people bringing those cases while substantial unnecessary funds are lost to the State by way of legal costs?  Can the Taoiseach re-examine the way in which the State, through the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Attorney General's office, approaches litigation and deals with litigation matters?</P>

      <P>That is a different matter.

      <P>Arising from the discussion on this issue so far, does the Taoiseach now accept that there is a case for a review?  It has been suggested that hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers money may have been wasted defending cases which should not have been defended.  The only way to prove or disprove this is by reviewing the situation. Will the Taoiseach now confirm that he will have such a review undertaken with a view to establishing a policy for the future which will ensure that there will be no such wastage?</P>

      <P>Tuigim ó Údarás na Gaeltachta gur íocadh £20,300 le Stokes Kennedy Crowley ach níor íocadh aon airgead le RTE as an gcomhairle theicniúil a chur siad ar fáil.  Fuarthas deontas 30,000 ECU (£23,000 nó mar sin) ón gComhphobal Eorpach mar chabhair chun cuid den chostas a ghlanadh.  D'fhéadfaí luach a chur ar an obair a rinne feidhmeannaigh an Údaráis leis, ar ndóigh.</P>

      <P>An nglacann an tAire Stáit leis go bhfuil an costas iomlán a bhaineann leis an tuarascáil faoi theilifís Ghaeltachta chomh hard le £70,000? Agus má tá £70,000 caite ar an tuarascáil agus más rud é go bhfuil sé ag Aire na Gaeltachta, an Taoiseach, ó mhí Mheán Fómhair 1989, cad é an stádas atá ag baint leis an tuarascáil faoi láthair, mar shampla, i gcomhréir leis an meamram gearr a cuireadh isteach chuig Roinn na Gaeltachta le déanaí ag beirt neamhspleácha?</P>

Chomh maith leis sin caithfear costas a chur ar an méid a rinne feidhmeannaigh Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Mar sin, is dócha gur féidir a rá go raibh costas thart ar £60,000 air seo agus go bhfuaireamar deontas £20,000.  Maidir le stádas na tuarascála, nior iarr an Taoiseach ar Údarás na Gaeltachta tuarascáil a chur ar fáil; d'iarr sé moltaí uatha.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 13, 24 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 1990 Telecom Éireann submitted proposals for a revised tariff <Col N="1522" /> system for certain telephone charges. Since my appointment as Minister with responsibility for communications, I have spent some time studying Telecom's proposals.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware it is not the practice to give details of proposals from State bodies to Government Departments. However, I am prepared to indicate the broad areas covered by the proposals.  They include: reducing some truck call charges, reducing cellular phone charges, reducing the local unitcall fee, introduction of local call timing, expansion of provincial local call areas and changes in operator and pay phone charges.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of my view that Telecom charges are too high and must come down, and for that reason I am engaged in a very thorough examination of the proposals.  I am not convinced of the appropriateness of certain aspects of the proposals.  I hope to complete my examination of the proposals quickly and I expect to be in a position to make a decision on the proposals in a few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  In the course of his examination will he pay particular attention to several aspects including the social and household aspects, as well as commercial attitudes to Telecom Éireann?  Will he bear in mind that this is one of the most profitable commercial organisations in the country?  They made £79 million last year and it is predicted they will make at least £100 million this year.  Will the Minister bear in mind, too, that internal and international charges here are higher than in most countries in the European Community and that the proposal in particular to have timed local charges will have serious consequences for the old, the disadvantaged, the sick, the handicapped and people in those categories?  It will also have serious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but I must dissuade him from putting questions in an omnibus form of this nature.  Could we have a <Col N="1523" /> little brevity in the matter?  Too many questions have been put together.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much, a Cheann Comhairle, for your advice.  As you know I am new to the job and your advice is always welcome.  I will conclude by asking if the Minister is aware of the serious consequences of timed charges for organisations which look after the sick, the disadvantaged and such people? Are we not talking here in terms of efforts being made to prepare this company for privatisation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a question down later about privatisation. As I said in my reply, I am not convinced of the appropriateness of certain aspects of the proposals, including the one the Deputy mentioned.  I will be studying the matter very carefully and I will of course take into account all the points mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice in the Minister's original reply that he put much emphasis on reduction and expansion.  If there is to be so much good news in the report when it eventually comes out can the Minister explain why it sat on the desk of his predecessor since the middle of August last?  In view of what we know of his predecessor and if there is so much good news in the report in terms of reduction and expansion, why did he not take the opportunity to make those announcements at that time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I would jog his memory to the extent that as far back as April 1990 people in An Post were talking about haemorrhaging in relation to their financial position.  In February 1991 when the viability plan came out, phrases such as &ldquo;serious financial crisis&rdquo; and &ldquo;requiring immediate action&rdquo; were used.  I would remind the Minister that when, on the day after his appointment, he referred in this House to the matter, he talked about unsustainable financial losses requiring urgent action and said this crisis could not be allowed continue.  I would also remind him that in reply to a Dáil question from me on 22 February last he said there would be an NESC study within a period of six months.  Will the Minister tell us why there has been a change of mind? Why, since words such as &ldquo;urgent attention&rdquo;, &ldquo;haemorrhaging,&rdquo;&ldquo;crisis&rdquo; and &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; were being used at that time, did the Minister suddenly find that the matter was not quite so urgent after all and that decisions could be left over&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I repeat that the matter is still urgent, and I stand over my statement in the House on that day.  The crisis cannot be allowed continue.  There is a serious financial situation in An Post and it is urgent.  In reply to another part of the Deputy's question, the two matters I have referred to NESC are matters which in my view do not account for a substantial proportion of the financial situation.  I would be happy at some stage to outline to the Deputy the sums if he <Col N="1525" /> so wishes.  Urgent negotiations will take place between the unions and the management on the other major issues such as the position in the city and the whole position in regard to pay, which is the nub of the problem in many ways.  I think we were wise to refer these matters to NESC.</P>

Will the Minister come clean and admit that the real reason for this delay is the imminence of the local government elections?  Backbenchers particularly in the Minister's party refuse to face the electorate in view of the proposals that have been made?  Surely this is a matter of political expediency and of refusing to look the truth in the face?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 15, 17, 47, 48, 58 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>On 20 February 1991 I announced that the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) were being invited to conduct a study of two aspects of An Post's proposals to return the company to profitability.  On 25 February I formally sought NESC's assistance in conducting the study.  The broad terms of reference for the study are to assess the socio-economic implications for rural communities of An Post's proposals for the closure of a large number of sub-post offices and the provision of roadside letter boxes, including an examination of alternative possibilities for increased revenue at the sub-post offices, hardship alleviating measures and other options.  The intention is that the study would be completed, if possible, within a period of six months.</P>
      <P>The main reason I decided to approach NESC was that the council are a forum for the discussion of the principles relating to the efficient development of the national economy and the achievement of social justice and I considered that they would be a valuable source of advice in regard to the social implications for rural communities of these two proposals of An Post.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment NESC on the speedy and positive way in which they responded to my request.  They have set out the principles which should apply to the study of An Post proposals as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, in view of the importance of the <Col N="1528" /> efficient operation of commercial State-sponsored bodies, such as An Post, there should be full transparency of the financial flows between the State and State owned companies.  This required the separate identification of the commercial and social functions of public enterprises, such as An Post, with the financial cost of pursuing the relevant social objectives explicitly identified in the accounts.  The council consider that it is important that the social objectives are explicitly costed at the outset of the accounting period rather than equated with the financial shortfall at the end.</P>
    <P>Second, the council have recommended that current public expenditure should not increase in real terms in the period up to 1993.  This forms an integral part of the strategy for economic development which the council have proposed for the decade ahead.  Accordingly, if the case is made for the subsidisation of the activities of the commercial State-sponsored bodies to pursue a social objective, or if agencies such as the Department of Social Welfare are to secure a particular level of service from a State-sponsored body such as An Post, the cost of such subsidies or services should be met within the constraints of that strategic approach to public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Third, there is a need for co-ordinated planning for both agricultural and rural development, seen as separate but related objectives.  The council consider that, while the disadvantages of remoteness cannot be completely removed, nonetheless the provision of appropriate communication facilities and social services, geared to the needs of people living in remote areas, has a high priority in a social policy perspective.  In general, such an approach would require intensive area based studies to examine the possibilities for closer co-ordination of the services provided in rural areas, as a background for formulating more broadly based strategies. The general theme of rural development is one to which the council propose to return in their future work programme.</P>
    <P>I will be arranging as a matter of <Col N="1529" /> urgency for the undertaking of the study based on the principles set out by NESC. NESC will be available to advise on an ongoing basis on any problems that might arise in applying the principles.  An Post's proposals will be further reviewed in the light of the findings of the study.</P>
    <P>I do not see need for a further specific study of the remaining aspects of An Post's recovery proposals or of the entire operations of the company which will be the subject of intensive negotiations between management and unions in the normal manner.</P>
    <P>An Post have assured me that their proposals to retitle a number of their own post offices will have no effect on the range and quality of either mails or counter services to customers.</P>
    <P>The European Commission is currently drafting a Green Paper on postal services. The paper, when finalised, will be a discussion document and will serve as a basis for the preparation of proposals for Community measures.  As there are, as yet, no formal Commission proposals in the postal area it would not be appropriate for me to express any views at this stage.  I should add that there is little, if any, prospect of EC funds being made available to meet trading losses of postal administrations.</P>

      <P>The Minister evaded the question.  There have been job losses amounting to 1,500 in An Post largely due to bad management decisions since they became a semi-State company. The workers are now expected to bear the brunt.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 43, 44, 49, 64, 71 together.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte are the lead agency for the overseas marketing and promotion of Ireland as a tourist destination.  The board's total grant-in-aid for 1991 is £21.5 million of which over £16 million will be spent on overseas marketing.</P>
      <P>There are also, of course, a whole range of organisations and companies, in the public and private sectors, who promote their services in overseas marketing. These include international carriers into Ireland, tour operators, hotel chains, accommodation providers, specialist operators, etc.  Their activities are financed from private sources or, in the case of the semi-State companies, from commercially generated resources.</P>
      <P>I might mention that the Irish Government have agreed with the EC as part of the Operational Programme for Tourism to make a total of £10 million available for marketing assistance to the private sector through the European Regional Development Fund over the four-year period 1989-93.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Minister's meeting with the organisations involved in the promotion of tourism, is he satisfied that the £21.5 million he has made available, of which £16 million will be spent in marketing, is sufficient for this <Col N="1535" /> year, taking into consideration the huge drop in the numbers coming here in the recent past?  Has he any intention of increasing the amount of money to that organisation for further promotion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  The figures are as follows; 1987, £21.9 million; 1988, £25.4 million; 1989, £21.5 million; 1990, £21.5 million; 1991, £21.5 million, including an extra £1 million in the budget plus additional ERDF funding to be matched by the private sector, which brings this year's control of expenditure by Bord Fáilte to an all-time high.  That is throughout a period when public expenditure was cut back by something like £3 billion so it is the best the country can do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on the conclusion of the Gulf <Col N="1540" /> war I met with key representatives of the Irish tourist industry in Dublin Castle on Monday, 11 March last to review prospects and consider strategy for the 1991 tourist season.  The general consensus was that prospects for 1991 had improved considerably with the early end to the war in the Gulf.  It was also accepted that there was an urgent need for an all-out, intensive effort by the industry to encourage more visitors, especially from the US.</P>
    <P>The Government, in recognition of the particular difficulties this year, have already allocated a further £1 million to Bord Fáilte in the recent budget for additional marketing and promotion in 1991. A further £4 million, in the form of ERDF grants, is being made available now to the industry for marketing assistance in co-operation with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Since hostilities have ceased in the Gulf will the Minister agree that an excellent opportunity exists for this country to increase business in the American market?  Will he undertake in the House today to make extra money available, no matter to whom, to Bord Fáilte or even Aer Lingus, who enjoy a great reputation on the American market, so that they can carry on a crash campaign of advertising to promote this country for the tourist season?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the purpose for which we have allocated and put together a package of an additional £4 million on top of the £21 million which is already in Bord Fáilte's budget.  I would like to do far better but it is a substantial increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the industry out there is not satisfied with the amount of funds they have at their disposal for the further promotion of Ireland this year?  Following his meeting with them he said he would roll up his sleeves and they would get down to business; no business at all has been done <Col N="1541" /> since then.  The people in the industry require extra funds for marketing to cope with the $12 million Britain has made available to promote Britain in America and the £6 million that Mexico has made available for promotions.  Extra funds are required by the industry to ensure that more American visitors come here this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not listening to me.  I have already allocated additional funds specifically for the purpose of relaunching the industry after the Gulf war.  I was told by Bord Fáilte as recently as a few days ago that the matching is looking very good and that our application to the EC to allow the industry to put up 25 per cent instead of 50 per cent to match it, is looking promising. We have relaunched the tourist industry and I reject the notion that nothing has happened since the meeting in Dublin Castle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing both in fact.  I have made that clear publicly on a number of occasions.  The £1 million in the budget is obviously Exchequer funding, the £2.5 million and the additional £1.5 million is marketing money made available under the ERDF to the Government to market tourism.  A portion of that has been brought from 1992 into 1991.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree, given the situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the North American market, that there is an ideal opportunity, as Dublin is the Cultural Capital of Europe this year, to push to keep the flights in the air and that the most attractive way to get North American business to Ireland is to slash the rates?  Given the projected losses on the routes, would the Minister not agree that the airline might as well fly full aircraft with the same income by reducing the fares substantially?  That would be a good PR exercise for Irish tourism.  Will the Minister agree that that could be one way forward?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a very tempting course of action for Aer Lingus &mdash; to halve their fares and hope the numbers double.  The judgment of the company is that this is not the way they wish to proceed.  They wish to recover their costs and try to get the company back into some sort of profitability.  The Deputy has touched a chord because one thing I learned during my recent few days in the US was that the UK and American airlines are launching a massive discount fare campaign this summer, to airlift people from the US directly to London. <Col N="1543" /> They are offering fares which are staggeringly low.  This is a cause of great concern for our airlines and I am genuinely concerned about it.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1991: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is positive evidence of the foresight of the Government and the Minister with relation to social welfare recipients.  It is a continuation of the enlightened approach of the Government since 1987 and of the improvements in benefits since then.</P>
      <P>There has been a general increase of 4 per cent in all short-term payments and in health board payments.  This increase is in excess of the increase in the rate of inflation.  In the past four years there have been special increases of up to 11 per cent for those on the lowest level of payments. In 1986, for example, the personal rate of long-term unemployment assistance was £36.70 a week.  From July next it will be £55 a week, an increase of just under 50 per cent.  If in 1982 somebody said that by 1986 there would be a 50 per cent increase in unemployment assistance nobody would have believed it.  It did not happen.  Since 1987 we have increased benefits by up to 50 per cent and at the same time kept inflation to single figures. Therefore, there has been a real increase for the recipients of benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government not only on giving these increases but on their continual support of the family.  There is a new minimum allowance of £12 per week for child <Col N="1675" /> dependants and there will be a higher rate of child benefit from the fourth child onwards.  The Government have also streamlined the child dependant rates, reducing the number of rates from 36 four years ago to four rates now.  This means that claims can be processed more quickly.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance seems to have caused some concern in recent months. The introduction of this allowance was a most progressive step and up to 4,000 people now benefit from it.  It was introduced only in November 1990 and many people on the other side of the House have described it as a fiasco.  It is plain that they do not understand what they are talking about.  The allowance is meant to cover people who were not in receipt of any social welfare benefit.  Many women left their employment to look after aged parents and when their entitlement to unemployment assistance expired they did not qualify for any other payments because they were not available for work. The Minister introduced the carer's allowance in recognition of the need. Some commentators misrepresented the allowance and caused great confusion. The fact that 4,000 people are benefiting from this allowance is clear evidence that its introduction was a wise decision.  As time goes on many more will benefit.</P>
    <P>Many people were at a disadvantage because of the lack of social insurance for part-time workers.  We have been given figures by the Department which say that up to 21,000 long term part-time workers were not in a position to receive any social welfare benefits whatsoever, that they were outside the social welfare system.  Under this new scheme they will be eligible for social welfare pension and unemployment benefit etc.  However, it is quite clear that there are unscrupulous employers who will try everything to circumvent the legislation.  I note that there is to be an income threshold of £40 per week in order to qualify but I would ask the Minister to reduce this to £30 or perhaps less, as a maximum.  That would <Col N="1676" /> prevent unscrupulous employers from circumventing the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will know what to do.  We have had to wait for Fianna Fáil to introduce this legislation.  The provision of social insurance for part-time workers and the introduction of a carer's allowance go to show that Fianna Fáil have been the party to see the need, as always, in the community and to respond to that need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Another welcome element of the Bill is the introduction of an adult dependant and child dependant allowance for six weeks after the death of a spouse or a child.  The weeks after the death of a loved one are very traumatic.  It is also a time when people do not take account of what they spend and it can be a time of great expense.  Many people get into great debt at such times so I am glad that the Minister and the Government saw fit to introduce this allowance.  I am confident that it will be of great benefit to people in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another headline over the past number of weeks is that some people are better off in receipt of social welfare as opposed to being at work.  This may have <Col N="1677" /> been true in the past but, with the introduction of the family income supplement and family tax exemptions over the past year or two, it is no longer the case.  With exemptions on income up to £8,000 and family income supplement payments of anything up to £25 per week it is definitely, and this has been proved in figures given by the Department of Social Welfare and the tax office, that people are better off at work than depending on social welfare.  Besides the financial aspect, the psychological impact of not working is not beneficial.  Various social welfare schemes have enabled people to go back to work and to provide psychologically and financially for their families.</P>
    <P>Another scaremongering tactic from the Opposition benches was that people in receipt of the family income supplement would not qualify for a medical card.  Of course this is not true.  Any such notion should be put to bed.  A person may hold a medical card as well as receiving a family income supplement payment.</P>
    <P>An important innovation in the Bill is that people on long-term unemployment payments will be allowed to take up jobs for up to a year without adversely affecting their benefit.  One of the problems facing those on long-term unemployment was that if they were offered short-term jobs they would lose out on their extra entitlements.  I am glad the Minister has seen fit to change this regulation.  A person who has the offer of a job for a couple of months will be in a position to accept it while retaining the right to go back on long-term unemployment assistance or benefit and receive the extra entitlements.  This is very important for the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the change in the payment of pensions to the payment of a <i>pro rata</i> pension to people with mixed insurance, an area I have been concerned about for a long time.  Many people fail to qualify for old age contributory and retirement pensions because of their mixed insurance record.  However, with the changes in this Bill they will now qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension.  This is most welcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> The new appeals procedure should be of great benefit to those appealing decisions in the years ahead.  A problem I have had in dealing with the Department of Social Welfare over the years, especially in regard to appeals, is that I was unable to get any information.  I hope this new system will allow people to get information as to why their appeal was turned down, and that they will get more information than was ever the case before.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about the means testing of relatives, whether they be sons, daughters, or brothers and sisters, for example, where a boy is living with his sister and brother-in-law, the means of the brother-in-law and his wife are taken into account when assessing the means of the boy.  I request the Minister to examine this position.  I have had cases where young men of 17 or 18 years were living with a married sister and husband and did not qualify for assistance because their means were taken into consideration. This question should be examined seriously.</P>
    <P>Referring social welfare cases to referees has caused great concern down through the years.  There have been improvements in this area but it should be carefully monitored.  Anyone appearing before the referee should be treated with dignity and respect.  Unfortunately, people report that this is not always the case so I request the Minister to ensure that the matter is kept under close scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that social welfare premises and facilities have been improved throughout the country. However, there is room for further improvement.  I know the Minister and the Government are doing their best in that respect and I wish them well.</P>
    <P>I had been dealing with the Department of Social Welfare for many years before coming into this House.  The improvements that have been made in the past number of years must be commended. These improvements are due to the excellent work being done by the Government, the Minister and the staff in the Department.  Social welfare is a <Col N="1679" /> complicated area and without the hard work and excellent effort of all we would not have achieved results.  The number of queries I have received in the last year or so has reduced compared with that of four years ago.  Information from the Department shows that the number of queries from Deputies has gone down over the years.  This improvement is due to computerisation and a better awareness on the part of the general public.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 the lot of those dependent on the State has improved because the Minister has fought hard at Cabinet level to get the necessary finances to give greater funding to those in need.  Thanks is due also to the Government for recognising the need to give support to the less well off in our society.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish the Minister well and congratulate him on introducing such an excellent Bill.</P>

This is regrettable in the case of such important legislation affecting so many people.  I would also like to ask the Minister &mdash; and perhaps other Ministers will take note of this as well &mdash; to circulate his speech to Deputies.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is to give effect to social welfare provisions in the budget.  It is an annual exercise to change, and increase in some instances, amounts to people on social welfare payments.  It should also <Col N="1680" /> be an opportunity for Ministers to initiate new policies or structures, to amend the system of social welfare, to improve it as proposed, for instance, in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986.  This Bill has not done this and is one more lost opportunity.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the recommendations of the commission.  Their recommendation on child welfare, or children's allowance as it was called, is worthwhile.  It proposes that children's allowances now at £15.80 per child for the first three children, with higher amounts for subsequent children, should be amended to give a higher rate to children age 12 and over because the cost of clothing, feeding and looking after older children is substantially higher than that for small children.  It is certainly more expensive and should be mirrored in the payments.</P>
    <P>The commission also recommended changes in the family income supplement. They say it should be discontinued in the long term in favour of higher children's allowances and realistic marginal tax rates on low paid employees.  It is a most difficult scheme. It is almost impossible to interpret and apply.  Only a proportion of those who need it or who could qualify for it are getting it.  Maybe it is time to consider the commission's proposals seriously and make the necessary amendments.  There is no doubt of the need.  The delivery of such a payment to people needs to be clarified and streamlined.</P>
    <P>The commission are interesting on the supplementary welfare allowance.  This has come up time and again.  The allowance is at present administered by health boards on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The commission proposed it should be dealt with by the Department of Social Welfare directly and that there should be clear guidelines which should be reviewed every two years.  Many speakers recount humiliating experiences of people seeking supplementary welfare allowances. All of these people are very vulnerable, very needy, very deserving.  Yet at that time in their lives they can be treated quite abominably by some officials &mdash; I <Col N="1681" /> say some officials, not all, but some cases of very bad treatment have been reported to me.  Some measures to make this scheme fair and seen to be fair are long overdue.</P>
    <P>There are many other worthwhile proposals which the commission have made and on which action is needed.  These would improve the general social welfare service but, unfortunately, they have been ignored.  It is time we took the report of the Commission on Social Welfare more seriously.</P>
    <P>I welcome the European Court decision that proved a victory for two women, Anne Cotter and Nora McDermott. This has enormous implications for the Government.</P>

      <P>We have had a recurring problem in respect of this case in so far as it is still before our courts. We are not, here, going to argue the wisdom or otherwise of the prohibition that exists in the matter of not discussing such cases.  A passing reference is acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish them well, and all the other women, too, who I hope will benefit.  This Bill will now recognise, for social welfare purposes, people living in non-marital relationships.  Such couples will, in future, be treated as man and wife.  When I heard this proposal I wondered what wonderful rush of blood to the head was now bringing official policy into line with reality.  I wondered was it an awareness of the new social order that is here to stay, an acknowledgment that people are deciding not to marry, many of them from choice, others because they have had a legal marriage and cannot get a divorce and so have to make their own casual arrangements.  However, I find the change is not due to any of those worthy motives but to the plain hard economics that too single people living together were getting higher benefits than a married couple.  The Department were, in fact, losing out financially and, rather than increasing the allowances to married <Col N="1682" /> people as one would have thought more appropriate, it was decided to treat single people as married.  Perhaps some good can come of that.</P>
      <P>Now that we have this decision under social welfare legislation, can we hope for a similar bolt of enlightenment on the part of the Minister for Finance in his Bill?  Will he now extend the same facility that the Minister for Social Welfare is extending to couples living together for tax purposes and for mortgage relief? Can we look even further ahead and get the Minister for Justice to take another lead and reflect on how Irish society has developed and how many non-marital families now exist with the same needs for protection, the same needs for recognition as families based on marriage and extend our family laws to protect all families, give them all the same rights and entitlements in the areas of maintenance, custody, family homes etc?  This is a serious question.  I certainly hope that the trend that has been started in this Bill will be continued in other legislation.  Where our laws distinguish between families, depending on whether couples are married or are cohabiting, they are unjust and need to be reviewed and changed.  I am surprised that somewhere along the way there has not been a constitutional challenge to these provisions because it would be difficult to imagine any such challenge failing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will turn now to the carer's allowance mentioned by almost all speakers in this debate.  I welcomed its introduction. Over the years we had made submissions to various Ministers recommending that its structure be changed, so that the carer would benefit rather than the person who was handicapped, old or infirm.  That has been done but, unfortunately, this long promised allowance has not proved to be as ideal as one might have expected.  That is most regrettable.  It is unhelpful to the main carers, mostly women, who care for our elderly, handicapped and ill, who are doing an extremely good job at tremendous cost to themselves with very little respite in the way of help, holidays or other relief.  Many of them looked <Col N="1683" /> forward to receiving some small allowance or income that would not fully recognise the task they were undertaking but would go some way towards doing so.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Connaughton pointed out, any family with an earned income in excess of £90 a week is debarred totally from receiving this allowance.  That is most regrettable.  Probably 99.9 per cent of those carers are comprised of women who provide a quality of care not to be found elsewhere.  We must remember that they save the State a lot of money, for example, at least £300 per week if an old person in their care had to be accommodated in a nursing home.  They also help to keep communities together, which is very important in a social sense, preventing the break-up of families and the awful loneliness and subsequent illness of many old people when removed from their homes.  These women are doing an enormously important job.  I would appeal to the Minister to listen to the very real concerns expressed inside and outside this House, to examine this allowance and, if necessary, to amend it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the problems encountered by women who were compelled to give up their jobs on marriage prior to 1973 when the marriage bar obtained for women in public service jobs.  They could not, by law, continue to work after marriage and left the labour force.  Many have returned to work, others are still returning, and find they will be at a great loss when it comes to a pension being paid.  They have been placed at a disadvantage for pension purposes because their work contribution to benefit will be calculated <i>pro rata</i> on their broken work record.  That was not their fault; they were left no discretion in the matter.  This is something that should be rectified by the Government.  I know that these women's cases have been documented and presented to the Minister.  I would ask him to look favourably at their claim and table an amendment referring to them specifically.</P>
    <P>I have noted the amnesty for <Col N="1684" /> employers forming part of the PRSI-related fraud crackdown which will last for six months.  It is very distressing to come across anybody who has been sacked or lost their job because their firm or business has gone into liquidation, closed down or whatever, when they discover they have no entitlement to anything because their PRSI contributions have been used by their employers as a type of long term loan.  I feel very strongly about this practice by such employers.  I would contend that stronger measures than an amnesty should be initiated to ensure that this practice cannot continue, which is anti-taxpayer and specifically anti-worker.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise one other matter with the Minister of which he may not be aware.  It has come to my notice that an unemployed man, anxious to be a candidate in the local elections &mdash; who has indicated his intention to the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; has been told that, if selected, will be deemed to be not available for work and will have his unemployment assistance payments terminated.  It is good that somebody who has experienced first-hand the deprivations of being unemployed is attempting to represent a constituency and run as a candidate in the local elections.  That decision of the Department is most regrettable.  I am sure that our party will not be the only one that will have unemployed candidates running in the local elections.  I am sure other parties will also.  I would ask the Minister to examine this and ascertain whether something can be done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair.  We have not had local elections now for five years so we should be somewhat more enlightened about such matters.  I would ask the Minister to examine the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to commend the Minister on his information campaign, particularly on the very clear and helpful way his Departmental officials deal with queries.  I want to commend him particularly on the series of information sheets produced <Col N="1685" /> which go a long way to helping people become aware of their entitlements. When I was Minister I did this kind of thing; I had a budget and was able to do so.  The good aspect of it is that such information sheets are distributed free of charge, all helping to give people greater dignity, and making them more aware of their entitlements so that, hopefully, fewer of them will resort to public representatives to make representations on their behalf.  Indeed, it would be my wish that this help on the part of his Department would percolate down the line nationwide to all their offices and so on which, unfortunately, is not the case.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the HIV trust fund has been recognised in this Bill and that there will be an exemption limit for those people who at present suffer from AIDS, are HIV-positive or haemophiliacs.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister also on the scheme with regard to women's organisations whose provisions go a great deal further than its allocations.  Women's organisations, by way of community support, are enormously cost effective in that they do not spend money on big cars, large offices or whatever; their money is spent in the most economical, advantageous way possible.</P>
    <P>I might mention one group &mdash; called AIM &mdash; with which most people in the House will be familiar who appear to fall between all stools.  They provide an advice centre, mainly for women experiencing problems <i>vis-á-vis</i> family breakdown. This group has been turned down by everybody, by the national lottery, and, as far as I am aware, by the Department. I am asking the Minister to look kindly on them because they are about to close having had such bad luck in endeavouring to get any funding.  I am aware &mdash; as I am sure is the Minister &mdash; that their work is much appreciated.  I hope that the Minister will indeed look favourably at the submission I will make to him in regard to this group.</P>
    <P>I also hope that we will have longer to debate the Social Welfare Bill of next year when, hopefully, more of the recommendations of the Commission <Col N="1686" /> on Social Welfare will have been implemented because, in the long run, they constitute the most important aspect of our work with regard to social welfare in its entirety.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their fairly lengthy contributions.  I have noted the very large number of points made and I would like to assure Deputies that I will give them every consideration. In the time available to me I will be able to deal only with a number of them but I will try to cover as many as I can.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I want to refer to a matter raised by Deputy Byrne.  I was very glad that he raised, yet again, the matter of the poverty conference in Galway which I had the honour to host during Ireland's Presidency.  I have already made the facts about the conference very clear but I will repeat them for the benefit of the House.</P>
      <P>The theme of the conference was the role of voluntary organisations in the member states of the EC.  It was held during the Irish Presidency and was partly funded by the EC.  It was particularly appropriate that this conference should be held in Ireland in view of the exceptionally high level of our voluntary services. We are unique in Europe in the extent, commitment and calibre of our voluntary organisations and the people who run them and participate in them. The conference was attended by 150 representatives mainly from voluntary organisations from the various member states, as well as government representatives, representatives of the European Commission, the Council of Europe and other international organisations representing the voluntary sector.  The conference was extremely valuable to me in the context of the development of policy in relation to the voluntary sector, with particular reference to the relationship between the State and voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already announced plans to draw up a charter for voluntary social <Col N="1687" /> service activities in Ireland.  The new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commits the Government to produce a White Paper outlining their proposals in this area.  The conference was also extremely valuable at EC level and was recognised by the Commission as having put the issue of voluntary organisations and their role clearly on the EC agenda, the role of the nongovernmental organisations, as they are called in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We suggested Galway as a suitable venue because many of the meetings were taking place here in Dublin.  Obviously, holding the meeting in Galway would cost more &mdash; that is the nature of holding conferences outside Dublin.  It is very important that a number of them should be held outside Dublin.  Galway was a very suitable location for the conference which was held in the Great Southern Hotel.  I was delighted to be able to have the conference in the west.  In addition, it gave the delegates the opportunity to visit the Forum Project in Letterfrack, Connemara, which will receive a total of £1.7 million funding from the third EC poverty programme.  It is one of the two major programmes covered in Ireland under this scheme.  Over half of the overall costs involved related to organising the conference itself, including printing and interpretation facilities.  In addition, as is normal for such conferences, the air and other travel costs of all delegates were met.  That is normal for EC conferences and is normal when they are held in Ireland, although I know Deputy Byrne does not want it to be normal if it is a conference relating to social security, social welfare or the voluntary organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I gave the House an undertaking that if employers attempted to reduce hours of work or wages to bring employees' weekly earnings down to exclude employees from full insurance cover, I would not hesitate to take action.  Last Friday, strong representations were made to me by both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, a joint delegation of SIPTU and representatives of the contract cleaning industry.  Both delegations indicated that unscrupulous employers were prepared to reduce employees' earnings below the £40 threshold and that, in some cases, this process had already begun.  As this will have the effect of excluding from cover part-time employees, who are particularly vulnerable, I have decided to take corrective action.  Accordingly, I am reducing the threshold for insurability from £40 to £25 or more per week.  I am satisfied that employers who attempt to do so will find it extremely difficult to reduce hours of employment or pay to bring their employees below this reduced level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence of this development, the number of part-time employees who will benefit from the full insurance cover will increase from 21,000 to 27,000.  I am confident that the £25 threshold will reduce the scope for evasion and the effect of the black economy.  There is clear evidence that people are already making preparations to try to evade the £40 threshold which I had set.  It is vital that families who live on low incomes and who rely heavily on income from part-time work are given the security of the social welfare system to fall back on at times when they are unable to work.  I am satisfied that the £25 threshold will achieve this aim.  As a consequence, the number of part-time employees who will benefit will go up to 27,000.  For the first time these workers will have access to social security benefits when they are unable <Col N="1691" /> to work because of illness, maternity or unemployment.  Furthermore, they will be entitled to pensions on retirement.</P>
    <P>Part-time workers are the last group to be brought into the protection of the social insurance system.  These workers are usually women who work in traditionally low paid and often insecure employment.  I am satisfied that the new development in relation to the threshold will succeed in protecting these workers.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to incentives to work.  One cannot take in isolation the different items in relation to incentives to work.  A number of elements in this Bill and the budget are designed specifically to increase the incentive to work on the one hand and, on the other, ensure that there is adequate support for those at work, particularly those on lower pay.  The extension of the linking period of unemployment assistance from 20 to 52 weeks will be a major incentive for those on long-term unemployment assistance to seek out job opportunities.  In addition, the full social insurance cover which will be extended from 6 April next to part-time workers will also facilitate those who avail of this 52 week break. Apart from directly assisting part-time employees this will also assist those who are unemployed in getting back into employment.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies spoke about child benefit in isolation.  However, child benefit and child-related tax exemptions have to be taken together.  The strategy in the budget was to give the extra money to areas where it would have the greatest impact.  It is clear that the increases in the family income supplement and the improvements in the child-related tax exemptions will have the greatest impact on people at work on low pay.  The combination of the increased child-related tax incentives, family income supplement and child benefit will make a very significant contribution to the incentive to work.  For example, a married person with four children earning £162 per week will get an extra £13.80 per week as a result of the combined effect of child <Col N="1692" /> benefit, family income supplement and child-related tax incentives.</P>
    <P>The new area-based response to long-term employment set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is a further initiative specifically designed to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment in black spot areas. It will ensure that a range of options will be available to the long-term unemployed resulting in a greater possibility of employment.  We have been doing a number of things which fit in with this initiative.  As regards the community development programme, Deputy Wallace referred to Knocknaheeney and Mayfield in Cork.  There are some very good examples in these areas of how people have made use of this programme which is designed to help people get back into courses of different kinds and start up work projects.  We are not confined solely to the new area-based response, details of which will be made available shortly.  The community development programme has made a valuable contribution to local groups in helping them tackle their problems at local level.  I am delighted that a total allocation of £750,000 has been made available this year for this programme.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about the need for a more personalised and localised service.  That is the way in which we are developing the programme at present.  For example, we are improving our buildings and offices and giving greater autonomy to regions and local managers.  The increased autonomy which will be devolved to the regions and local managers will enable a number of the other initiatives referred to by Deputies to be introduced.  We will continue to introduce one-stop-shops and to improve local information services.  On the other side of the coin, we are tackling fraud and abuse, something we believe we must do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerry Reynolds referred to the external control unit.  He was very concerned about this unit and their activities.  In this context, I took exception to some of the words he used in regard to public servants.  He was not <Col N="1693" /> prepared to withdraw his remarks but I hope he will do so in due course.  I want to put the record straight in regard to the activities of the external control unit.</P>
    <P>The external control unit visit people who are receiving postal payments, who sign on at Garda stations and other signing offices.  These people do not sign on weekly and some of them have not seen anyone for years, not to mention weeks or months.  The external control unit arrange interviews locally and meet those people who are signing on for unemployment payments.  They give these people a simple form to fill in.  This was presented in a totally different light by Deputy Gerry Reynolds.  I want to refer to the simplicity of the form and how it is related to the legislation.  It states:</P>
    <P>I understand that I must inform my local employment exchange or office if:</P>
    <P>(1) I engage in any work, paid or unpaid, regardless of the duration,</P>
    <P>(2) I am unable for any reason to take up employment,</P>
    <P>(3) I am accepted on a training course given by FÁS, an Enterprise Allowance Scheme, the Social Employment Scheme, or any other Government sponsored training or work programme,</P>
    <P>(4) I apply for any other benefit, assistance or allowance,</P>
    <P>(5) I start a course of education,</P>
    <P>(6) I am absent from the State for any period, and</P>
    <P>(7) there are any changes in family circumstances which might affect my benefits, for example, a spouse taking up employment or dependants going to live elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The form is then signed by the person. That is all that is in the form.  Those who sign on weekly at employment exchanges or social welfare offices are very much aware of the requirements and from time to time are asked if they are still fulfilling them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1694" /> To give an example of how the external control unit operate, I will refer to their activities during 1990.  Even though they are a very small unit, they interviewed 19,513 people during 1990.  The number of people who, having either seen the form or filled it in, voluntarily signed off was 4,796.  The number of people disallowed &mdash; the people referred to by Deputy Gerry Reynolds &mdash; was 292 out of a total of 19,513.  I want to make it very clear that the allegations made by Deputy Reynolds are untrue, unfounded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope people will come forward, come clean, make arrangements with officers of my Department to have their affairs brought up-to-date and pay what they owe to avoid prosecution.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it very clear that the number of investigations into employers will increase very significantly.  Last year, 2,400 employers were visited but, by the end of this year, 15,000 employers will have been visited.  We are doing no more than Deputies have asked.  They have asked us to redirect our efforts away from cases where very small sums are involved, a matter of a few pounds, to areas where there is sizeable evasion.  As well as this, additional staff have been appointed.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the carer's allowance.  I want us to be clear about one thing.  That was the first time a carer's allowance was introduced.  We made it very clear both in this House and in advertisements that only those on low incomes could avail of the allowance.</P>

We are increasing the allowance from £45 to £50 and intend to extend the scheme to cover those in receipt of the DPMA, disabled person's maintenance allowance.  What is the first priority of the Labour Party, The Workers' Party or the Fine Gael Party? When the Deputy spoke honestly he suggested that our next priority must be an extension of the scheme to cover those in receipt of the disabled persons maintenance allowance.  We are now doing that and in the future, will improve the means test.  Reading from a prepared script &mdash; this was not allowed at one stage <Col N="1697" /> here; one could only refer to one's notes but this practice seems to have gone by the board &mdash; Deputy Moynihan raised the question of this allowance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>During the break I had to clear a number of parliamentary questions put down for answer today.  One of those was a question put down by Deputy Moynihan, Question No. 159 which reads:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Social Welfare if he will outline the grounds on which a person (details supplied) in County Kerry was refused a transfer from a prescribed relative allowance to a carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>I stated in reply that the carer's allowance is only payable to carers on low income who are living with and looking after a social welfare pensioner who needs full time care and attention.  In this instance, the prescribed relative allowance of the person concerned was transferred to her son in the form of a carer's allowance with effect from 8 November 1990 &mdash; at the very beginning of the scheme.  The person who is receiving full-time care and attention is not entitled to a carer's allowance in her own right.  Most Deputies realise this, yet a parliamentary question on the matter was put down by Deputy Moynihan who berated me earlier today for not giving the carer's allowance to a person whom he felt was due this allowance.  As I said, the person got the allowance on 8 November last and, as the Deputy is aware, is not due a second allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to that question states that the social welfare officer has twice visited the person concerned since January 1991 in order to establish his entitlement to pension and that investigations are still continuing concerning the proposed transfer of land to his nephews.  When the position has been established his case will be referred for immediate decision and he will be informed of the outcome.  Long delays are usually experienced in that type of case.  We are overcoming these delays by bringing the self-employed and others into the insurance scheme.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to the training courses undertaken by social welfare officers.  They do a four month training course made up of two modules, two months formal training and two months on-the-job training under supervision. Formal training incorporates elements such as courtesy and dealing with the public.  They do refresher courses from time to time.  Even though we are almost out of time I must reply to Deputy Fennell who made reference to a person in Ballymun, from the Fine Gael Party, who wants to run in the local elections.</P>

In the normal way, candidates for elections who are in receipt of unemployment payments have no difficulty in satisfying my Department's deciding officers that they fulfil these conditions.  Accordingly, there is no need for any special steps to be taken in respect of candidates for the local elections.  Therefore, there is no problem.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 24 to 26.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment because of the failure of the Minister to take my ideas on board on Committee Stage.  I spoke very briefly then and outlined the reasons for deleting the section.  Unfortunately, the Minister did not see fit to make the appropriate amendment to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I will explain what this amendment means.  Section 9 (1) (c) of the Bill deals with the question of allowing the institute to deal with matters pertaining to non-ionising radiation as may be specified. The Green Party feel that this matter should not be dealt with by the Department of Energy, it is like asking a person to be a poacher and a gamekeeper at the same time because policy in this area will be set by the Department of Energy. Quite clearly, this matter should be dealt with by the proposed Environmental Protection Agency, a body which, I hope, will be able to extend their tentacles far and wide to investigate all matters which are in any way connected with pollution. This subsection should be deleted from the Bill and I appeal to the Minister &mdash; even at this late stage &mdash; to take my amendment on board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my continuing concern over the transparency in the functioning of the proposed Radiological Protection Institute.  One of the major problems facing the National Energy Board has been the lack of public confidence in their operations and attitudes which has been manifested at the highest political level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I outlined my concerns in regard to the independence of the institute; I said I had a strong suspicion that the employees of the institute, who will be civil servants and subject to the Official Secrets Act, would not have the sort of independent status we would wish to see in an institute charged with <Col N="1704" /> protecting our people from the dangers of nuclear energy.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party maintain that unless freedom of information is an integral part of the institute and enshrined in the Act establishing them they are unlikely to enjoy public confidence.  That would be a pity.  As well as the issue of public confidence it is now generally accepted, for example in the preamble to the EC Directive on Access to Information on the Environment, that public access to information will improve the quality of environmental protection.  Furthermore, there is an inconsistency in the approach to freedom of information adopted in the Bill and that adopted in other legislation such as the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  That Bill at least aspires to address the need for transparency in the operations of the proposed agency or the environmental impact assessment regulations of 1989.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage this point was argued when I stated this Bill was being presented by the wrong Minister.  That is the essential reason we have continued to oppose the contents of this Bill which should have been presented by the Minister for the Environment and not the Minister for Energy.  The reason is that radiological protection is not concerned with price or cheapness of energy or with the strategic considerations that arise when security of energy supply is considered. Radiological protection is about the environment and the health and welfare of people in a sometimes hostile environment.  For that reason the Radiological Protection Institute ultimately must be answerable to the Minister for the Environment and not the Minister for Energy.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to see the institute established as an integral and central part of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The institute will have to monitor, control, advise, educate and occasionally speak out.  They must be free to do all those things unfettered by political control or interference.  Having the institute under the control of the Department of Energy is simply not the way to achieve all these objectives.  The EC <Col N="1705" /> Directive on Freedom of Access to Information on the Environment was adopted on 7 June 1990 and is due to come into force by the end of 1992.  This will require a far greater degree of public access to information than exists at present and the Bill provides a timely opportunity to incorporate these requirements in the establishment of the Radiological Protection Institute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>While we have some reservations about selecting any one aspect of the Bill, we are supportive of this amendment simply because it brings us back to the question of the appropriate Department for looking after the protection of the environment from radiological hazard.  As the Minister knows, and as we debated on Second Stage, Fine Gael's strong view is that it would have been more appropriately and safely placed under the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather the intent is that regulations under this Bill will become the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment in due course.  My only <Col N="1706" /> reservation about supporting the amendment is that it leaves us in a kind of never-never land and we are not sure whether it will be dealt with by the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is an area of great public concern and a number of organisations have expressed serious reservations that the public need to be protected from the hazards of non-ionising radiation in particular.  That has become topical.</P>
    <P>Electro-magnetic fields around high voltage power lines and microwave radiation are causing great concern in residential areas and there is a view that these would more appropriately fall under the Department of the Environment.  This view has been expressed regularly to the Minister and I am surprised, and disappointed, that he has not acted on this. As Earthwatch have pointed out, there is a clear conflict of interest in that the hazardous side effects of activities, such as electricity transmission, are regulated by an institute under the auspices of the Department of Energy.  Therefore, with some reservations, I support this amendment.  I will be interested to hear whether the Minister will be willing to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support this amendment.  We dealt with this issue on Second Stage.  I have dealt at length with the question of why the Minister for the Environment was not involved in the procedures.</P>
      <P>It appears that the Minister for Energy and the Minister for the Environment will be coming together at some point and one will be saying, &ldquo;That is my job&rdquo; and so on.  This may concern a controversial issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister wants to take this to himself in the Bill.  The Department of the Environment have been handling this matter in local areas where it has arisen.  Obviously, it is an environmental issue, and one in which the Department of the Environment in their housing programme have to be involved.  It deals specifically with houses built adjacent to high tension wires.  That is where the major problem arises.  It is an <Col N="1707" /> issue for the Department of the Environment and something with which they will have to deal.  They will be clashing with the Department of Energy as to whether it is safe to build houses in this or that area, what the problem is and so on and I cannot understand why the Minister insists on retaining this provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister has repeatedly emphasised that he intends to have the institute independent; he recognises the importance of its independence and credibility. I hope he does so to the fullest extent because the independence of the institute will be vital.  The institute are going to clash with the Department of Energy, and the Minister for Energy, on the issue of electricity supply and that is where there will be a constant clash. The Electricity Supply Board will, obviously, prove continuously that there is no problem and the institute, if they are to be independent, open, free and making their own decisions, will clash with the ESB.  The latter will go to the Minister who, in turn, will ask the institute whether they have checked this, that and the other and whether they are sure about such and such.  I do not see how the institute will be able to preserve their independence in that sort of clash.  The Bill, unnecessarily, contains a provision that will tie the hands of the institute to a certain extent.  They are going to have to waffle instead of coming out straight with the truth.</P>
    <P>We should be satisfied with regard to the independence of the institute and the freeing of information to the public on all issues.  It is not quite clear that there will be such public access to information under this Bill.  Without that access to information the institute will be more of a hindrance than a help in this area of non-ionising radiation.  The Minister has been very helpful throughout the Committee Stage and seems to be genuinely trying to create an independent institute.  This is an area where they will find it difficult to maintain their independence. I would ask the Minister to look at it again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment raises the whole issue debated at great length on Second Stage, that is, the appropriateness of a gamekeeper and poacher, in that the Minister is the one who would provide ultimately should the ESB decide to go nuclear.  Again in this area of non-ionising radiation in respect of high tension power, it is the Minister who provides for the ESB's activities. There is an inherent weakness in having under the aegis of the Minister for Energy an institute which essentially deals with environmental protection.</P>
      <P>As Deputy MacGiolla pointed out, in this instance there is even greater reason to feel that putting non-ionising radiation under an institute that comes within the ambit of the Minister for Energy is inappropriate in that the sort of issues that arise here will typically be wrapped up with planning Acts and the appropriateness of certain types of development in relation to good planning and environmental protection.  It does not seems very sensible that we should have a Department and an institute under the Department of Energy trying to get involved in what is in essence a planning matter where An Bord Pleanála, the Department of the Environment and the local authorities are the recognised experts in the field.  It does not make sense.  This is an aspect which should be left to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Planning Acts the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála who are the experts in dealing with these issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to oppose the amendment, the intention of which is that the new institute should not have any role in relation to non-ionising radiation.  It is appropriate for the new institute to have a role in this important area.  I do not accept that there would be a conflict of interest here, as suggested by Deputy Garland on Committee Stage and today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new institute is an independent body and Deputies have recognised that I have strengthened the independence of the institute during the course of the <Col N="1709" /> preparation of this Bill.  All the arguments that were made on Second Stage were taken on board by me and amendments were duly made on Committee Stage.  The Bill has been greatly improved and is much different from that I orginally introduced.  The Bill establishes to a much greater extent the independence of the institute that we are about to establish.</P>
    <P>It is not legitimate to argue, the House having accepted amendments strengthening the independence of the institute, against the institute.  I cannot accept the argument casting doubt on the degree of independence that the board would adopt in exercising their responsibility under this Bill.  I would have faith in the new institute.  It will be true to the intention of the House as contained in the Bill.  It will act independently and will give good, independent advice to the public, to the Minister and the Government when they seek it or when the board feel it is necessary to speak out.  That right is clearly enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of this subsection enables the Minister to extend by order the institute's activities to non-ionising radiation such as microwaves, as distinct from microwave ovens, and to radio waves.  There is at present no central authority in Ireland in relation to the assessment of the effects of non-ionising radiation, the laying down of protection measures and the regulation of its occurrence. There is as yet no clear evidence of any adverse effect from this kind of radiation, but the matter is receiving greater attention now.</P>
    <P>There is concern in some circles about the effects of radiation from electricity cables and from MMDS television signals. It is necessary for the new institute to be in a position to take on this new function and acquire the necessary expertise and resources to do so. Recently in my constituency and in other counties in the west concern was expressed about the dangers to the public from radiation emanating from MMDS television equipment.  I had this very thoroughly examined and all the advice <Col N="1710" /> available to me is that there is no danger to the public or any cause for concern.</P>
    <P>The surprising thing is that there is no body in the country to whom the public have recourse in a matter such as this to seek professional independent advice. That is why it is important that there be a section in this Bill enabling the Minister at some time in the future to extend the powers of the institute to include non-ionising radiation.  There should be some professional institute under the aegis of the State whose advice people would rely on and accept, who could give a definitive statement in regard to these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The public should have access to such a body and that is the intention under the terms of this Bill. This is merely an enabling section.  There seems to be a need to act upon this power at some date in the near future and to extend the expertise of the institute to cover non-ionising radiation.  Before any decision to extend the institute's responsibility to non-ionising radiation can be taken, it will be necessary to examine, in consultation with other relevant Government agencies such as the Departments of Communication and Health and other bodies such as the ESB, what needs to be done and which bodies should be assigned the responsibilities.  I intend to have this question examined as soon as possible by my Department in consultation with the relevant agencies.</P>
      <P>The difficulty at the moment is to determine what is necessary and what hazards are to be dealt with.  The scope of non-ionising radiation is vast, the hazards, if any, are not at present clearly identified, nor are the control measures that would be appropriate or useful.  Section 9 (1) (c) is worded so that it can be specific to any one type of radiation considered hazardous and outlines the powers and functions necessary to cope with a specific problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to whether the Department of the Environment or the Department of <Col N="1711" /> Energy is the appropriate Department, that is academic.  If we establish an institute which we are satisfied has the professional expertise and ability to act independently and if we have confidence that the institute will give advice which the public will accept and rely upon, that should be the main objective.  It seems appropriate to have the institute under the Department of Energy.  Given the independence of the institute and the undoubted expertise which exists in the Nuclear Energy Board with regard to radiological protection and nuclear safety matters generally, I firmly believe that the institute is best placed and that it is logical they should assume this role. Radiation is a specialised field which is dealt with worldwide either by separate bodies or by separate entities within wider bodies.</P>
    <P>The new institute on establishment day will inherit a well equipped laboratory and expert staff and will be in a position effectively to carry out their functions as laid out in the Bill.  There is no advantage to be gained in amalgamating the institute with any other body.  What counts is expertise, effectiveness and independence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison referred to the directive on freedom of access to information on the environment.  The EC Directive is currently being examined with a view to its implementation in Irish law.  As I would not wish to pre-empt any legislation which might be brought forward in this area, it would be inappropriate to propose any amendments to this Bill to take account of the EC Directive.  If in the future, following a full examination of the implications of this directive for Irish law, it is considered appropriate to amend the Radiological Protection Act to take account of the directive, I shall bring forward the necessary amendments.</P>
    <P>I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most disappointed that the Minister could not give way on this point.  He quite rightly dealt at some <Col N="1712" /> length with what is covered by non-ionising radiation, which sounds rather technical. He mentioned the potential problems with high volume power lines and also the MMDS system.  I was surprised and disappointed at his statement that he has had MMDS checked out and that his information is that it is completely harmless.  That is not the information we are getting.  There is a real risk of danger to the public from MMDS. It is not generally recognised that the MMDS system is a rip off.  The deflector system which is already in place in most areas is adequate and there is no need for MMDS.  It is ridiculous to play ducks and drakes with public safety when a perfectly adequate and totally safe alternative is there.</P>
      <P>Something else has come to light since Committee Stage.  The organisation most closely involved in this area, Sparks, has produced some research which suggests very serious potential problems with proposed light rail transportation, which may be a viable option in Dublin.  This is very bad news because light rail would seem to provide a lot of answers to transport problems.  Apparently it too is suspect. The importance of independent information and an independent body to deal with the whole area of non-ionising radiation is highlighted following this disclosure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flaherty had some reservations about my amendment.  She was quite right in saying that there could be a gap here.  God knows when the Environmental Protection Agency will be set up.  The legislation has not yet reached the Dáil.  There could be problems if there is a prolonged delay in setting up the agency and if this is an area which requires immediate attention.</P>
      <P>I will put a compromise to the Minister and withdraw my amendment if it is acceptable.  I propose on line 25, after the word &ldquo;radiation&rdquo; to insert the phrase &ldquo;until such time as the Environmental Protection Agency is set up.&rdquo;  If the Minister will not agree to that compromise, I will press my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 30 to 35.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from our discussion of section 9 on Committee Stage and, in effect, means the deletion of all of section 9 (2) (a).</P>
      <P>The discussion on Committee Stage showed that a close reading of this subsection could give rise to some misapprehensions I would prefer to avoid. Section 9 allows for the conferral by the Minister, by order, of additional functions on the institute.  Under subsection (2) (a) the Minister may, from time to time, by order, assign to the institute the following function: the making of arrangements for the supply of such radioactive substances or devices as may be specific in the order for use in the State and, where so agreed by the Minister after agreement with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the conclusion of agreements with appropriate bodies for this purpose.  The provision was taken with a slight amendment from the 1971 Nuclear Energy Act which established the Nuclear Energy Board.  Section 5 (2) (a) of that Act reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The making of arrangements for the supply of fissile fuel or such other radioactive substances or devices as may be specified in the order for use in the State and, where so agreed by the Minister after agreement with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the conclusion of agreements with appropriate bodies for this purpose,</P>
      <P>It is clear that at the time of the 1971 Act the functions envisaged were appropriate to a body such as the Nuclear Energy Board which was set up to oversee a nuclear power industry and advise on proposals for the construction of nuclear power stations.  It is not considered appropriate to the Radiological Protection Institute.  Indeed, a supply role could be at variance with the institute's regulatory functions <i>vis-á-vis</i> users of radioactive substances.  On examination of the files there appears to have been no firm reason for inclusion of this provision in the current Bill.  It would appear to have arisen from a wish merely to retain a role for the institute in relation to supply. However, as this has never arisen, even under the 1971 Act, and there is no reason to suppose that the institute would require such functions in the future, the subsections are, with the agreement of the House, being deleted.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second part of the paragraph concerning the making of agreements with appropriate bodies, the conclusion of such agreements would have been contingent on the supply of the materials.  It was not intended that the institute would be involved in the function of concluding major international agreements which are the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs nor of concluding safeguard agreements as these are relevant to the importer of the radioactive materials. The House will see that I have taken on board the arguments that were made in this case on Committee Stage.  I am bringing forward this amendment to deal with the matter as I said I would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to delete this section.  The fact that he listened to the arguments and concerns that were raised here, which he now admits as being substantial, indicates <Col N="1717" /> that one of the real problems with this Bill is that it was framed from the outlook of a nuclear energy board which would have a very different brief from what I believe should be the brief of a radiological protection agency.  It is encouraging because it improves this Bill substantially.  It also indicates how much easier the job would have been if we had come at it from a very different angle, which Fine Gael believe would have been preferable.</P>
      <P>This amendment removes what could have given rise to very serious concerns and, as the Minister realised when he investigated it, quite justifiable concerns because this proposal was based on an historical situation where there was an expectation of an obligation to supply nuclear resources within this State and could have left a residue of power that would potentially have undermined the intentions of this Bill.  Therefore, I welcome the Minister's amendment and his positive response to points we raised on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I also wish to congratulate the Minister on deleting this section.  It covers a number of points made both on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  I pointed out, on Second Stage, the danger of the institute becoming a nuclear energy board under another name.  This vouches for the Minister's determination.  The fact that he has deleted this section proves that this will not be just another nuclear energy board with all the secrecy and adopted modes from the procedures of nuclear powers over the years.  The deletion of this section makes that distinction.  I want to congratulate the Minister for taking on board the points that were made.  It proves his determination to attempt at least to have an institute totally different from what we have under the Nuclear Energy Board.</P>

      <P>This amendment of ours deals with a substantial element of the Bill we did not deal with adequately on Committee Stage.  It is considered to be absolutely essential on this side of the House that we get this right.  The success of this Bill will depend on how well its provisions protect the public and how much confidence they have in them.  That will be directly related to their perception (1) of the independence of the institute, (2) their accessibility and (3) the accessibility of information the public will need to protect themselves through this institute. In this context it is essential to get right the process by which the institute will report on their work.  On this side of the House we do not believe that the Minister, in his present proposals, has got it right.  Given that he has come such a distance in other areas it would be our hope that he would accept the direction of our amendments even at this stage of the debate.</P>

      <P>If I may revert to my general train of thought, it is crucial that we get this section right.  There is an increasing understanding and awareness <Col N="1721" /> of the need for a maximum level of public information, indeed a right to information, on the part of all citizens in relation to areas of concern to them.  This whole area of radiological hazard is of increasing reality and concern in a rapidly changing world and is likely to continue in that direction in the foreseeable future. Information in this area is vital for the public at large.</P>
      <P>We are concerned that the section, as drafted by the Minister, gives the Minister and his Department too heavy a hand in relation to how the institute will report, the content of those reports, indeed to their independence in taking up issues outside of those immediately required of them by the Minister.  As at present drafted, this is a serious flaw in the Bill. Our amendment seeks that their report on the performance of their functions would go directly to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  To a Minister of good intent this may appear to be an insignificant amendment but, under the section as drafted, the proposal is that their report would go to the Minister and in due course find its way to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is absolutely vital that the independence of this institute be established, that their primary function will be to report to the public through the Houses of the Oireachtas and not to the Minister.  There is an important distinction to be drawn there.</P>
      <P>We are concerned also in relation to section 17 (2) (b) and (c) that their special obligations to report should be specified. These are areas of major public concern on which progress made to date has been most inadequate.  If this institute is to protect people, as we hope it will, the notion that we would have an annual report that would not adequately direct the public mind to progress in these areas would mean that they simply would not be doing their job in the foreseeable future.  Therefore, we consider it important to specify this reportage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of this we are happy also that the amendment to our amendment, those additional specific functions, should be outlined.  It is important that the results of any monitoring of radioactivity, <Col N="1722" /> together with summaries and interpretation of such results, be made available for inspection by the public, with copies made available for public purchase at a reasonable cost.  It is our opinion that this information should be immediately and readily available to the public, through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There should be no question of delays at Departmental level or any undue interference with or limit on the institute in deciding their priorities in performing their functions via the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage it would be my hope that the Minister would accept that there is nothing in these amendments to which he could object.  I am sure they are all functions he would like to see the institute adequately undertake in a transparently, accountable way to the public. I hope he will be able to accept our amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly urge the Minister to support this amendment. Essentially the Minister has moved progressively, throughout this debate, to remove ministerial control and he must be congratulated for recognising a genuine concern among the Opposition parties that we wanted to see an institute that was truly independent and that we would not have a situation &mdash; which unfortunately we had in the past &mdash; where a Minister was seen to intervene, in a way that was not helpful to the public interest, in the affairs of the then Nuclear Energy Board.</P>
      <P>The reason we are not satisfied with section 17, as currently drafted, is that not only does the Minister receive the report under that section, but under subsection (2) he has power to decide the form in which the report is made and the matters reported in it.  I read that as giving the Minister the sort of power a previous Minister for Energy used to exercise to control the then Nuclear Energy Board's ability to offer advice to the public on radiological safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept the bona fides of the Minister and that he would not attempt to muzzle the Radiological Protection Institute but, as an Oireachtas, we have to be mindful of what happened in the <Col N="1724" /> past and seek to put in place legislation that, as far as possible, will not be open to any undesirable influence at any future date.  That is why it is important that we provide in this legislation that the institute will report directly to the House. It was an error on our part to omit something we agreed on Committee Stage, on the suggestion of Deputy Pattison, that this annual report should be presented as near as possible to the end of each financial year and, in any event, not later than six months thereafter.  We would like to see that incorporated in the Bill if the Minister accepts the spirit of our amendment.</P>
    <P>The other point about our amendment is that we are seeking to have the institute report to the Dáil on an annual basis on specific important issues in the field of radiological protection.  These are listed at subsection (2) (a), (b), (c) and (d) of amendment No. 3.  Indeed, the additional amendment on monitoring is one we recognised on Committee Stage should be included.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 34 if accidents occur and have been brought to the attention of the institute &mdash; and the institute has been involved in them &mdash; we should know of them.  If there are issues that could cause public concern and there are lessons to be learned from the fact that things are going wrong, then the Dáil is entitled to be told about them if necessary more often, and the action that has been taken.  That is the essence of section 34, and there are special penalties underlining its importance.  The Dáil would want to see a report on such events.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the preparedness of a national emergency plan and the trials of the procedures involved are also matters the Dáil would like to see addressed in an annual report.  The Chernobyl accident showed up a number of weaknesses in emergency planning.  An annual report on the preparedness and the trials of any procedures that have been carried out by the institute would put an onus on the institute to update their emergency planning, year in year out, and explain to the public, through the Oireachtas, that they <Col N="1725" /> are keeping up to the best modern standards and are in a position to deal effectively with any emergency which, God forbid, should come to pass.</P>
    <P>The issue of disposal of radioactive waste is one which the Minister, in the course of the Second Stage debate, recognised that not everything in the garden is rosy.  The Minister has indicated that he has seen fit to bring in an institute from abroad to advise us on how we might get over this problem.  Given the Minister's concern and his willingness to bring in outside expertise, he must recognise that there is a genuine concern in the House to see an annual progress report on how we are moving on this very important issue.</P>
    <P>What we have set out in our amendment, with the additional amendment put down by Deputy Garland in relation to monitoring, would provide the House with a very good thumbnail sketch each year of our state of preparedness and would give the Oireachtas something to assure the public at large that not only were the institute doing the job but we, the Oireachtas who have charged them with this duty were keeping them to their job by having an annual report from the institute which would keep the pot on the boil and assure the public of the safety they have a right to expect this institute will provide.</P>

If questions arise from these reports we should be able to put parliamentary questions to the Minister on what follow up action he may consider taking on any particular report.

      <P>In supporting the <Col N="1726" /> amendment, I am not worried about subsection (1) as it appears in the Bill as against the replacement subsection as proposed in the amendment.  It does not matter, one way or the other, so long as the report is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is only fair that it should go through the Minister first then be laid before the Oireachtas so that it is not held up.  I presume that is what is in the minds of the proposers.  If a report goes to the Minister first it can remain on the shelves for some time before it is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am really worried about subsection (2) which states:</P>
      <P>Each report under <i>subsection (1)</i> of this section shall include information in such form and regarding such matters as the Minister may direct.</P>
      <P>I suggest that is in conflict with the Minister's statements in the House in regard to the independence of the institute when he ensured that the Minister would not dictate to the institute, that the institute would do their own business, in their own independent way, without interference from the Minister or the Department.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I submit that directing the institute that they shall make information available &ldquo;in such form and regarding such matters as the Minister may direct&rdquo; is an interference with the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister can direct the institute to include information on a certain matter he wants included and to do it in such form as he directs, it will mean that the institute will not be independent and cannot give information in the form in which they want to give it.  Why would the Minister want to direct the institute to give information in a particular form? That may be all right, in the case of statistical information but in some cases he may direct them to give information in a form which does not reveal all the facts.  If the Minister wants the institute to include in their report information on certain matters, they be allowed to do so in such form as they see fit.  The main purpose of the institute is to give information in a clear, open and honest <Col N="1727" /> manner so that there is no cover-up or suppression of information with the use of difficult, scientific language.  It is absolutely essential that the institute give proper information.  I believe the Minister is anxious to ensure that this will be the case.  However, as is often pointed out during debates on Bills, it is not the present Minister we should worry about; we have to take into consideration what the Minister in office in ten years time will do.</P>
    <P>I am worried about how the Minister may use section 17 (2) to give directives to this independent institute on the information they should include in their annual reports.  I see no reason whatever for the inclusion of this subsection in the Bill.  I agree that the Minister should be able to suggest to the institute that they should report on something which has happened during the year.  This amendment refers to information which should always be included in annual reports, for example, the current state of preparedness of the national radiological emergency plan.  As we have found in other Departments, such plans are forgotten about until an emergency occurs, at which time they may be found to be inoperable.  The institute should report on the state of preparedness of the emergency plan each year so that we will know that they have thought about it, tried it out and are satisfied that it works. While I am sure the institute will report on the disposal of waste, which will be an ongoing matter, nevertheless we should provide that they will have to report on this matter.</P>
    <P>Subsection 2 (d) of the amendment provides that the annual report should contain any other information in such form and regarding such matters as the institute sees fit, whereas section 17 (2) provides that it shall include information in such form and regarding such matters as the Minister may direct.  Section 17 (2) will reduce the independence of the institute and will give the Minister power to cloud over any matters in the annual report.  He could direct that the report should be made in a specific form and, <Col N="1728" /> therefore, enable certain facts to be suppressed. The form in which reports are made should be decided on by the institute.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we are discussing amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 3.</P>

      <P>I believe any independent institute would naturally monitor radioactivity and include such information in their annual reports.  In fact, they should not wait for annual reports to give such information.  They should make monthly or three monthly reports on the monitoring of radoactivity, radium, etc., in certain areas.  I am sure that they will make such reports.  The Minister will probably say in his reply that the institute will report on such matters and there is no need to include such a provision in the Bill.  However, reference should be made in the Bill to matters on which they should report.  I support the amendment on that basis.  I particularly support the deletion of section 17 (2) and its replacement by paragraph (d) of the amendment which provides that the annual report shall include information in such form and regarding such matters as the institute sees fit.  Section 17 (2) could be used by a Minister to erode the independence, objectivity, openness and honesty of the Radiological Protection Institute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before the second last line, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) a report summarising the results of any monitoring of radioactivity carried out by or for the Institute,</P>
      <P>(e) details of any subscriptions or gifts received under section 19,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer first to amendment No. 3. Section 17 (1) provides that the Minister shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the <Col N="1729" /> Oireachtas.  That subsection is fine as far as it goes but it does not put any time limit on the submission of such reports. I should like to remind the House that there are considerable delays in regard to reports which are given to Ministers.  The most recent example is the report on Dublin Zoo which was laid before the Minister for Education a year ago but which has not yet seen the light of day. It seems reasonable to include a provision in the Bill which provides that annual reports shall be laid before the Oireachtas within a reasonable time, perhaps six months.  This is a reasonable proposal and I am surprised the Minister has not taken it on board.  Perhaps he will do so.</P>
    <P>Section 17 (2) is very short and merely provides that the annual report shall include information in such form and regarding such matters as the Minister may direct.  We can only hope that the Minister will not ask for information to be included on the items bought with petty cash and on how the staff canteen is run.  I presume the institute will inform the Minister that he should direct them to deal with certain items.  Nevertheless, this provision gives great power to the Minister.  The Minister or any future Minister for Energy &mdash; we do not know who he or she will be, or which party he or she will represent &mdash; might have a different view from the institute on various matters and might direct them to limit the information in their report to certain items.  It appears that the institute will have to accept the Minister's opinion and direction in the matter.  This is a clear breach of the principle of freedom of information, which is what is at issue here, be it in connection with the Radiological Institute or the Environmental Protection Agency.  They should be allowed to give the maximum amount of information.  This is a very important issue.  I would be very supportive of amendment No. 3, which makes reference to three specific areas and includes a fourth very important catch-all provision, as it appears to be a very reasonable amendment and would ensure that the institute would merely put on record the work they had done in specific areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> Unfortunately, no reference is made to two areas in amendment No. 3, but I am glad to note that the movers of that amendment have said that my amendment to their amendment is acceptable to them.  Very briefly, my amendment deals with two further matters which I think should be dealt with in the annual report.  The first part of the amendment would ensure that the annual report includes summarising the results of any monitoring.  I agree with Deputy Mac Giolla who said that if need be we should not have to wait for the annual report.  Indeed, monthly or quarterly reports should be rendered if only to allay the fears of the public as much can happen in a year.  For example, the issue of radon gas is very much in the public eye and we do not know if, or when, there will be another Chernobyl.  Please God, there never will be but something of that nature could happen again.  As we are all aware, there was considerable public disquiet at that time but there was a very poor response from the Nuclear Energy Board.  I hope this will not be repeated by the Radiological Protection Institute.  One would hope that this will happen but I feel such a requirement should be enshrined in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The second part of my amendment refers to subscriptions or gifts received under section 19.  Unfortunately, we did not deal with section 19 on Committee Stage as the debate was guillotined.  I would have opposed that section unless provision was made in section 17 for such gifts or subscriptions received by the institute to be clearly recorded in the annual report.  Clearly, section 19 is a very dangerous section and, if possible, all gifts or subscriptions to the institute should be publicly recorded.  The section has all sorts of ramifications and it is very important that the public have confidence in the impartiality of the institute.  It is very worrying that the institute could receive gifts from vested interests and certainly, unless I receive reassurances from the Minister on these two points and he agrees to incorporate them in the Bill I will press my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members on this side of the House, I acknowledge that the Minister is attempting to ensure the greatest degree of protection in the legislation.  However, we need to consider its implications and see if it contains any loopholes.  There is a long and tragic history of attempts worldwide to cloak in secrecy and conceal the effects of nuclear fall-out and radiation.  Indeed, there is a widespread perception that this has happened. Therefore there is an onus and a responsibility on us, in putting the Bill through the House, to allay such suspicion and belief.  None of us needs to be reminded of Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and many others.  Indeed, there are probably others about which we have heard nothing because of the secrecy and censorship I have spoken about.</P>
      <P>The point was made during the course of the debate on the legislation setting up the Marine Institute that any legislation setting up an institute must guarantee independence and autonomy for that institute in carrying out their work, particularly if it is in a specialised or complicated area.  The people who are best able to decide what should be included in a report are the skilled staff who work within an agency.  Other speakers have made the point, which I accept, that subsection (2), as it now stands, which contains the words &ldquo;information in such form and regarding such matters as the Minister may direct&rdquo; is open to interpretation. A Minister in the future, either wilfully or through ignorance, may decide to direct resources in such a way that the institute will not be able to publish the best possible report.  I hope the institute will also be encouraged to enter into dialogue with international bodies on standards and possible dangers and share information on nuclear power and radiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that pressure could be brought to bear on a Minister or a Government not to release information or minimise dangers for reasons which they would consider to be fair and proper but which from the point of view of the institute would not be the most professional way of doing their work.  Given <Col N="1732" /> this possibility, which perhaps might not occur within the term of office of the Minister, every safeguard must be included in the legislation to guarantee the independence of the institute in reporting not just to the Minister but also to the House.  The amendments which have been tabled are eminently sensible, are not radical and would go a long way towards guaranteeing the protection which the institute and, indeed, the Minister desire.  I would like to think that the Minister would respond positively on that, taking into account the implications not only nationally but internationally. Political pressure has been exercised in the past and could become a type of censorship on the institute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose these amendments because, first, section 17 subsections (1) and (2) are standard provisions in relation to the presentation of the annual reports of semi-State bodies and should therefore remain.  The detailed reports set out in the proposed amendments would all normally be contained in the institute's annual report anyway.  Subscriptions or gifts would of course have to be accounted for as receipts in the annual accounts as provided for under section 16.  I believe it would not be appropriate to insert in the Bill specific details of what should be contained in the report.  This could even prove to be an impediment to ensuring that all relevant and important information from year to year is contained in the report, by isolating in the Bill certain areas of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the proposed section 17 (2) relating to the national radiological emergency plan, this would normally be a function of my Department as co-ordinator of the plan.  With the early publication of the plan, the Deputy will see that trials and the state of preparedness will be features of the information which will be available to the general public.  I would refer Deputies specifically to section 17 (5) of the Bill, where the Minister of the day has power to ask the institute to provide certain information on certain <Col N="1733" /> topics, should the Minister deem it necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty and indeed a number of other Deputies mentioned the necessity for the maximum level of public information.  I would again remind Deputy Flaherty that I have already agreed to amendments in this regard on Committee Stage.  We have already changed the Bill to strengthen this whole question of public information.  The amendment that was made sets out that the institute will provide information to the public on any matter relating to radiological safety which the institute &mdash; not the Minister &mdash; may deem fit.  I would refer Deputies to the section dealing with that, section 7 (1) (k).  That should dispel any fears the Deputies may continue to harbour in regard to the ability of the institute to act on their own in relation to the dissemination of information.  They are not a tool of the Minister, and we have gone out of our way to ensure that they will not be so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton suggested that the Bill would give power to the Minister to muzzle the institute and to decide what the institute could refer to in the report. Other Deputies seemed to travel down that road also.  It is an overly suspicious approach in the first instance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is a wrong interpretation.  Deputies should read the words carefully.  The provision refers to the fact that the Minister can ask the institute to include certain matters.  It does not give the Minister power to prevent the institute from referring to any matter they consider worthy of mention in their report or to any of their activities. Perhaps Deputies would read &mdash; I know many of the Deputies here read it assiduously &mdash; the report of the Nuclear Energy Board.  It is a very extensive document with very comprehensive information. The experience we have had in that regard, even with the existing Nuclear Energy Board, has been satisfactory.  I am just making the point that there seems to <Col N="1734" /> be a misinterpretation of what the section says and the kind of powers it gives the Minister.  Section 17 (2) does not give the Minister of the day absolute control over what should be in the report.  The subsection merely states that the annual report shall include information as the Minister may direct.  The institute can act independently in regard to any other matter they wish to have included in the report.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garland referred to the need to provide in the Bill that the Minister should lay the report before the Oireachtas within a specified period.  Yet the amendments do not refer to this at all. The Bill as proposed by me and as adopted by the House on Committee Stage places an obligation on the institute to report within six months of the end of the financial year, and provides that the Minister would then lay the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is no such provision in any of the amendments and I am surprised the Deputy thought it necessary to refer to it.  The Minister will, as a matter of normal course, publish the reports, bring them before the Cabinet and lay them before the Oireachtas.  The Deputy mentioned one report where the experience seems to have been different but the common experience is that once these reports are presented to the Minister he brings them to an early Cabinet meeting and when they are dealt with there they are laid before the House if that is the requirement under the Act.  I have not heard many complaints that that procedure has not been complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emergency plan and the difficulties experienced at the time of the Chernobyl accident have been referred to.  It might be appropriate for me to make some reference to the emergency plan and the action that has been taken, if the Chair will allow me to indulge in this area for a few minutes.  I want to assure the Deputies that the Government &mdash; not just this Government of which I am now a member but previous Governments &mdash; have been making considerable progress in making adequate preparation for a radiological emergency.  Funding for extra personnel and equipment was provided <Col N="1735" /> to the Nuclear Energy Board immediately following the Chernobyl accident. A new laboratory for the Nuclear Energy Board was completed in 1988 and its equipment is being upgraded continuously. These resources would allow for extensive monitoring in the event of an accident resulting in contamination of the Irish environment.  In addition the Government in 1988 approved an emergency plan for radiological emergencies and allocated £890,000 for its implementation. The plan which is being phased in is designed to provide a rapid and co-ordinated response to any radiological emergency.</P>
    <P>As regards the progress that has been made to date on the implementation of the plan, first an alerting system has been established, including the establishment of an emergency control centre at the Nuclear Energy Board headquarters, which will make recommendations and provide information to the Government and the public.  A national continuous gamma dose rate monitoring system has been installed to detect and monitor any increase in radiation levels here.  A computer system which will speedily process all monitoring information has been commissioned at the Nuclear Energy Board. A Civil Defence organisation has been equipped for and is being trained in the use of portable monitors to undertake local and regional surveys.  Our thanks go to the loyal and dedicated voluntary members of the Civil Defence who have given so much of their valuable free time in that organisation and have made an excellent contribution to community services. I commend everybody involved in the Civil Defence organisation for what they have been doing.</P>
    <P>A whole body monitor has been installed at St. Vincent's Hospital.  Various systems for monitoring air, grass, soil, meat and so on are being installed in the board's laboratory and indeed are being used extensively, as I mentioned on Committee Stage.  Generally speaking it is fair to say that progress to date has been very satisfactory.  Certainly we are far better <Col N="1736" /> prepared now for an emergency than we were at the time of the Chernobyl accident. From what I have said, it is clear that I see no necessity for the amendment or the amendment to the amendment. Therefore I oppose them.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's attitude to the amendments put down by this side of the House to this important section of the Bill.  The Minister said there is great public confidence in the Nuclear Energy Board and a great sense of being adequately protected by them.  However, the Minister is seriously out of touch and I wonder what happened to his party's commitment to giving information to the public, accountabity and reform.  He said this is being done in all Bills and that this is how it will continue.  There is a serious problem because of the general approach the Government are taking in the establishment of the Radiological Protection Institute independent of a general Environmental Protection Agency, under the aegis of the very Department who have responsibility for many of the national agencies or bodies which might produce the greatest risks to the environment at the same time.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann notes with concern the seriously damaging effect on the Irish economy that is likely to flow from the proposals by the EC Commissioner for Agriculture to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and, therefore requests the Government to:</P>
      <P>(a) request the Economic and Social Research Institute to do a comprehensive economic analysis of the total effect of these proposals, over the next ten years, on employment and incomes in Ireland in all sectors of the economy;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> (b) establish an all party committee of Dáil Éireann to simultaneously conduct hearings on these proposals so as to identify the full effects that they will have on Irish economic and social life,</P>
    <P>(c) request the Government, once the studies referred to at (a) and (b) are completed, to arrange for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food to visit all European capitals to explain the full effect that these proposals would have on the Irish economy, and to ensure that these proposals are not adopted in their present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that the Common Agricultural policy is in need of reform but we are determined that such reform will not damage the country's economy.  Ireland's dependence on agriculture is so considerable in comparison with our northern European partners that our special position on agricultural matters will have to be taken into account when final proposals on reform are being framed.</P>
      <P>In recent months we have seen several documents relating to the proposed reform.  The original leaked document from the Commission citing the actual cuts and changes envisaged by the Commission is probably quite close to the eventual package which will be sought by Commissioner MacSharry rather than the document put forward to the Council of Ministers on 4 February last.  The documents have the same background but there is a stark difference in that the leaked document contained specific figures and the document discussed on 4 February was what one might call a &ldquo;reflection&rdquo; paper, full of generalisations but little or no specifics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can assume that the leaked document was the real document, the fact that it was leaked caused considerable <Col N="1738" /> embarrassment and it could not be discussed in its entirety at the subsequent meeting of the Council of Ministers.  We got a very limited, or watered down, version of what we know is being proposed. Commissioner MacSharry said in the last few days that the document &mdash; whether it was the leaked document or the one which was discussed by the Council of Ministers &mdash; was only one of a number of different hypotheses.  We feel it was the real thing and that maybe, in the interim, the Commissioner softened his tone because of the sense of outrage in the agricultural sector here.  There was quite a clear indication of that last week in the European Parliament when Commissioner MacSharry indicated he felt that the budgetary measures would not be sufficient to fund the proposals which he outlined in the original document.</P>
    <P>The proposals listed, if implemented, would devastate Irish agriculture and cause considerable damage to the economy. The best analysis I have seen to date has been drawn up by the Irish Co-operative Society which indicates an annual loss to the economy of about £600 million.  The chairman of Teagasc forecasts a loss to the economy of £1,000 million; he is fairly flaithiúl and debonair in the way he bandies figures about, nevertheless that was the figure he put on the cost to the economy.</P>
    <P>The ICOS estimate that the proposed cuts would force 22,000 farmers off the land and cause knock-on job losses of 16,000 in associated industries.  That is the severity of the proposal, a huge cost to the economy and huge job losses.  As late as today, I saw an article by the previous president of the Irish Farmers' Association, Mr. Tom Clinton, in which he said he believed that the proposal, if implemented, would drive 50,000 dairy farmers &mdash; and farmers in general &mdash; out of the agricultural industry here.  That is a considerably greater figure than the one put forward by the ICOS but there are a varying number of estimates and it is one of the reasons for this motion.</P>
    <P>An independent body, such as the ESRI, should carry out a comprehensive <Col N="1739" /> analysis to confirm or contradict the studies conducted by the ICOS and the farming organisations.  All their figures are extremely high and all indicate severe damage, not just to agriculture, but to the economy.  However, some people have been crying wolf so long and so loudly that we do not expect they will be taken seriously in Brussels.  We suspect that they will not be treated with the respect we would like to see.  Therefore, an independent body like the ESRI should do this job to add credibility to our case.  I am not saying that the farming organisations are leading people astray but they would not have the same resources as a body such as the ESRI to carry out a study. The farming organisations have made a very serious attempt in this regard and we owe them a certain amount of gratitude for carrying out a survey, doing an analysis and giving an estimate.  All the surveys point in a downward direction as far as the economy is concerned and, in particular, where farm incomes and agriculture in general are concerned.</P>
    <P>Such an independent study from the ESRI is necessary to satisfy the general public &mdash; who are fairly sceptical about subjective analysis &mdash; and our fellow members in the Community of the serious consequences the proposed measures would have on our economy.</P>
    <P>The ESRI have an outstanding international reputation, having been commissioned for many reports by the EC. Their ability is well known within the Community.  Quite frequently they do surveys and analyses for the EC and a study done by them would carry great weight in Brussels and in the capitals of Europe.  Other countries would take note if the study were independent.  Additionally, it is imperative that those engaged in the agricultural industry and associated groups to be given an opportunity to put their case to an all-party committee of the Dáil.  It is extremely desirable that those affected should be able to express their views on matters which will affect their lives and livelihoods for many years to come.</P>
    <P>I was Minister for Agriculture for four <Col N="1740" /> years and the only thing I can remember was all the abuse and invective and irresponsible statements which emanated from the then Opposition, the Fianna Fáil Party.  We never had a constructive suggestion.  We never had a constructive contribution from the Fianna Fáil side of the House in those four years.  I notice Deputy Jimmy Leonard is smiling.  He knows it better than anybody else because he was one of the few responsible Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches who had a contribution to make.  He was constructive and he was a gentleman.</P>

      <P>I can only compare the rest to a pack of baying hounds who could not utter a single sentence without being abusive.  This evening we are trying to engender some reason into the discussion because of the terrible possibilities contained in these proposals, leaked or otherwise.  Under the findings of these studies the Government will be in a much stronger position to press for favourable treatment when reforms are being proposed. It will be essential for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food to impress upon their counterparts in the EC the damage across-the-board cuts such as outlined in the leaked document would do to the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>It is my firm conviction that Commissioner MacSharry does not fully understand the implications of his own proposals for Irish farmers and the Irish economy.  The proposals are in line with the demands being made of the EC by the US in the course of the now deadlocked GATT talks.  The industrial nations of the EC and those with a highly geared farm structure, such as Denmark and Holland, can withstand the rigours of the cuts being put forward.  National aid, be it subsidies or direct payments, will be the order of the day if these proposals come into being.  We in this country will not be able to provide that type of national aid; those countries will, so we will be at a tremendous disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1741" /> Our salvation lies with exemptions, or derogations as they are better known, within the Community.  There is no way the economy can suffer an annual loss of £600 million and an overall loss of 38,000 jobs because of the proposals.  The Minister will say they are only proposals but my experience is that proposals have a habit of becoming reality.  I have no doubt that unless we put up a stern fight &mdash; it will be up to us because very few others will do it and at the end of the day we may well be on our own &mdash; those proposals will become reality.  That is why we must start now.</P>
    <P>No farmer, big or small, will be exempt.  I want to knock the lie coming out of Brussels and from Commissioner MacSharry that small farmers will be exempt.  They will not because the keynote of these proposals is price reductions.  They may escape the worst quota reductions for milk but they cannot escape the price reductions.  The proposals are aimed to bring the prices of agricultural commodities in this country down to world prices which are approximately half the prices Irish farmers are getting today.  We are heading towards a beef price of 50p per lb and 50p per gallon of milk.  Those are approximately world prices and it is the Commission's intention to remove all forms of farm support whether internally in the form of intervention or externally in the form of export refunds.</P>
    <P>The tone running through this document is that those supports are to be withdrawn.  We are tending towards world prices which will devastate farming in this country and put maybe 38,000 &mdash; as the ICOS say &mdash; or 50,000 &mdash; as a former President of the IFA said &mdash; people out of work in this part of the island.  We had a 16 per cent drop in farm incomes last year.  The projection for this year is the price package goes through as proposed in Brussels is for a drop of 11 per cent.  That is an accumulated drop in farm incomes over two years of 27 per cent and probably another 27 per cent if the Commissioner's proposals on the reform of the CAP go through.</P>
    <Col N="1742" />
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for allowing me to share his time.</P>
      <P>There is widespread confusion and dis-illusionment in the agriculture industry at present compounded by Commissioner MacSharry and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy. On the one hand Commissioner Mac-Sharry is engaged in a massive public relations exercise seeking to give the impression that his massive CAP cuts will not impact on Irish farmers, while the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, stands idly by without a notion how to cope with this reality.  This only adds to the total confusion in the farming community.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food gives the impression the Government can do nothing domestically at the moment in relation to this matter and that our agricultural policy is totally dependent on what happens in the EC.  I call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food this evening to implement the following measures that would assist farmers incomes.</P>
      <P>First, the entire country should be declared disadvantaged and EC funding sought as part of our compensation for cuts in the CAP and as a result of the GATT negotiations.  It is disgraceful that the Government have taken four years to finalise our national submission under the present review of this scheme with officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food flying over to Brussels and back to correct mistakes in order to meet EC regulations.  That is the impression the farming community are getting about this matter.  This is disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has considered an appeals body in respect of representations of various agricultural bodies and land commissioners on the appeal system with no reference to the United Farmers Association or Macra na Feirme, agricultural organisations.  Surely this adds insult to injury to a farming community who are seeking an explanation about leaked versions of proposals in relation to disadvantaged areas that have been submitted to Brussels.  The appeals mechanism was an opportunity for the Minister <Col N="1743" /> to do the necessary explaining why certain townlands are included and others are not.</P>
    <P>Second, farmers need finance for working capital at the lowest possible interest rate.  This could be achieved by borrowing money from Europe at 10 per cent if the Government have the will to underwrite the exchange rate risk, as was done in 1984 when the then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government made money available at 5 per cent for working capital.  This, in some measure, was responsible for the turnaround in depressed farm incomes at the time.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is imperative that a special case be made on behalf of Ireland by the Taoiseach at the highest European level to convince our European colleagues that agriculture is a major industry in this country in terms of jobs and exports.  It is time the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food showed they have a special relationship since our so-called Presidency of Europe rather than mere public relations.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the House I wish to share some of my time with Deputy Clohessy.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes and supports the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to have the forthcoming negotiations on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy progressed in a way that best promotes the interests of Irish farmers and the longer-term development of our agricultural economy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this debate.  It is very timely, even though the terms of Deputy Deasy's motion are not appropriate.  There are, in fact, no formal proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and, therefore, formally calling for studies of their impact is, to say the least, premature. When proposals come on the table <Col N="1744" /> they will, of course, be quantified as all important proposals are.  The Irish approach to the negotiations will be informed among other things by the result of that quantification.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate, however, because it gives us an opportunity to tease out the direction in which we would wish to see reform of the CAP go, and make no mistake about it, there will be proposals for substantial changes in the Community's agricultural policy in the near future.  Inevitably, these proposals will result in real change.  Even if the GATT negotiations never existed, pressure from a variety of factors make change a certainty. The question for us is not, therefore, whether there should be change but rather what aims we wish to see furthered in that change and how these aims should be attained.</P>
    <P>Before going on to detail the Government's approach to CAP reorientation, I would like to comment briefly on the background to the public discussion which is currently under way in relation to this matter.  In sketching the essential background I would hope to dispel some of the confusion which has, unfortunately, attended this issue and which has, in turn, given rise to some misplaced comment.</P>
    <P>Last January a paper was leaked from within the EC Commission which contained ideas and suggestion for a radical re-orientation of CAP support.  The Minister, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, understandably refrained from commenting officially on this unauthorised &ldquo;leak&rdquo; and indeed the agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, has since been publicly quoted as saying that neither he nor his Commission colleagues are irrevocably committed to the specific ideas which the leaked document contained. As such, that document has no particular status and it may yet be the case that when they are eventually presented, the Commission's formal reform proposals will differ significantly from the ideas outlined in the January paper.  That is why formally calling for its quantification is inappropriate, although I should inform the House that the <Col N="1745" /> Department have, of course, looked at its implications in some detail and furthermore the ESRI are, in any event, doing some work on its economic impact.</P>
    <P>It is not, however, the precise detail of the document which should concern us &mdash; this, as I have said, could eventually be significantly changed &mdash; rather, it is the thinking behind the document and the way in which it envisages agricultural support moving in the future on which we should be focusing.  This was set out in a formal paper submitted by the Commission to the Council of Ministers at its meeting in early February.  This reflections paper envisages the most radical overhauls of the mechanisms of the CAP since the inception of the policy.  It has been tabled by the Commission against the background of a deep, current crisis in Community agriculture the major manifestations of which are that budgetary costs are escalating rapidly, up 20 per cent compared with 1990; major market sectors, notably beef, milk and cereals, are displaying chronic imbalance and intervention stocks are mounting inexorably; and producers' incomes throughout the Community are failing to reflect increasing budgetary spending on agriculture.</P>
    <P>In the light of this scenario, the Commission argues that the fundamental objectives of its suggested reform are to reorientate policy socially and economically so as to ensure that sufficient numbers of farmers are kept on the land, that the natural environment is preserved and that rural development is further stimulated.</P>
    <P>In its document, the Commission suggests controlling surplus production and attaining market balance using such traditional instruments as price policy and quantitative controls but also proposes support for extensive production and measures which are specifically environment oriented.  In addition, there would be a redistribution of support and compensatory measures &mdash; including direct income aids &mdash; which would, it is suggested, cushion small and medium sized producers from the adverse effects <Col N="1746" /> of reduced price and intervention support. Regional aspects, in particular the requirements of the less favoured areas, would also be addressed in the course of the overall reform exercise.</P>
    <P>More specifically, cereals prices would be reduced to make them more competitive with imported substitutes and compensation on the basis of an aid per hectare would be paid to all producers with full compensation for smaller producers and partial compensation for others.  In the Commission's view, the reduction in cereals prices would, in turn, allow for a downward adjustment of prices in the livestock sector, with livestock farmers being compensated through increased premiums.</P>
    <P>The Commission's thinking would also assign farmers a greater role in protecting the rural environment and preserving the countryside and, accordingly, farmers would be encouraged to use environmentally friendly methods and to participate more actively in long term set aside schemes involving the promotion of afforestation.</P>
    <P>In the course of the preliminary Council debate which followed the presentation of the Commission's reflections, there emerged a general consensus that fundamental CAP reform is now unavoidable.  There was, however, a wide divergence of views as regards the precise form which the necessary reforms might take.  On the basis of the Council's initial exchange, however, Commissioner Mac-Sharry has undertaken to formulate detailed reform proposals and to present these formally to a future Council.  As of now, it is expected that these proposals will be tabled by June but needless to say, the Minister has already given a clear indication of Ireland's likely priorities in the forthcoming discussions.</P>
    <P>We start from the position that the primary objectives of the CAP, as laid down in Article 39 of the Rome Treaty, are as valid today as when they were originally adopted.  These cannot be called into question.  Furthermore, the policy must give effect to these principles in an effective way.  For Ireland, therefore &mdash; and the Minister has already <Col N="1747" /> stated this in the Council &mdash; it is essential that whatever concrete proposals are eventually tabled will not be such as would undermine the effectiveness of the CAP.  The Commission has, in fact, acknowledged that, whatever the nature of the proposed reforms, the CAP must continue to be based on its fundamental principles: a single market, Community preference and financial solidarity.  But we must ensure that the policy solidly respects these principles in practice and not just in theory.</P>
    <P>Time and again the Government have stated unequivocally their commitment to ensuring the continued viability of our agriculture and food industry, to maintenance of the fundamental principles of the CAP and to seeing that Irish vital national interests are safeguarded.  Most recently, these commitments, together with a firm undertaking to maintain the maximum number of fullime, commercially viable family farm units, have been reiterated in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and I can promise the House that these commitments will inform our attitude towards the coming negotiations.</P>
    <P>We accept, of course, that adjustments are inevitable, partly for the reasons already outlined and partly &mdash; although this is not necessarily being tied into the process at this stage &mdash; for GATT reasons.  The Minister, however, has strongly underlined that change must not only respect the considerations I have already outlined but also be proportionate to the problems we face.  A root and branch reform which goes beyond what is required at this time is unnecessary, untimely and undesirable and will not be supported.</P>
    <P>What we must face up to is the fact that the policy will have to be more open to the market in the future and less dependent on Community support mechanisms. As well as being necessary, it is desirable.  A long term future cannot be built on intervention and subsidy dependency. Such a policy development must mean some adjustment of support prices and some tighter supply control.  What is <Col N="1748" /> important is that this takes place gradually and in a balanced way.</P>
    <P>It is also important &mdash; and here we have no quarrel with the Commission's aim &mdash; that, if adjustment means some sacrifices for producers, smaller scale and other vulnerable producers are reasonably protected.  Where we may have difficulty is in how this is to be done. Certainly, proposals which, while to some degree helping vulnerable producers, would undermine the more commercial element of our agriculture could not be justified.  Here again it is a question of the degree and the speed of change which is at issue as well as finding a range of instruments &mdash; not all of which involve market supports &mdash; to protect smaller scale producers.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, changes in support arrangements cannot be allowed undermine the competitiveness of grass based livestock production which is central to the Irish agricultural economy.  The general thrust of the Commission's approach would, unfortunately, do this.  Very much lower cereals prices will reduce the costs of livestock production but not for those who produce mostly from grass.  Yet under the Commission approach cereal producers would, to varying degrees, receive direct compensation and producers of livestock from non-grass feed indirect compensation, while our more extensive grass based production would simply have its competitive position undermined.  This cannot be justified on economic or social grounds.  It is not, of course, impossible to find solutions to our problems in this regard and all our energies will be devoted in the negotiations to emphasising to our partners the critical nature of this question for us.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling at this stage that, while the Commission's approach is not directly being related to the GATT negotiations, these are a major factor in the background.  Any policy adjustments made within the Community will inevitably count towards whatever we are eventually required to do if there is a GATT agreement.  When the Community's GATT offer was agreed last November, the Council accepted that in <Col N="1749" /> its implementation account would be taken of the particularly difficult situation of certain categories of producers and regions.  At the same time the Commission indicated that it would bring forward proposals for complementary measures, involving Community financial solidarity, aimed at offering a viable future to Community farmers through ensuring the competitiveness of European agriculture, guaranteeing appropriate levels of income support and reinforcing structural assistance.  The Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, has underlined the importance he attaches to these commitments in the context both of the GATT outcome and CAP reform process. Ireland will press consistently to ensure that these are fully honoured in the eventual decisions.</P>
    <P>Before we move to the longer term Commission proposals we have, of course, to deal with the price proposals for the coming marketing year.  These were formally tabled at the beginning of this month and will be subject to resumed discussions in the Council of Ministers at the beginning of next week.  In the light of the budgetary difficulties to which I have already referred and given the Commission's overriding concern to ensure that the agricultural guideline &mdash; the limit on FEOGA spending which was decided by the European Council in 1988 &mdash; is respected in the current year, it is not surprising perhaps that the 1991-92 price proposals are extremely restrictive and set in a short term time frame.  Predictably, price cuts of varying degrees of severity are proposed for most products; a 2 per cent reduction in milk quotas and the elimination of &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; intervention for beef are also envisaged.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that these proposals cause us all extreme concern.  It is abundantly clear that livestock products would be severely affected and this obviously is a specific aspect which we shall seek to redress during the forthcoming negotiations. The sheepmeat, cereals and sugar sectors would also have to bear cutbacks, as would sectors of lesser importance here.  This House needs no reminding that 1990 was an extremely difficult <Col N="1750" /> year for Irish agriculture and that farm income registered a serious decline for the first time since 1986.  The international trading environment remains unfavourable and the high level of intervention stocks for the major EC commodities will continue to put pressure on markets for some considerable time. Developments in the Gulf have undoubtedly had profound political and economic consequences, while events in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe add to the general uncertainty and complexity of the situation.  In these circumstances and having regard to the likely implications for Irish producers both of the GATT negotiations and the longer term CAP reorientation, it is, in our view, totally inappropriate that the Commission should at this point be proposing such far reaching adjustments to the various market mechanisms.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that the Commission are now under considerable budgetary pressure or that intervention stocks, particularly for beef and cereals, have again reached unsustainable levels.  We would argue, however, that the Commission are still not justified in drawing structural conclusions on the basis of factors which I believe will, in many cases, prove comparatively short lived. It is also a fact that the Community's budgetary control has improved in recent years, the present threat to the guideline notwithstanding.  Also, we have argued strongly that some exceptional allowance must be made for the budgetary and market consequences of German unification.</P>
    <P>Ireland's approach to the forthcoming price negotiations will be a constructive one.  This, however, does not imply that we are willing to compromise the future livelihoods of Irish producers or that we are ready to contemplate support withdrawal to such an extent that the viability of Irish agriculture and the rural lifestyle which it sustains would be undermined. Accordingly, the Minister is determined to seek substantive adjustment to the Commission's proposals as presented and to do his utmost to ensure that the various commitments which the Government <Col N="1751" /> have given in relation to agriculture are delivered upon.  We are pressing for a much less restrictive package.  I said earlier, nobody is opposing the idea that the policy needs adjustment.  This is of fundamental importance and requires detailed proposals from the Commission which we do not yet have.  When they are available, all the institutions of the Community will need to reflect on their implications for agriculture and economies generally, with this reflection being followed by a patient negotiating process.</P>
    <P>None of us can claim to have all the answers to all the problems facing us.  We have, however, clear ideas on the type of agri-food industry and the type of rural economies we wish to see.  The task before us is to adjust our support system in a way that facilitates rather than prevents the establishment of what we wish to see in place.  Negotiations on this will be difficult and complex.  They are not helped by some of the proposals which the Commission has tabled in this package. We will be arguing that the best approach for the coming year is to reach decisions largely confined to what is technically necessary and to bring forward the longer term proposals at the earliest possible date.  Our energies should be spent dealing with those rather than on essentially short term proposals.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to the longer term issues before concluding.  It is important to put these in context and also to avoid losing heart and creating a feeling that we have lost the war before the first battle begins.</P>
    <P>We are faced with a GATT negotiation which will be difficult but in which the Community has not lost sight of its interests or of where it is prepared to go.  We have a definite Community offer which, if accepted, would ensure that the fundamentals of the CAP are preserved, even if there is some reduction in overall support levels.  We will be insisting that the Community stick to its guns on this. We have obtained commitments on how we would implement GATT obligations and on the safeguards and complementary measures which would be put <Col N="1752" /> in place.  The Minister will be insisting on these commitments being honoured.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that the Commission's approach to the reform off the CAP has to be seen and where we disagree with that approach it is to the extent that it conflicts with those commitments. But it is important to remind ourselves that on many of the Commission's aims we are in agreement and that there are important elements in their approach we can support or at least accept.  The most important of these are the underlining of the importance of preserving the fundamental principles of the CAP; the need to maintain competitive Community agriculture; the need to create a balance between price policy and supply control and, in that context, the increased emphasis on set-a-side in the case of cereals and related crops; the importance being given to environmental issues and the necessity to support more extensive farming systems; some switch in emphasis from intervention support to direct livestock payments, and the emphasis being placed on the protection of smaller scale and other vulnerable producers. We can build on these elements in a way that will ensure that reform will lead to a tighter, more effective and more viable policy in the future.</P>
    <P>But we can only do that if we can get the Commission and our partners to accept that some elements in the approach go directly contrary to a number of the aims which I have already listed.  In particular, the way in which support would be adjusted between different levels of farm production and, if the leaks turn out to be correct, the way in which intensity of production would be measured could undermine the competitiveness of much of Community agriculture. In our case the degree to which the balance would swing against grass based production, without appropriate compensation built into the relevant market organisations, would be a particular and critically overriding factor.</P>
    <P>Our first task in the negotiations is to try to ensure that these central elements are changed and I believe we can rely on the support of all of Irish society in this. <Col N="1753" /> Our second task is to get a clear acceptance that, if there has to be a tightening of policy &mdash; and everybody accepts that there has &mdash; then economies such as Ireland's with their heavy dependence on agriculture, are the most vulnerable and will suffer the most in social and economic terms from the adjustment.  If the commitments regarding taking account of the needs of the regions most affected are to be honoured &mdash; and it is a prime Government aim that they should &mdash; then elements in the proposals which hit hardest at those regions must be changed and adequate Community financial resources must be provided to fund suitable compensatory measures to meet their adjustment needs.</P>
    <P>These resources would be primarily, but not exclusively, in the agricultural area and their provision is likely to require adjustments to existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that, as the budgetary problem which is one of the factors which dictated the form of the current price proposals is, in part, due to the costs of German unification, those costs should be met outside the guideline for agricultural expenditure.  This is clearly logical and in line with earlier commitments.  Obviously, the Minister is concerned that such a solution would continue into future years.  But the question of resources goes further than that. If there is to be a partial but significant adjustment in the way in which CAP support is provided then the policy &mdash; including compensatory measures &mdash; will require additional funding for the foreseeable future.  This will require new decisions in regard to the agricultural guidelines or the provision of new funding in some other way.  Ireland will insist that adequate Community resources are provided to meet the needs of the policy as it emerges from the reorientation negotiations.</P>
    <P>In all of this we are not alone.  Many member states share our views both on the way in which policy should be adjusted and the need to provide for adequate compensatory arrangements. While we have always known this, in <Col N="1754" /> order to copperfasten that support the Minister and his officials have been engaged in a series of meetings with the Commission and our partners in recent months in particular.  That process is continuing and will intensify in the weeks and months ahead.  The Government as a whole, in the GATT context and in the context of agricultural policy adjustment, have made their position abundantly clear.  For all of these reasons there is no need for this House to adopt motions such as the one suggested.  We do not need to call for a special analysis of the effects of the Commission's suggested approach or for a Dáil committee to look at its implications.  Full analysis is not possible until the detailed proposals are made and, to the extent that some analysis is possible at this stage, it is already being done.  I have clearly indicated that the implications of the approach are well understood both for the agriculture sector and for the economy as a whole. The Minister, and the Government, are using all appropriate means in bilateral discussions and at Council to put across the Irish view of what needs to be done and of the consequences for the whole Irish economy if the eventual decisions to not take adequate account of that view.</P>
    <P>We are confident that at the end of the day the decisions taken will be the right ones.  We believe that our view of what needs to be done is sensible and that we can rely on the understanding of our partners and on Community solidarity to ensure that the balance of policy adjustments will not significantly disadvantage any region, particularly any of the Community's more vulnerable regions.  What we need now is to stick to our view in the negotiations and to have the full support of all sections of Irish society for that position.  The House can give voice to that support tonight by supporting my amendment which I now commend to all Deputies.  I will give the remainder of my time to Deputy Clohessy.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for allowing me some time to make my points.  The Progressive Democrats believe that the proposals to reform the CAP advanced by Commissioner MacSharry, along with the GATT negotiations and, indeed, this year's EC farm price package, add up to a very serious threat to the viability of Irish agriculture, the family farm and, indeed, the entire national economy. This is a crisis not only for those engaged directly in agriculture but it reaches far beyond the farm gate because of the importance of this industry to our economy.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is three times as important to Ireland as to the average member of the European Community and is the source of one-fifth of the jobs here.  The Progressive Democrats accept that there must be reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and that the steady rise in intervention stocks cannot go on indefinitely. However, the price of reform is crucial and that is what is most alarming about the present proposals by Commissioner MacSharry.  While I know he has yet to bring forward more detailed measures, the worrying factor is that the preliminary document he has tabled will cost the country between £300 million and £400 million.  That would be a national catastrophe and not just a catastrophe for the agricultural sector alone. Another worrying feature of the preliminary proposals by Commissioner MacSharry is that they could set one group of farmers against another in Ireland and would decimate much of our commercial farming sector.  Such a policy is totally unacceptable.  By international standards Ireland has relatively few big farmers.  We must remember also that our commercial farming sector is the backbone of our food processing industry which is the key to ensuring that we can build internationally competitive food companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that whatever the final outcome of the GATT negotiations and the reform of the CAP, Ireland's vital national interest as far as agriculture is concerned is protected.  I <Col N="1756" /> am satisfied that this is a priority of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>My party recently published a detailed policy document on reform of the CAP. In it we called for the establishment of a national policy forum to agree a national consensus on how the CAP should be reformed from the Irish point of view. We would favour such a national forum in which all farm organisations, together with other interested bodies, such as the IDA, the CII, the trade union movement and the various agri-business sectors, would have the opportunity to have their say over a two or three day session. Because of the huge national importance of the agricultural sector, which reaches far beyond the farm gate, I do not envisage such a forum being divisive or confrontational. Parties on all sides of the House along with representatives of industrial and commercial interests share a common interest in seeking to ensure that the overall benefits of the CAP are retained for this country in one form or another.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that over time there must be a greater equalisation between farm prices within the Community and world market levels, but this cannot be achieved overnight and not in a fashion that would simply devastate Irish agriculture. Our primary concern must be to ensure a decent livelihood on the land for the maximum number of farm families. We must also ensure that agricultural production continues to provide the raw materials for an internationally viable and commercial food processing sector here.  We have great natural advantages in food processing, such as the relative non pollution of our countryside and our reputation as a green unspoiled location. We cannot allow any reform of Community agricultural policy to destroy these natural advantages and in the process destroy also thousands of jobs so badly needed in our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will be supporting the motion in the name of the Fine Gael Party.  It is a reasonable request that the Government should allow an independent body like the ERSI to examine the proposals from Brussels and, indeed, to examine the Government's response, if there has been a response.  We think it is a reasonable request being made by the Government that they should allow an independent body like the Economic and Social Research Institute to look at the proposals coming from Brussels and the Government's response to them if there has been one at all.</P>
      <P>Having heard the Minister's speech tonight we should be concerned that there seems to be no leadership in the Department of Agriculture at the moment.  There is a need for an outside body to look at the proposals that are coming forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be useful, too, to set up an all party committee.  Certainly my party's approach to agriculture would be different from the approach of the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Parties and certainly <Col N="1759" /> from that of the Progressive Democrats. Our approach to the CAP has certainly been stated by my predecessor in this spokesmanship, Deputy Emmet Stagg, on a number of occasions.  We would welcome an all Party committee of this House looking at the situation.</P>
    <P>We would have thought that the Taoiseach and the Minister would have been heard much more loudly than they have been in warning of the dangers to our basic industry.  Perhaps it would be useful if the Minister and the Taoiseach went around the capitals but I would far prefer to see a much more urgent approach to the statements, to the documents, to the leaks, whatever one calls them that have been emanating from Brussels in recent times.</P>
    <P>Back in 1987 a document was issued in very attractive form by the Commission. It was called &ldquo;The Community: a Brief for European Taxpayers&rdquo;.  It was quite clear then what the approach of the Community's budget was to be.  Certainly at that time we heard no real response to that document.  The version that was given out in Dublin stated that the agriculture share would have to be reduced gradually and funds shifted to policies linked to the third industrial revolution developed within the internal market and to structural operation designed to promote greater cohesion.  What that meant in reality was represented in a little graph on this document which showed clearly that between 1987 and 1992 the amount of funds available to agriculture would reduce from 60 per cent &mdash; not quite accurate at 60 per cent &mdash; in 1987 to 50 per cent in 1992.  That money would be taken from the agriculture funds and nine per cent of that ten per cent reduction would go to the Structural Funds.  The other one per cent would go to research or some other area.  In any event the agriculture moneys were to be reduced and the moneys transferred to increase the other funds available so that when we did get notice of increases in Structural Funds it was not made clear by the Government at the time to the Irish farmers that those funds were <Col N="1760" /> coming from their money, that it was not new money or additional money.  It was coming directly from agriculture and it was simply a transfer from agriculture to another area.</P>
    <P>That is where this Government first blundered in not digging their heels in at the Commission in Brussels or at the Council of Ministers or at European Parliament level.  They did not say that they did not like the direction being taken by the European Commission.  They did not object.  They allowed that proposal to go through and that policy to be the policy of the European Community.  Now we have to accept that certain decisions will be made in agriculture that will be most unwelcome to this country.  The Minister for Agriculture himself is not in the country.  He is probably away on business related to this area.  However, if he could have been here, he should have been here, because this is a very important document.  The Minister has said that he is sticking by the objectives of the Treaty of Rome in Articles 39 and 40.  I wonder if he has read them lately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He is probably briefing himself on the agricultural petroleum position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective in Article 39 (a) was to increase agricultural productivity, not production, by promoting technical progress and by ensuring rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in particular, labour.  I would certainly agree that he should have used the labour factor, but from 1972 until 1988 the number of people working in agriculture dropped from almost 0.25 million to 166,000, a drop of around 80,000 people.  So the first objective &mdash; and that was under various Governments &mdash; was not adhered to because of a flight from the land which was unequalled for many years up to then.  The second objective was to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture.  Again this is <Col N="1761" /> one of the objectives that certainly has not been lived up to for many years since we joined the Community.</P>
      <P>There was a time in the early seventies when indeed great benefits accrued to some farmers but overall since then the amount of benefit that has accrued to the farming community has been very uneven indeed.  This is one of the areas that we, as a party, would like to see being looked at very closely in the investigation to see how the funds transferred under the agricultural heading affected the various sectors.  Has it all gone to big farmers?  Has it all gone to the people in the factories and the intervention premises? How much has really got through to the farming community?  It is well worth while having that proposition looked at by all sides and investigated by a body like the Economic and Social Research Institute.  That is why we would like to see this motion being carried, and with, perhaps, the help of our colleagues in the Progressive Democrats, it may be carried when we all finish up here tonight.</P>
      <P>The third item in the objectives of Article 39 was to assure the availability of supplies to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.  Again one would have to question whether that objective has been adhered to.  Certainly with the demands from the Americans in the GATT negotiations one would have to question whether we can stand up for that objective in our negotiations.</P>
      <P>In Article 40 we are told that in order to attain the objectives of Article 39 a common organisation of markets shall be established.  The three legs of that particular school were the single market, the Community preference and financial solidarity.  I am glad to hear the Minister at least say that he still has those objectives in mind.  I have to say his performance and his recent lack of intitiative or aggression in defending these articles is very obvious indeed.  It was stated in the first paragraph of the famous document that was leaked on 6 December, 1990 that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy <Col N="1762" /> was created at a time when there was a dearth of most products in Europe.</P>
    <P>The document that followed, though not as complete, on 4 February 1991 said:</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy was created at a time when Europe was in deficit for most food products.</P>
    <P>We can see that the documents came directly from the same stable with a few changes in the wording.</P>
    <P>The methods used to float ideas are not new to the Commission or to Governments here in order to ascertain what may be the reaction to any of their proposals. We have seen such an example in Britain this week when the poll tax proposals were leaked a week before being introduced in the House of Commons. It is an old &mdash; though I will not say respected &mdash; method of putting across ministerial or departmental proposals so that if they do not appear to go down politically too well they are able to backtrack on them.  Certainly these proposals are not being back-tracked.  If we take what has already been agreed in the budgetary sense, then it is obvious that these proposals will be fought vigorously.</P>
    <P>We have already seen the Minister and the farming leaders at odds.  We have seen parades outside these gates today. We have witnessed members of the European Parliament of the Fianna Fáil Party seemingly on the side of the Commissioner for Agriculture, if we listen to Mr. Lane.  Yet if we listen to Mark Killilea, MEP, we would not be sure whose side he is on.  At one stage he appeared to be talking on behalf of the farming community, though divorcing himself from two farming organisations, and, on another, appeared to be talking for the Government.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems encountered by the Fianna Fáil Party in recent years is that their membership of the European Community has been aligned with a group that has absolutely no influence in Europe, no say whatsoever. Rather than follow the example of the British Conservative Party in one aspect <Col N="1763" /> at least &mdash; who find themselves aligned with a group that also has no influence or power in the European Parliament &mdash; they might endeavour to join one of the larger groups where they would have a say, that is, within those groups that influence policy in the EC whether it be the Socialist or Christian Democratic groups&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position advanced here this evening has been underlined by various farming organisations.  If we look at the document produced by the Irish Farmers' Association we see there is need to be concerned, particularly when we listen to what Mr. Tom Clinton, former president of the IFA had to say, when he suggested that anything up to 50,000 people would lose their jobs should the proposals emanating from Brussels be implemented.  What we heard from the Minister here this evening would lead me to be very worried that the Government have any policy on the present attack on the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I raised the matter of the cutbacks in the price mechanism approximatedly a month ago &mdash; a week before they came through &mdash; the Minister said he would not deal with any leaks.  When <Col N="1764" /> the document was leaked from Brussels a week before Christmas he said then also that he would not deal with leaks. Yet both sets of information have been totally confirmed &mdash; the cuts proposed in the various commodities when the price mechanisms are being considered are exactly those leaked from Brussels a month ago.  We are told what will be their effect on the agricultural community by the Irish Farmers' Association.  We are told that the cut in grain prices will be of the order of 42 per cent leading to pig-meat and poultry meat prices falling by 20 per cent, when beef and lamb prices would then be totally undermined. Futhermore, it is contended that our grass based milk production would be penalised if there is a cheap grain policy agreed in aid of Dutch and Danish farmers.  It is stated that major cuts in farm prices overall would mean a cut to our economy of approximately £400 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he cannot take those types of figures on board, at the same time rejecting an idea that any independent body should be allowed investigate them.  He also rejects the idea that anybody, other than the Minister or the Government, be allowed put their views forward to a committee of this House or to an independent body investigating these issues.  Furthermore, the Minister refuses to acknowledge a third body in agriculture, the newer smaller one, namely the United Farmers' Association who deal specifically with small producers. For example, he will not even give them representation on the board dealing with appeals <i>vis-á-vis</i> disadvantaged areas.  It is my view that the Minister is locking himself into an ivory tower which will result in total disaster for our agriculture industry.  He appears to assume he has all the answers whereas he certainly has not.  His performance to date in his Department would not lead one to be confident of his handling of the GATT negotiations or in dealing with his old friend, Commissioner MacSharry, in Brussels.</P>
    <P>This House should support the motion in the name of Deputy Deasy which <Col N="1765" /> affords us all an opportunity to air our concerns not only about the present position but also on the part of all of those people to whom the Common Agricultural Policy has not been of any great benefit.  Indeed, it has had a negative effect on smaller people within the industry who have witnessed 80 per cent of its benefits go to 20 per cent of the farming community.</P>
    <P>There is need for a revision of our overall agriculture industry.  Such open discussion should be initiated by the Minister either in this House or by way of the various farming organisations.  He should be prepared to take on board what is being said.  Nothing I have heard in the course of the Minister's remarks here this evening or in what has been said in this House in recent weeks would lead me to be in any way confident.  Were I a farmer I would be most concerned at the Minister's approach in recent months and weeks and at what will be his performance in ensuing weeks and months <i>vis-á-vis</i> this most important industry.</P>

      <P>There is a crisis in Irish farming.  The operation of the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; known as CAP &mdash; has played a large part in causing that crisis.  Present concern should be not to exaggerate the proposal of the EC Commissioner for Agriculture but rather to decide an effective national farming strategy. Rather than fighting an unwinnable battle to preserve the CAP, or some version of it, the Government and farming organisations should be demanding that any reduction in EC farm supports be matched by a compensatory increase in EC Structural Funds for Ireland.  In referring to farming organisations I include the UFA who, with 70,000 members, are entitled to be represented but who have been denied a place on the tribunal set up to hear appeals under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I call for their representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might give an example of what the <Col N="1766" /> Common Agricultural Policy is all about. I got the best assessment possible from the report of the Commission of the European Community, and that was the communication of the Commission to the Council dated 1 February 1991.  It gives a fair indication of what had been happening under the Common Agricultural Policy, known as Price Support, which depends almost exclusively on income supports and price guarantees and is largely proportionate to the volume of production and, therefore, concentrates the greater part of support on the largest and most intensive farms.  For example, 6 per cent of cereal farms account for 50 per cent of the surplus area in cereals and for 60 per cent of production; 15 per cent of dairy farms produce 50 per cent of milk in the Community and 10 per cent of beef farms have 50 per cent of beef cattle.  The effect of this is, as has been pointed out by the previous speaker, that 80 per cent of the support provided by FEOGA is devoted to 20 per cent of farms which accounts also for the greater part of the land used in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The existing system does not take adequate account of the incomes of the vast majority of the small and medium size farmers.  The <i>per capita</i> purchasing power of those engaged in agriculture has improved very little over the period 1975 to 1989.  This development is all the more worrying in that over the same period the Community's active agricultural population has fallen by 35 per cent.  The situation is particularly difficult to accept in the context of the ever-increasing expenditure.  Please note that in 1975 the EAGGF guarantee budget was 4.5 billion ecu.  This had risen to 11.3 billion ecu in 1980 and to 31.5 billion ecu in 1991, i.e. 11.5 million ecu at constant 1975 prices. That figure has increased three times.  I would ask the Minister where that money has gone?  Does he really know where it is?  I will give him an idea as to where some of it has gone.  In this little agricultural country of ours there is one establishment known as Irish Cement Limited who have a quota for 500,000 gallons of milk and got £280,000.  Shame on the Government and the previous <Col N="1767" /> Government that allowed that company to get £280,000 in this country where farmers are going on the dole every other day and who are using their land to make a living.</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have been afraid to offend any of the various conflicting interest groups involved and have failed to come up with a clearly focused development policy for Irish agriculture. We have natural advantages to allow a prosperous, vibrant and well organised farm industry to compete successfully in more open markets, and for too long Irish farmers have been weaned on a diet of State hand-outs instead of the idea of an enterprising, efficient community. I call for the support to go directly to the small and medium size farmers.  That is the only way there can be an equitable distribution of the vast amount of funding coming from the European Community.  For that reason now is the time to do something specifically and specially for those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the motion the ESRI would carry out an economic analysis of the effects of the current proposals in Europe as regards agriculture. Unfortunately, Deputy Deasy did not suggest what period it would take the ESRI to carry out such an analysis and make a report on which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who ever they would be at that time, could be briefed to canvass support for our country in the various European countries.  Would that not be closing the stable door when the horse is gone or does Deputy Deasy think that such an analysis could be carried out in a very short period?  If that could be done then I certainly would be in favour of it.  Very often such analyses take the best part of 12 months.  If that was the timescale involved it would defeat the whole purpose of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also proposed that an all-party Dáil committee be set up and this is something with which I agree.  Over the past 18 months I have heard from many different sources that an all-party committee <Col N="1768" /> should be set up to solve certain problems. I do not think that so far any such committee has been set up.  Perhaps it is daydreaming to think that this will be an exception, even though it is a good suggestion.</P>
    <P>According to Teagasc &mdash; the body which provides advice on agriculture to farmers and other bodies &mdash; if the current proposals came to fruition they will cost the Irish farming community approximately £1,000 million and lead to a reduction in farming numbers of 20 per cent.  The employment scene is not the greatest at present, with almost 250,000 unemployed.  If 20 per cent of farmers go out of business that will have the effect of putting almost 100,000 people extra on the dole.  That is hardly the most desirable situation.</P>
    <P>There must be something seriously wrong in the world when in one part millions of people are dying of starvation and yet countries, such as ours and other European countries, are penalised for producing food.  Perhaps the day will come in the not too distant future when some organisation, similar to the World Health Organisation will be set up for the purpose of providing a more equitable distribution of wealth and food.</P>
    <P>No doubt changes will come about in the Common Agricultural Policy but whatever changes are brought about there should still be support for the small farmers and the farm families who have been listening to much talk about preserving the farm families and the farming communities from many quarters over the last decades.  Perhaps those older people here will remember those things being said in their younger days also.  This is time for practical support for such an event.  In addition to supporting the small farms, factory farming should be curtailed even to the extent of withdrawing financial support from produce produced on such farms.</P>
    <P>European agriculture should be such as to meet the economic and social needs of the Europeans and not the political demands of the US and other GATT partners.  We should have free trade <Col N="1769" /> within Europe.  We should have Community preference whereby goods produced by European farmers would get preference over imported goods and also there should be financial solidarity where funding would be provided for the different countries from the EC budget and not from the national budgets.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Deasy for sharing his time with me.  It was only while listening to the debate this evening that I realised why the Government have no intention of repairing our county roads.  It was evident listening to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food that the Government believe that in a few years time 50 per cent of the people who live down those roads will be gone. and there will be no need to repair them. That is the message I have taken from this debate.</P>
      <P>Before Commissioner MacSharry went to Europe he was known here as &ldquo;Mac the Knife.&rdquo; He got into the fast lane in Europe by driving a self-propelled harvester through the small farmers of the EC.  As a country with 15 per cent of the total population depending on agriculture I do not believe we should have to accept constraints imposed on us by the European Community when no other country is being asked to accept these constraints in the GATT negotiations. We have quotas but they have none. Some proposal should be put forward in this respect at the negotiations.</P>
      <P>It has been said on a number of occasions that food will be cheaper as a result of the proposed changes.  Food will be cheaper until the competitors are got out of the way and then prices will rise again.  As the only island nation in Europe we should be fighting for derogations to help our small farmers.  It is possible under the proposals that there will be a 50 per cent reduction in the number of people on the land here between now and the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> In a very worthwhile PR exercise Commissioner MacSharry tried to give the impression that money would be taken from the bigger farmers and given to the smaller farmers.  Every farmer will be affected in some way by these proposals. Commissioner MacSharry has said that we must curtail the efficient farmers. Indeed, some Members of Fianna Fáil have said we must curtail the efficient farmers.  If they do this they will be killing off the goose which has laid the golden egg here over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the number of jobs outside of agriculture which will be lost under the present proposals.  It is estimated that 22,000 jobs will be lost in the textile industry and that jobs will be lost in every city and town here.  Why have the social partners and the three farming organisations not got together and worked out the number of jobs that will be lost?  It has been estimated that between 40,000 and 60,000 jobs will be lost here and that most of them will be outside the agricultural sector.  What are the Government doing about this?  Are they prepared to have a meeting with the social partners to discuss this issue?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the effect these proposals will have on our economy. Since 1986 we have gone into surplus mainly because of the value of agriculture to our economy.  If the proposals as we know them are accepted we will have a deficit for a long time to come.  I do not think people realise that these proposals could cost our economy between £400 million and £700 million.</P>
    <P>I support this motion.  Commissioner MacSharry is in the fast lane and he has forgotten where he came from.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food should say that we cannot accept the proposals, leaked or not.  As we know from experience, Commissioner MacSharry leaked documents long before they were ever accepted.  They may have been modified a little but the effect was very severe. He is doing the same in regard to these proposals.  The Government are not protecting the interests of the majority of people here on this issue.</P>

      <P>It is a great pity that there is not all-party consensus on this motion.  It is not a political motion.  We did not come in here to condemn the Government or the Minister; we came here to be objective. An all-party Dáil committee should have been set up to discuss this issue with all the interested groups in the farming sector.  Such a committee would be invaluable.  It is about time Members of this House and, in particular, the Government adopted an adult approach and consulted all the interested groups. Our country is too small, our Parliament is too small, our nation is too small and we are too few in a number to be divided on issues like this.</P>
      <P>The Government have not taken the advice of the most professional group in Ireland, the ESRI, on this issue.  They are more professional than any other research group I know of and their reputation is considerable.  As I have pointed out before, the EC regularly commission them to carry out surveys and analyses of this kind.  Yet we will not avail of their expertise.  As I am well aware, the same quality service is not available within the Department of Agriculture and Food. We need the best possible advice on this major national issue.  As many as 50,000 jobs are at stake and there is a danger of damage being done to our economy.  We cannot allow this to happen because of our inefficiency, hang-ups and inability to compromise with each other in this House.  We cannot hope to achieve what we need to achieve with a totalitarian system.  The Government do not have all the expert opinion, the brains or the knowledge.  This is too big an issue to make it political.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Foxe raised a query about the length of time it will take the ERSI to complete this study.  There is inspired information which indicates that the Commission will bring forward the <Col N="1772" /> official reform proposals by June.  Therefore, any analysis will have to be completed by June, the official deadline. Deputy Foxe made some helpful comments in regard to an all-party committee. Such a committee are necessary.</P>
    <P>We need to get away from the concept of bashing the Government, the Minister or whoever.  So far as I can see, all the bashing on this occasion has been done by the Fianna Fáil MEPs who have disgraced themselves.  Anyone who has dared to question the proposals put forward by the Commission has been harangued, abused and insulted.  As late as today I read in the paper what MEP Killilea had to say.  Every second day we have the same thing from MEP Paddy Lane, a former President of the IFA. This is a disgrace.  Every Member of the House understands the seriousness of the issue and those people are being totally irresponsible.  They are weakening and damaging Ireland's case.  We should not have to put up with this.</P>
    <P>I was very taken by Deputy Clohessy's statement.  He has faced up to the issue. I only hope that the Progressive Democrats will exert their influence within the Government to ensure that an objective study is carried out and an all-party committee are set up to study the matter.  As he rightly pointed out, there is a crisis and it is up to all interest groups in the agricultural sector to get together and solve the problem.  That is what is needed.  We do not expect the Progressive Democrats to vote with us on this motion, but perhaps they can exert sufficient influence and leverage within the Government to see to it that a proper defence of our case is made.</P>
    <P>The proposals have been put forward. The document exists and it was leaked deliberately.  It is a favourite ploy to float ideas and leak documents to see what the response will be.  The Government should act immediately on the basis of the document and not wait until June.  By their silence, there is an acceptance of that document.  I ask the Minister here tonight to bring that message back to the Government.  We believe there should be strident opposition to these proposals.</P>

      <P>I should like to reaffirm what I said before Private Members' Business, that this side of the House is very disappointed that the Minister has not seen fit to accept any of the amendments we put to him in relation to the annual report.  The Minister indicated that this was a standard form of drafting in the context of provision for annual reports for organisations and institutes with this kind of responsibility.  We on this side of the House expressed some surprise that the Minister would be satisfied with that.  Perhaps the history of the Bill warrants a little more time than was given.  Members of the Nuclear Energy <Col N="1779" /> Board, now to be transformed into the Radiological Protection Institute, come from a background very different from what ideally one might have expected. With due respect to all the members of the board who I am sure, have their own tradition, a tradition marked in their history by secrecy and hostility to public inquiry, they would require some transformation to deliver what one would expect from such an institute.  The Minister might instead have looked to the National Pensions Board, recently set up under the aegis of the Minister for Social Welfare.  They, in order to allay concerns which relate to the substantive point here decided that a report is of value only to the people it is meant to protect, in that case members of pension schemes.  The Minister for Social Welfare accepts in that situation that certain specific requirements should be written into that Bill to ensure the members are adequately protected.  I regret the Minister here has adopted a different approach.  The public will need a great deal of reassurance that this agency are being asked to perform a new and very different task, without very clear instructions to perform that task adequately.</P>
      <P>It seems that we are going to have a vote on this and if we could have a single vote that would be desirable.  We are willing to accept Deputy Garland's amendment to the amendment and then, perhaps, our amendment, as amended could be accepted.  Is Deputy Garland agreeable?</P>

      <P>Perhaps we can have a single vote on the composite issue if the Minister will co-operate.  Alternatively, if he had time in the last hour and a half to consider his position he may be willing to accept the amendments.  I accept the point he has made and we will have no problem if he is willing to accept these amendments.  Due to an oversight on our side, the matter to which he referred was not included in our amendment when we reintroduced it &mdash;&ldquo;As soon as may be <Col N="1780" /> after the end of each financial year.... but not later than 6 months&rdquo;.  I accept his criticism.  We shifted ground a little during Committee Stage and maybe things were not handled as tightly as they might have been.  If there is to be public confidence in this Bill these provisions must be very tight.</P>
      <P>What can there be to fear?  I cannot envisage an occasion or a time in the future when the matters referred to here would not be relevant to an agency given this responsibility.  Notifications under section 34 of major accidents will be an ongoing concern.  The current state of preparedness of the national radiological emergency plan is very relevant on an ongoing basis.  The arrangements for disposal of radioactive waste would be an ongoing concern.  &ldquo;Any other such information&rdquo; is a general, catch all phrase.</P>
      <P>The monitoring of radioactivity would provide vital information which should be available.  The Minister tells us this information will be made available, and that any agency will make it available.  If that is so, what is wrong with specifying it in the Bill?  The Minister has given some examples and I will give another. To ensure a basic level of information which is required to ensure that the persons concerned &mdash; in this case the broad mass of the Irish people &mdash; are getting the protection they want, this should be specified in the Bill.  Deputy Garland has dealt with the issue of the gifts, etc. and I share his view of its significance.  We will be seeking a vote on this amendment if the Minister is still obdurate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 15, to delete lines 37 to 46.</P>
      <P>This amendment has been tabled in order to prevent the Minister from tying the hands of the board.  The whole section has been carelessly drafted since different meanings can be taken from it.  Subsection (3) (a) of section 17 states:</P>
      <P>(3)  Not less than 3 months before the end of each financial year of the Institute, it shall furnish to the Minister a report in writing&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) outlining its proposed activities (other than day-to-day activities) in the financial year immediately following.</P>
      <P>Naturally they will suggest what they hope to do the following year but they cannot project what will happen that year, whether there will be another Chernobyl or whether a nuclear submarine will crash off the Wicklow coast.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) (b) provides that the institute shall give estimates of their expenditure in the last mentioned year in relation to each of those activities.  I cannot understand that and I hope the Minister will explain it.  What is the last mentioned year and is there a separate last mentioned year in relation to each activity?  Subsection (3) (c) provides that the institute shall give estimates of their incomes in the said last mentioned year. I propose to delete the remainder of the subsection which states that the institute shall not carry out any of those activities or incur any such expenditure until the report has been approved of by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the House, especially Ministers, are aware that a Minister's approval is a very unpredictable thing. The Minister could give his approval <Col N="1785" /> immediately or he could say he needs more time, perhaps up to 12 months.  A new Minister could be appointed and he would have to look at the matter again before giving his approval.  Does anyone have any idea when the report will be approved by the Minister?  It is a rather meaningless provision unless the Minister inserts a provision to the effect that this will be given within a specified period of, say, two or three months.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) states:</P>
    <P>The Institute shall not during any financial year&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  carry on any activity (other than a day-to-day activity) not specified in the report under subsection (3)  of this section in relation to that year, or</P>
    <P>(b)  incur expenditure in relation to any activity in excess of the estimate of that expenditure given in that report,</P>
    <P>without the prior approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is hogtying the institute under the Minister's control.  The independence of the institute is again in jeopardy.  This section, in the hands of a particular Minister, could remove all independence to carry out activities or incur expenditure. To be independent the institute should at least have a budget and they should be able to incur any expenditure they wish within the terms of that budget.  If they had further income, as provided for in section 17, they could even go beyond their budget provided they had the income to cover the expenditure.  As it stands, unless the Minister allows them to incur expenditure in excess of the estimate, they are completely tied down.  It is very important for Ministers to know the projected income and expenditure for a year, yet the Minister for Finance will admit that the greatest experts never get it right.  The figures flow up and down, mostly up.  There are difficulties every year in budgets.</P>
    <P>Very little care has been taken in the drafting of this section to assess the effect <Col N="1786" /> on the activities of the institute of tying them down to submitting this report three months before the end of the financial year, then restricting them from carrying out any proposed activities or incurring any proposed expenditure without the approval of the Minister.  I wonder how the Minister can stand by that section and still stand by his firm commitment to an independent board.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Minister must not look at this section from the point of view of his intentions, which we all accept are honourable.  He must consider the possibilities the section offers to any other Minister who may not like the composition of the board or individual members of it, or what the board are doing and who wants to place restrictions on the board or to tie their hands in relation to particular activities or expenditures.</P>
    <P>This section gives wide powers to the Minister to tie them up in knots.  For example, by not approving their report over a long period he would thus leave them inactive in relation to their activities and their expenditure.  He could approve their report in relation to their activities but not approve of their expenditure.  If the board have a budget why should a Minister have to have a tie on expenditure? He can hold them to the budget. Surely it is a common occurrence for an institute to engage in activities and incur expenditure in excess of the estimate. They should be allowed to do so.  In the event of an unforeseen accident or a crisis expenditure may be incurred outside what had been projected.  One would expect that the Radiological Protection Institute would be involved in assisting where a crisis occurs.  If everything could be foreseen there would be no problem and there would be no accidents.  There would hardly be a need for the institute if one could predict what will happen from year to year.</P>
    <P>We are really dealing with the unknown.  We are surrounded by a sea used by nuclear powered ships and submarines which may carry nuclear missiles and we have to deal with that.  There are <Col N="1787" /> also nuclear stations and nuclear processing plants located 60 miles off our coast to the east.  Accidents may occur and have occurred from time to time.  We cannot place this type of a restriction on the institute.</P>
    <P>In my amendment I am proposing that we delete lines 37 to 46 on page 15, that is the end of the sentence of section 17 (3) and all of subsection (4).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Our amendment is on similar lines to Deputy MacGiolla's.  It tries to remove powers the Minister has taken on himself to restrict the institute in the preparation of reports, the carrying out of activities and the establishment of priorities.  Deputy Mac Giolla has given an exhaustive presentation on the possibilities and probabilities and our concerns about the section.</P>
      <P>In the course of our discussion on our last amendment we expressed our concerns and we have the same concerns in relation to this amendment.  The role of the Minister is still overly restrictive. Regrettably the Minister does not appear to have moved on this.  The power of the institute to engage in and initiate various activities is restricted by the Minister. This restriction could easily be deleted and this would leave the institute with increased flexibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister was unwilling to accept our earlier amendments but this amendment is of major signficance.  Perhaps the Minister will be more willing to look on this amendment more favourably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of repeating myself I want to re-emphasise that the success of this Bill will depend on public confidence.  The most important thing that must arise from the passing of this Bill is that the public have confidence in its provisions.  How can the public have confidence in the institute if they are not clearly independent?  The amendment will make the institute as independent as they could be.  If the Minister refuses to accept the amendment he is confirming the arguments put by this side of the House that the Bill as it stands does not <Col N="1788" /> express a level of independence acceptable to the general public.  The institute must be free to do what they think necessary and must be unfettered by political control or interference.  The section as it stands could result in political control or interference of the institute.</P>
      <P>I appeal again to the Minister to accept this amendment because it will strengthen the Bill and engender greater public confidence in the institute.  It will prove also that the Minister is as determined as we are to ensure that the institute are completely independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unusual section to say the least.  A supposedly independent free-ranging institute are being set up and the Minister rightly hopes we will have a Radiological Protection Institute which can examine and monitor radiation, deal with impending dangers and in which the public can have full confidence. This section is unnecessary and the wording is quite loose.  For example, the words &ldquo;other than day-to-day activities&rdquo; in section 17 (3) (a) could give rise to an argument with the staff of the institute. They could argue that something is part of their day-to-day activities while the Minister might argue it is over and above their day-to-day activities.</P>
      <P>For the sake of argument let us say that another accident like Chernobyl happened on 25 November of a given year, and the institute's budget was running out, they would have no power without getting permission and more money to examine the effects of such an accident. That is farcical.  It is unnecessarily restrictive and I do not believe it is in keeping with the genuinely held views of this Minister, who has seen his way to make and accept a number of amendments to improve the Bill, nor is it in keeping with the role he would like the institute to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now entering uncharted waters.  We are coming to that part of the Bill which was not dealt with in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find subsections (3) and (4) rather puzzling.  On Second Stage the Minister did not elucidate the reason for these <Col N="1789" /> subsections.  Deputy Owen referred to the distinction between proposed activities and day-to-day activities.  I would appreciate if the Minister would explain the difference.  Subsection (3), which Deputy MacGiolla wants to delete, requires that the institute shall not carry out any of these activities or incur any such expenditure until the report has been approved of by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It seems reasonable that the report must be in three months before the end of the year.  A review of the institute's budget for the following year takes place. In that three months the Minister has an opportunity to do this.  If the Minister fails to approve of the report, where are we?  Does the institute cease to exist or do its day-to-day activities continue but its proposed activities, whatever they are, cease?  It is not at all clear.</P>
    <P>With regard to subsection (4), I think I can see what the Minister is getting at. He is concerned &mdash; and we all must be concerned &mdash; to try to control Government expenditure whether it be in this area or anywhere else.  Perhaps it is reasonable for the Minister &mdash; and I would reserve judgment on this subsection pending his reply &mdash; to have to give prior approval to any excesses in the budget.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Owen who mentioned the possibility of a major emergency such as the Chernobyl one.  It is arguable whether the institute should have an immediate go-ahead or should have to go back to the Minister for more money.  If this section is passed as it is in the Bill the Minister will certainly need to be on the ball and will need to respond immediately to any request from the institute for further funding in a doomsday situation.  It is up to the Minister to allay fears in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I share other Deputies' concern about the Minister's approach to this section.  It seems that the Minister ultimately has financial control: he does vote money and money will be voted by the Dáil for expenditure by the institute. That is obviously the Minister's financial control on the activities of the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1790" /> However, the Minister is going way beyond normal decision-making in the estimate procedure of deciding on what should be available for expenditure by this institute.  He is insisting on trying this group up in a way that even his own Department probably would not be under his own thumb.  It is now commonly accepted that effective operations of public expenditure and public spending activities require that flexibility be given to managers in the field to switch money from one activity to another if they find that they can make savings in one area and they want to develop another.  The institute is a body we would be particularly keen to see responding in a flexible way as things develop in the radiological protection area and allocating their resources to priorities in a given year.  Indeed the whole function set out by the Minister for the institute of monitoring, of keeping abreast of research, of involving themselves in research requires flexibility in the approach to planning, and it is not reasonable of the Minister to expect that they set out in tablets of stone exactly how they plan to spend the money and then have to come back to him, cap in hand, if they want to change a ha'penny from one area to another.</P>
    <P>The Minister has obviously allowed his Department to lift these sections from some other body and they are wholly inappropriate to the radiological protection institute.  It sounds very like some ready-made formula that the Minister's officials delved out of some previous Act and decided to tack on here.  It really comes out of the same stable as the original section 20 which the Minister also sponsored at the beginning but saw the wisdom of withdrawing from in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider this. He should not seek to wrap up the institute in such an amount of bureaucratic approval that it cannot respond flexibly. He should appreciate, from the way he has to go to the Minister for Finance for approval in triplicate of very minor changes, how much the institute could be <Col N="1791" /> tied up in black knots by the sort of provisions involved here.  It is welcome that the Minister has pulled back a little bit by dropping the reference to the Minister for Finance which originally was in all these sections.  However, he has not gone far enough.  He should look again at these sections and have a simple financial control of the amount the institute would spend, and if they were going to overrun he could come in with a supplementary estimate.  No one would object to that.  It is the restriction of individual activities which is not practical.</P>

      <P>Deputy Garland said that we have not discussed this section before. I was beginning to wonder whether any of the Deputies would recognise that even though we had not discussed it on Committee Stage I had in fact amended it in response to arguments that had been made during the course of the discussion on Committee Stage.  With all due respect to Deputy Bruton, he very kindly made reference to that just at the end.  He was the only speaker who made any reference to the fact that we have already implemented some of the wishes of the Members of the House who spoke on this in regard to the type of controls that were included here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That amendment was significant. I would appeal to the Deputies on the other side not to throw commonsense out the window when making their various arguments.  Some of the suggestions that were made would lead me to believe that the new institute could exist completely separate from this House.  In the case of any State body there is the question of answerability to the House.  For that reason and other reasons I have to oppose the amendments that are being suggested now.  They would effectively mean that the Minister of the day would not have any role in approving the expenditure requirements of the new institute which will, it must be <Col N="1792" /> pointed out, be a non-commercial semi-State body in receipt of direct Exchequer funding.</P>
      <P>To delete section 17 (4), as has been suggested here, would leave the institute with much too wide a brief, give the Minister of the day very little indication of their proposed activities and little guidance as to the financial provisions necessary for such activities.  Therefore, the Exchequer would not be in a position to countenance such activities.  In addition, I would submit that the preparation of an approved annual programme and budget is an excellent planning tool and will ensure that the institute retain a clear picture of their objectives and implement their strategy as efficiently as possible.</P>

      <P>I consider it most appropriate that the Minister of the day should be aware of any major changes to the approved programme and budget of a State body that receives most of its funds from the taxpayer.  However, it is not intended, as seems to be implied here, that the provisions of this subsection be implemented in a heavy-handed manner. I do not envisage any difficulty in approving adjustments to the institute's programme during a year.  Perhaps it is inevitable that changes to the programme necessitating adjustments of expenditure might be necessary in the course of a year in the light of changing circumstances. Indeed, forecasting of future spending, as has been suggested, can be very inexact.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not propose that the institute cannot engage in or are forbidden to carry out any extra activities which may be necessary to fulfil their role.  If Members will refer to section 17 (4) they will see it is clear that the institute can engage in important activities which arise in the course of their work but which are not pinpointed in the report.  However, the institute must seek approval for such activities.  I would submit that that is a reasonable requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla sought clarification of the points raised at section 17 (3) (b) <Col N="1793" /> which requires the institute to furnish the Minister of the day with estimates of expenditure incurred in the last year of the accounting period in respect of activities they propose carrying out in the forthcoming year.  It is merely to give the Minister an idea of what was spent before on particular areas of activity before approving any future expenditure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland made some play of what was appropriate for inclusion in the programme and what might be deemed to be a day matter.  Again, I would suggest that common sense would tell the Deputy what was likely to be appropriate for inclusion in a programme of work for a 12-month period as distinct from a day to day matter.  One would deal in a more general fashion whereas the other would deal in a more specific manner.  I do not think a matter of that kind would raise any great difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable to suggest that the institute should not be expected to lay out, in some general form, what will be their programme of work for the forthcoming 12-month period, particularly bearing in mind their funding by the State.  Otherwise we would be encouraging circumstances in which this House would not necessarily have the kind of answerability necessary in the case of any State body.  One cannot examine this section in isolation and arrive at the conclusion that, because of these requirements, the institute will be inhibited in some way from carrying out their work in the independent manner we have sought to establish.  One has to deal with the Bill <i>in toto</i>.  One must examine the powers being given the institute in each of its sections.</P>
    <P>The conclusions being drawn here are wrong.  It excludes or defies common sense to arrive at that kind of extreme conclusion in regard to the operations of the institute because of the simple requirement stipulated in this section.  I do not see it being the major obstacle Deputies make it out to be.</P>
    <P>I might make the point again that I did amend this section by deleting reference to the necessity to have approval of the Minister for Finance included in the Bill <Col N="1794" /> as originally circulated.  By removing that necessity we have greatly enhanced the independence of the institute, something I have been endeavouring to achieve in the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I have to oppose the amendment suggested.</P>

There should not have been any such reference to him in the first place. It would have been an absolute disaster had reference to the Minister for Finance remained in that section and we would have been lashing the Minister present for so doing.

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and thank him.  However, that is not getting to the nub of the section with which we have been dealing. Nobody has expressed any objection whatever to the idea of the institute making a report to the Minister three months in advance of setting out their proposals for the following year and how much they predict they would spend in that year.  That is an excellent idea contained in section 17 (3) which nobody has suggested be deleted.  However, what I did seek was an explanation of section 17 (3) (b).  The Minister has given an <Col N="1795" /> explanation which is not at all apparent from the wording in the Bill.</P>
      <P>At the outset I said there was some very sloppy draftsmanship here and I repeat it because section 17 (3) (b) states: &ldquo;giving estimates of its expenditure in the last mentioned year &mdash; not in the last year but in the &ldquo;last mentioned year in relation to each of those activities&rdquo;.  If the Minister reads the section he will see that the &ldquo;last mentioned year&rdquo; is the &ldquo;financial year immediately following&rdquo; whereas I take it the Minister meant to insert the last year.  Therefore this section does not mean what the Minister said it means.  In fact, it has no meaning.  In effect it is saying: giving estimates of its expenditure in the financial year immediately following in relation to each of those activities. If the section were to mean what the Minister said it meant, he would have to insert its expenditure in the last year of operation, or some other such words.  I would ask the Minister and the parliamentary draftsman to take another look at that because the &ldquo;last mentioned year&rdquo; is the &ldquo;financial year immediately following&rdquo; contained in the previous subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To revert to the main point, the Minister did not reply to the points made by all the speakers here in relation to the <Col N="1796" /> manner in which the institute are tied already by his budget, why there must be further ties on them in relation to their expenditure of that budget.  We do not see the necessity for the inclusion of section 17 (4) which is the point we have been making.  That is the subsection which ties the hands of the institute in relation to their activities at a time when they must operate within their budgetary income.  We cannot understand why that independence must be hamstrung, that is the primary point we are making.</P>
    <P>We are not objecting to projections for the following year.  That is a great idea but why must all those be restricted?  In the earlier part of this section there is a further restriction where it is stated &ldquo;until the report has been approved by the Minister&rdquo; in which no time limit has been imposed.  I would hope the Minister could put in a time limit on the report from the Minister which shall be not less than three months or something similar. At least, that would put a brake on future Ministers who would want to hog-tie the whole operation by not approving a report.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9)  The Minister shall by order regulate the entry into Irish territorial waters of any foreign State ship, submarine, or hovercraft, and the passage through Irish airspace of any foreign State aircraft by requiring, prior to any grant of permission for such entry or passage, the production of a certificate from the relevant foreign State authority that the ship, submarine, hovercraft, or aircraft in question does not carry any nuclear explosive device.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will recall, we had a considerable debate on Committee Stage when we examined much of the detail behind this issue.  The motivation behind this amendment is that this country has traditionally operated a ban on nuclear weapons in its air space <Col N="1799" /> and territorial waters.  It has been the position of successive Irish Governments that this ban should be strictly observed by all people seeking to enter our waters or use our airspace.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have seen <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the essence of our policy is not being honoured in the letter in many instances.  Greenpeace recently carried out an examination of this issue which produced telling evidence suggesting that our policy was not being observed.  We cannot ignore that finding. This is the first opportunity we have had in this House to debate a Bill which proposes to set up an institute to deal specifically with the protection of people from nuclear hazard as it might affect Ireland.  If it is to have a proper voice on issues of world security Ireland must maintain its deeply held view that there should be no further nuclear expansion and nuclear weapons should be gradually eliminated.  We can underpin this if we take seriously the policy we have adopted that forbids nuclear weapons to pass through our territory.  We cannot declare such a policy in principle and then turn a blind eye to the possibility that it is being breached in practice.  In the context of a European defence policy in future years it will become all the more important for Ireland to stitch clearly into the record its non-nuclear approach to defence.  We can do this in a practical way by underpinning, in a way which operates effectively, our belief that nuclear weapons should not pass through our territory.</P>
    <P>Our amendment proposes that the Minister could, by order, regulate the entry into Irish territorial waters or Irish airspace of foreign craft by requiring, prior to granting permission for such entry or passage, the production of a certificate from the relevant foreign State stating that the craft in question is not carrying a nuclear explosive device.  That certification requirement should not create any great difficulty.  If countries are honouring our policy position &mdash; they know well what our policy position is and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has repeatedly said that our policy position is <Col N="1800" /> being honoured &mdash; I do not think it would be unreasonable to expect them to present a certificate to that effect.  If the Minister wants to exclude certain categories from the certification requirement because he is confident, from their capacity, that these craft could not be carrying nuclear weapons, that would be acceptable to us on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>We should have a certification system in principle to back up the policy position we have long held.  That is the thinking behind the amendment.  As we dealt with the various reports from Greenpeace in considerable detail on Committee Stage I do not intend to rehearse the arguments again.  Reference was also made to the very large number of visits made and to our concern that the policy is not being honoured.  Rather than hold up the House by going into that matter again I hope the Minister on this occasion will see the wisdom of this amendment and accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down this amendment with Deputies Flaherty and Bruton, and it is probably the most important amendment which has been put down to the Bill.  The object of the Bill is to protect the people of Ireland from the hazards of radiation.  However by confining itself to dealing solely with civil radiological protection it turns a blind eye to one of the major sources of possible nuclear accidents, namely, overflights by foreign military aircraft and visits to our ports by foreign naval vessels.  The amendment seeks to rectify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 7,000 foreign military aircraft are given permission by the Government to overfly the country each year while over a dozen ships with nuclear capability have visited our ports since 1987, half of which were officially inspected and cleared to carry nuclear weapons before leaving their home ports. Greenpeace have verified this.  The policy of successive Governments has been not to allow nuclear weapons to be brought into Irish territory.  However when permission is sought for overflights by foreign military aircraft and visits by foreign naval vessels the Government do not ask <Col N="1801" /> if nuclear weapons will be carried on board.  If they did ask, they would not be told because it is the policy of the nuclear powers to neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons on their ships or aircraft.  This is not good enough. If the Minister is serious about protecting the people of Ireland from radiological hazards and against the bringing of nuclear weapons into the country he should give teeth to these policies by accepting this amendment.</P>
    <P>This amendment is effectively supported by The Workers' Party through Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment No. 7, which although different expresses much the same sentiments.  I would imagine that the Labour Party will also weigh in, and therefore this amendment will have the support of all the Opposition parties. The Minister now has the opportunity to display vision and declare Ireland a nuclear-free zone.  What we are seeking is that aircraft or ships carrying nuclear weapons be banned from entering our air space or ports.</P>

      <P>I was going to speak in favour of amendment No. 6 and then take mine later but I will speak in favour of both now.  The amendments are similar, although amendment No. 7 is more specific and contains more detail.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate the Minister did not, as was suggested by a number of speakers on Second Stage and again on Committee Stage, adopt the New Zealand approach and declare the country a nuclear-free zone.  In fact, this city has been declared a nuclear free zone by the city council.  I had the honour to propose the motion some years ago.  Indeed, the motion asked the city council to erect signs around the city including one at the port, stating &ldquo;you are now entering a nuclear-free zone&rdquo; but these signs have never been erected.  Dublin City Council do not have the power to implement such a motion declaring the city a nuclear-free zone but they have declared that that is what citizens of this city want.  The power to do this rests with the Government. Apparently, they have given these powers to the Department of Foreign Affairs who have a responsibility to monitor shipping and aircraft and who have laid down specific regulations which contain the proviso that such vessels &mdash; I take it that this covers aeroplanes &mdash; should not carry nuclear weapons and should not form part of a naval exercise.  I presume this instruction is given to foreign governments and the matter is then taken on trust.  The United States has adopted the line that they should neither confirm nor deny that nuclear weapons are on board. I do not know what position has been adopted by other governments but I presume that they say &ldquo;we are clean&rdquo; and then come in, be they French or British naval vessels.  I doubt if any of them have ever confirmed that nuclear weapons were on board or that a vessel was engaged in a naval exercise.  I presume once a ship leaves the exercise area they can argue that the vessel is no longer engaged in a naval exercise and that therefore they can overcome the instruction issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> Greenpeace have carried out an enormous amount of work in the United States.  Making use of the Freedom of Information Act, they went through all the naval records and presented a report to the Government and Members of this House which shows precisely which ships had nuclear capability and which ones had not, and showing that ships with nuclear capability which entered our ports had left the United States carrying nuclear weapons.  They were not able to prove that nuclear weapons were being carried on board when they entered our ports.  The only ones who are in a position to prove this are the Government by checking every ship with nuclear capability to see whether or not nuclear weapons are being carried on board.  We should not take matters like that on trust. Those ships with nuclear capability, which were known to be carrying nuclear weapons on leaving the United States, should have been checked on entering our ports.  That is what we are seeking here.</P>
    <P>Greenpeace gave a similar report to the Swedish Government.  That Government have the same policy we have, that is, taking Governments at their word and trusting them.  They received the same replies from the United States Government, neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons.  Since the Swedish Government received this report they made a decision that from 1992 they would seek guarantees.</P>

      <P>I took the opportunity of <Col N="1804" /> asking the Minister for Finance to respond in the Dáil to the reported remarks of the president of the West German Bundesbank to the following effect: that he favours a two-speed approach to the question of economic and monetary union.  I have done so for one reason: it is about time someone in Government stood up for what is in Ireland's interest, and a two-speed approach to European union certainly would not be in our best interest.</P>
      <P>There is a temptation always to describe anyone who expresses even a hesitation about EMU as a begrudger or an anti-European.  I strongly believe that it is the good Europeans who must be prepared to fight to develop a vision of Europe that has room for every one of its citizens and that is prepared to address the fundamental problems faced by Europeans who are at a disadvantage. There is a huge difference between being a good European, as I understand it, and a European lapdog.  I am very much afraid that on the Government benches there are far more European lapdogs than good Europeans, more interested in the photocalls that European Councils offer than in making any demands that might give offence to the Eurocrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remarks made by the president of the Bundesbank prove one assertion that we have been making for some time, that work is very far advanced in European circles on the details of what European union will mean.  There are very senior and highly paid European public servants who have already debated and decided, as far as they are concerned, all the principal issues surrounding the establishment of a European Central Bank. They have settled among themselves how much independence and authority it will have and how much it will be able to influence the budgetary and fiscal policies of each State in Europe.  As I said, all these matters have been discussed in detail.  All that remains now is to manipulate the politicians into agreeing with the Eurocrats, and that will be easy as far as we are concerned because here in Ireland <Col N="1805" /> we have never discussed, even in principle, these issues or all the other issues involved.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in this House this morning that it will be the politicians and not the bankers who will decide the future direction of Europe.  Unfortunately, I believe the Taoiseach is deluding himself. Politicians who do not bother to take up and express a position, who do not bother to consult their own communities, who allow a democratic deficit to grow in regard to fundamental issues and who refuse to allow and encourage public education and debate are simply playing into the hands of the bankers.  That is exactly what is happening in this Parliament in the context of this debate.</P>
    <P>I have read the Irish statement of position on this fundamental issue.  It is contained in ten pages of double-space typing addressed in the form of a letter to the president of the Intergovernmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union.  If it were reduced to booklet form it would not fill both sides of an A4 page. What a collection of clichés it represents. According to this document we are in favour of European union, just as we are in favour of virtue; we think more cohesion would be a good thing; it must be on the agenda and it must be discussed, but we have no demands to make in this regard and no mechanisms to put it forward; we want to see the Central Bank accountable, but we have already agreed to the objective of a single monetary policy for the Community, with very tight disciplinary measures on any member who runs a budget deficit; we think something should be done about jobs but there is no mention of an industrial European policy and no demands about the elimination of incentives that attract industry to the centre.  There is just a bland statement that more jobs would be very nice indeed.</P>
    <P>In short, if the president of the West German Bundesbank had written our opening position he could not have done a better job.  I have to ask just who are the Government representing in these negotiations?  Are they completely unaware of the problems of small open <Col N="1806" /> peripheral economies with high unemployment and substantial social problems? Are our Government blind to the fact that Europe must be made to respond to the needs of all its people and not just to the needs of the richest?  When will our Government include the rest of the people in their preparations?

      <P>I am aware of the reported suggestion to which the Deputy refers.  I do not, however, have the full text of the speech of the president of the Bundesbank so I am not in a position precisely to assess the context in which his remarks were made.  Consequently, any comments I have to make are subject to that reservation.</P>
      <P>My first remark is that there is nothing new in what Herr Poehl had to say.  He has, in fact, addressed this theme on at least one previous occasion, but he is not alone in thinking that some member states may not wish to or may not be able to move to EMU as quickly as others.  In this, EMU is not an exception.  There are areas of Community activity where member states who were not ready to assume a particular obligation were allowed to derogate for a period from assuming their responsibilities.  In other instances, a member state's voluntary participation in a particular scheme later than others has been accommodated without great difficulty.</P>
      <P>This latter instance is most relevant to the present case because each member state is free to embrace or reject EMU. The closest analogy to it is, perhaps, the European monetary system.  When this system was set up, not all member states participated in its exchange rate mechanism. Yet it was so structured that those currencies which did not participate initially were able to go into it at a later stage. Indeed, we had the example of sterling's smooth entry last October, more than 11 years since the system was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> The European Council of 27-28 October last also had regard to the possibility that not all member states would be able to progress to EMU at the same pace. With the exception of the UK, that council decided that the second phase of EMU would begin on 1 January 1994 after certain conditions had been fulfilled.  One of these was that the greatest possible number of member states had adhered to the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS.  There could be no clearer demonstration of the practicality of the European Council's view of the present reality and of the way to proceed to EMU. Against that background, it is incorrect to dub as &ldquo;two-speed&rdquo; an approach which seeks to accommodate the capabilities of individual member states to the objectives set in common.</P>
    <P>As for the Government's position, it would be our wish that all member states should progress in step towards EMU. We must, however, recognise the reality of a situation in which one member state may not wish to take a particular path to EMU and one or two others may not be ready irrevocably to lock their exchange rates to those of the remainder member states.</P>
    <P>We are, however, crystal clear as to Ireland's place in the process.  Just as we participated as full members of the EMS right from its inception, we intend to be among the founder members of EMU. It is with justification that we take that stance because our inflation rate is now one of the lowest in the Community, our public finances are in order and our external payments are in comfortable surplus.</P>
    <P>Press reports from Bonn stated that the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, has today rejected the suggestion of the president of the Bundesbank that German monetary union has been a disaster. Herr Kohl told a business meeting that monetary union had been a crucial step towards German unification, adding that social tension was diffused by the timely introduction of the West Germany currency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usual to begin by thanking the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise an item on the Adjournment.  On this occasion, a Cheann Comhairle, I sincerely thank you for allowing me to raise this matter because of the long list from which you had to choose.</P>
      <P>St. Edward's national school, Forthill, Sligo, has 230 pupils and nine teachers, including the principal, a remedial teacher and a resource teacher.  The school building is no longer of a standard acceptable for the purpose of learning or of teaching.  Today it could be seen at its worst with the rain water coming down along the walls following the downpour of the past few days.  The toilets are outdated, the corridors have been designated &ldquo;very dangerous&rdquo; in an IIRS report, the windows are partly rotten, the heating is deficient and the playground inadequate.  These are just some of the problems but the unsuitability of the building is not in dispute and the Department of Education and the Minister for Education accepted that long ago.</P>
      <P>Since the mid-seventies negotiations have been taking place with the Department of Education for a new school situated in the Forthill area and with success &mdash; on paper.  In April 1987 the Department agreed to grant-aid the provision of a new school located at Ballytivnan to cater for the children in the Forthill and Ballytivnan areas.  In February 1988 outline planning permission was received but then there seemed to be an indication that the Department were reconsidering their agreement to build.  An election intervened &mdash; fortunately perhaps &mdash; and on 13 July 1989 a fax was received from &mdash; of all places &mdash; Fianna Fáil headquarters with the following message:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education, Mrs. Mary O'Rourke, has now agreed for provision of essential classroom accommodation to replace St. Edward's National School, Forthill, Sligo.  The new school will be situated in Ballytivnan and will consist of eight new classrooms.  The Minister has further agreed on the planning of the project to proceed immediately.  The <Col N="1809" /> Minister has also said that there will be no undue delay within the Department in the planning and the provision of the school.</P>
    <P>In August 1989 the Department finally gave the message everyone wanted, the building of the school was to start in the summer of 1990.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in April 1987 a new school was officially sanctioned, in July 1989 we were told there would be a new St. Edward's with no undue delay and in August of the same year we were told that the building would start in the summer of 1990.  What happened?  St. Edward's has not yet got from the Department of Education the sketch plans to enable them to apply for full planning permission. Is it any wonder that among the parents, pupils, teachers, board of management and local residents there is disillusionment, frustration and outright anger at what they regard as little better than deception from Dublin?  Is it any wonder that St. Edward's parents' association, with virtually 100 per cent backing, decided to withdraw their children from the school for one day in protest?  That protest was to have taken place on 12 March but it has now been postponed for two months and, if the Department of Education have not delivered the sketch plans to Sligo in the meantime, they will strike on 15 May.</P>
    <P>There was full agreement on the site of the new school and there will be no problem of planning.  Repeatedly, from 1987 onwards, the Minister and the Department said that they will build; what everyone involved now wants to know from the Minister is very stark and simple, when will the building work commence on site?  The preliminary processes can be drawn out or done at high speed, it is all up to the Minister.  Anything other than a firm date for the start of work on the school, which the Minister undertook to build in 1989 with no undue delay, will not wash at St. Edward's.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may have forgotten that just before Christmas I met the principal of the school, Fr. Devine, and a range of parents; at that meeting we set out our schedule of accommodation and how we would go about our business.  I understand that a letter issued to the parents, enclosing a letter of mine, which were very favourably received.  I do not know if the Deputy ever had a meeting with the people concerned but when I met them I clearly said that I was going ahead with the school.  However, I asked for a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  I asked that the multi-denominational school would receive favourable consideration from the Catholic diocesan authorities where there would be an exchange of spare school buildings in the Catholic diocesan trust and under their aegis.  At that meeting Fr. Devine undertook to use his good offices to do that.  He is a grand man and most approachable and, as I am keeping my side of the bargain, I hope that he, with the episcopal authorities and the bishopric, will look after the matter. There is a need for the multi-denominational school to be looked at as it is all part of the overall school needs for this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much committed to St. Edward's national school.  I met the principal, Fr. Devine and the members; I reiterated in a letter that the architectural planning for the project is in hands and all <Col N="1811" /> is proceeding according to arrangement. As I said, during the Deputy's time in office nothing was done about this school. I thank him for raising it on the floor of the House tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you most sincerely for giving me the opportunity of raising this very important matter.  It is clear that the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Agriculture and Food have been dragging their feet in relation to this important question.  I deplore the action of the Minister and our Agriculture Commissioner in Brussels for the incompetent manner in which they presented Ireland's application for the extension of the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In an interview which John Cushnahan, MEP, and I had with the Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, in Strasbourg on 23 November, 1990, Mr. MacSharry promised that the fate of thousands of Irish farmers who hope to be included in the extension of the disadvantaged areas would be known in three weeks from that date.  That was reported in a reputable national daily paper.  It is now four months since the Commissioner gave that promise and there has still not been a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk, is on the record of the House as saying that Ireland's application would be finalised during our term of the EC Presidency which expired on 30 June 1990.  What has happened since?  Everybody knows that Italy held the Presidency since then and that we are now half way through the Luxembourg Presidency, but no action has been taken on Ireland's application, which is a disgraceful state of affairs.  Paddy Lane, a reputable Member of the European Parliament, <Col N="1812" /> gave an interview in the <i>Farm Exam</i> on 1 February 1990, over 13 months ago.  He stated in the <i>Farm Exam</i> on 1 February 1990 that this would be a St. Patrick's Day gift.  Nothing has happened since. Another St. Patrick's Day has come and gone and no action.</P>
    <P>It is high time the Commissioner in Brussels, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the MEP apologised for misleading Irish farmers.  Why has it taken over three years to present Ireland's application and get a decision on it?  Why keep thousands of Irish farmers in limbo waiting to know if they are included in the extension?  It is clear that a half-hearted commitment on the Government's part, coupled with a bungling approach by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, has resulted in thousands of farmers losing out for two years on badly needed financial assistance.</P>
    <P>It is now vitally important that the appeals procedure the Minister is supposed to be setting up be totally independent and conclude its deliberations as quickly as possible.  It is very hard to understand why Ireland's case has been deferred for so long.  It was clear once the criteria were laid down for the extension of the disadvantaged areas that it was only a matter of applying for that extension.  The criteria for the areas to be included are a stocking rate of less than one livestock unit per hectare, that less than 7.8 per cent of the area be ploughed land and the family farm income per male farm worker in the area not exceed 80 per cent of the national average family farm income per male farm worker.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Sheehan raised this matter in the House.  It gives me an opportunity to respond to the case he has made.</P>
      <P>When we made our case to the EC Commission last June for the extension and reclassification of Ireland's disadvantaged areas I must confess I hoped that we would have a decision on the matter by now.  To a certain extent, therefore, I can sympathise with Deputy Sheehan's impatience in relation to this issue.  I am just as impatient as he is because I do not like to see people in limbo any more than he does and I would like to see a final resolution of this matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis the decision is not one that we can make in Ireland and it is one, therefore, that is outside our control. To the extent that it is within our control &mdash; by which I mean the speed with which we respond to the various technical queries raised by the EC Commission on the submission &mdash; I can assure Deputy Sheehan and the House that the Department of Agriculture and Food have responded to those queries as quickly as it was possible to do so, have had a number of meetings with the EC Commission whenever requested by the Commission and have dealt with a large number of detailed queries in an expeditious and effective manner.  Now that we have given the Commission full replies on all the points raised by them the ball is back in the Commission's court and I am very glad to let the Deputy and the House know that we should see a Commission proposal next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay and the queries raised by the Commission are not due to any mistakes or delays on our part.  We made our submission on the basis that the maximum number of areas would be included.  That meant including all areas which together could be shown to meet the criteria.  We pushed the boat out as far as we could. This, of course, inevitably meant the Commission examined the case very carefully and queried a number of matters. We could have taken the easy way out and submitted less and the examinations would have taken less time but, at the end of the day, it was surely better <Col N="1814" /> that we sought the maximum extension and reclassification.  We are now confident that we have satisfied the Commission in regard to most of their queries and that virtually all the cases we have submitted will be accepted.</P>
    <P>Some more general queries have been raised at a higher level by the EC Commission recently following completion of consideration of the technical queries and a meeting is being held with the Commission tomorrow to consider those general queries.  At that meeting we shall be urging the Commission to expedite our case for extension and reclassification so that it can be presented in the very near future to the EC Council of Ministers.  Next month we are to get a proposal from the Commission on this.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, in relation to people losing out, I can assure the Deputy that any applicants under the disadvantaged areas schemes who have land in the areas covered by the extension and reclassification proposals finally agreed by the EC will have their cattle, horses, sheep or goats inspected administratively or in the field so that payment of 1991 disadvantaged areas grants can be made on those animals to any eligible applicants.  This, of course, will mean that certain inspections will have to be carried out on a provisional basis pending the final EC decision on extension-reclassification.  I reiterate that it does mean that we are not allowing the delay in obtaining an EC decision on our submission to get in the way of making payments to eligible applicants in the new areas in 1991.</P>
    <P>We have established a commission composed of totally independent and objective people and any areas that, at the end of the day, feel hard done by or left out can make their case to that independent body for inclusion.</P>

      <P>A problem has arisen in Connemara with ewe premium inspection which started only today, 14 days behind the usual starting time.  As the hill flock in Connemara begin to lamb in the second week in April it will be impossible to gather flocks after that date for inspection.  With 25,000 ewes in Connemara I expect that, unfortunately, only about half the flock will be inspected by that time.  If so it will mean a loss of the subsidy because those farmers could not then collect their sheep.  Unlike lowland flocks with small lambs, it is impossible with flocks of 200, 300 or 500 to collect the sheep with the lambs.  The lambs would be separated from their mothers and would die as the result.  Farmers will not be able to collect their flocks for the inspections.  Therefore, I am appealing to the Minister, in respect of hill flocks not inspected by the second week in April, to pay the owners on application.  If not about £250,000 in subsidies will be lost.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me the opportunity to raise this matter.  The administration and disbursement of EC free beef has left a trail of grievance and a sense of injustice throughout the country.  A long litany of social welfare categories such as old aged pensioners, contributory and non contributory, widows and orphans, blind pensioners, people on disability benefit and invalidity benefit, deserted wives and DPMA recipients to name but some have been omitted.  Only four categories have been included, those on long term unemployment assistance excluding small holders, pre-retirement pensioners, <Col N="1816" /> long term supplementary welfare allowance recipients and FÁS trainees who are long term unemployed excluding smallholders before starting with FÁS.  Why has there been discrimination against smallholders who are excluded in every case even though they may be in receipt of the full rate of unemployment assistance?  When one considers the surplus of beef in the EC, much of it almost given away to countries outside of the Community, it is impossible to understand why so many deserving categories have been overlooked.  Will the Minister explain what criteria was employed when deciding on who should be included and who should be left out?</P>
      <P>I compliment the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for undertaking the distribution of the beef on a voluntary basis.  They do the job with the discretion and sensitivity that only their personnel with their vast experience of such work could achieve.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise the question of the closure of Rathduff cheese factory which is located in the rural part of my constituency, with a projected loss of 80 jobs.  This closure is occurring because of the rationalisation moves by the parent company.  The rationalisation is because of the amalgamation between Ballyclough and Mitchelstown Co-ops.  I regret the loss of the 80 jobs as a result of this amalgamation.  There has been a serious conflict as between the evidence put forward by the co-operatives and an attempt has been made to make Cork County Council the scapegoats on the basis of effluent discharge.  I am not trying to blame the Minister.  I am appealing to him for the sake of the 80 jobs in Rathduff to intervene.  It would be a tragedy for the area which has high levels of unemployment if those jobs were lost.  Most of the people who will lose their jobs will find it very hard to find replacement jobs.</P>

Will the Minister spell out exactly the present position with the talks that have been going on between the Government and the German group who are interested and tell us also what the status is of the talks that have been going on with the US group?  Cork had a 5 per cent increase in unemployment in the last year and it cannot tolerate further job losses.  There is widespread fear and anxiety among the families of workers in Irish Steel because of the uncertainty over the last 12 months.  Out of respect for the families the Minister should tell us exactly what is happening.  Talks took place between the unions and the Minister last week. We were told that there would be 86 jobs lost and that there would be an investment from the Government, but the House deserves an explanation for the sake of the people in Cork.</P>

      <P>The closure of the cheese factory in Rathduff would devastate the local community.  The workers and suppliers have given long and loyal service to Ballyclough and it is not acceptable that because of the merger they must now be sacrificed for economic reasons.  The Minister and the board should ensure that fair play is given to workers.  We talk about preserving rural Ireland and rural communities.  This is an opportunity for the co-operative and the Minister to respond in a positive way to a genuine need.  The Minister should take this matter seriously and in consultation with the co-op should ensure that fair play is given to the workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed closure of Rathduff cheese factory within the context of the amalgamation of Ballyclough and Mitchelstown Co-ops can be viewed as part of the rationalisation process which the Irish dairy sector is currently <Col N="1818" /> experiencing.  The necessity for this reorientation in approach has been recognised by the ICOS in their 1987 document &ldquo;A Strategy for the Irish Dairy Industry&rdquo; which recommended the establishment of three milk processing units.  The IDA &mdash; Department of Agriculture and Food paper &ldquo;A Future in Food&rdquo;, also published in 1987, has similarly emphasised the importance of rationalisation to the future prosperity of the industry.  The amalgamation of Ballyclough and Mitchelstown Co-ops has to be judged in this context.  The reorganisation of the industry now taking place should facilitate the creation of new employment opportunities in the medium term on the basis of a more competitive processing structure within the industry as well as securing the jobs which currently exist.</P>
      <P>I will now move to Deputy McGinley's question in relation to the supply of intervention beef to the most deprived persons in the Community.</P>
      <P>Each year a specific financial allocation is made for each member state under this scheme and the quantity of beef available is strictly limited in line with this allocation.</P>
      <P>Ireland's allocation for 1990 was £3.3 million which covered some 100 tonnes of beef to be supplied to hostels/day centres run by voluntary organisations and some 650 tonnes of beef for distribution to social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>To include all social welfare recipients would not be possible, so in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare specific beneficiaries are identified.  The decision was made to restrict the scheme in 1990, as in previous years, to recipients of long term unemployment assistance excluding smallholders; recipients of pre-retirement allowance; recipients of long term supplementary welfare allowance; and FÁS trainees who were in receipt of long term unemployment assistance immediately prior to doing their courses.</P>
      <P>With the very considerable co-operation of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul some 120,000 of the most needy &mdash; identified using objective economic criteria &mdash; received food which they would not have otherwise obtained.  It is planned to continue the same method of distribution for beef in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1819" /> I will now take Deputy McCormack's question in relation to the problem of the inspection of the mountain ewe flock for premium payments and the difficulty this presents for a number of flock owners in Connemara.</P>
    <P>The position here is that this scheme is 100 per cent financed by the EC and they can lay down all the rules and regulations governing it as they see fit.  When the proposal requiring notification within ten days of each loss or sale of ewes was brought up at the Sheepmeat Management Committee, Ireland accepted that it might be a reasonable requirement in member states where only relatively small percentages of flocks are inspected, but argued forcefully that it was totally unnecessary in a situation where every applicant's flock was inspected each year without fail.  What was the point, we asked, of getting in a mountain of paper notifications when we would in any event discover all sales and losses at inspection in every case?  We asked for a derogation from the notification requirement for any member state carrying out 100 per cent field checks but unfortunately the committee simply took the majority view from all the other member states who have partial inspections only and put through the regulation without our suggested amendment.  Even if they had accepted our amendment, a derogation from the need to notify losses or sales up to the inspection date would not have released flock owners in Ireland from the need to notify us of losses or sales between the inspection date and the end of the 100-days retention period on 9 June.  It is important to note that notification of losses must be within ten days of discovery of the losses rather than within ten days of the losses themselves. This EC provision recognised the difficulty facing mountain flock owners in reporting losses within ten days.</P>
    <P>We are very anxious to get various messages across to sheep owners this year <Col N="1820" /> about changes in the schemes &mdash; the fact that if they apply on more ewes than they have, they will be ruled out of two years' schemes, the fact that they cannot sell eligible ewes during the 100-day period, the fact that they must notify us in advance if they wish to change their sheep grazings and so on.  We want to get these messages across to them to save them from making mistakes and losing premiums. I can assure the Deputy that we are doing everything possible at European level to simplify this scheme but we have to abide by Community regulations.</P>

      <P>Irish Steel are trading satisfactorily in a very difficult international environment. Following years of loss making, the company made modest profits during the past two financial years and it is hoped a profit can be returned in the current year also.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of a sale of the company, the Government are still convinced that the viability of the company, especially for the longer term, can best be ensured by association with a strong external partner.  Efforts to find a suitable partner have not so far proved successful but these efforts are continuing.</P>
      <P>Quite separate from the question of sale, it is of course essential that the company take all necessary steps to maintain and improve their competitiveness. To this end, the company are proposing a package of rationalisation measures covering reductions in costs, including payroll costs, more flexible working arrangements and more appropriate pay arrangements.  This package includes proposals for 96 voluntary redundancies. There will, of course, be full consultations between the company and the trade unions in relation to these proposals.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 March 1991.</P>

      <P>In 1988, Aer Rianta commissioned a survey to identify the number of houses which would be affected by the coming into operation of the new runway.  Ninety eight houses were identified as coming within the internationally accepted noise intrusion limits.  The cost of providing the necessary noise abatement protection, <Col N="1551" /> including double glazing and roof insulation, was estimated to be approximately £500,000.</P>
      <P>Following extensive consultation with householders affected, Aer Rianta agreed to implement a scheme for house insulation which is substantially better than any comparable scheme in the UK. The cost of this scheme will be approximately £750,000 as against the £500,000 originally envisaged.</P>
      <P>A majority of the householders affected have accepted the scheme and have had their houses insulated.  The feedback from these householders is satisfactory.

      <P>The provision of cost effective and efficient public transport services is one of the Government's priorities.  Since taking office, I have consistently emphasised the need for cost economies within the CIE group's operations to contain the costs of public transport and enhance its overall attractiveness.

The task force have already put in place some 15 kilometres of bus lanes and other important bus priority measures and its further proposals to significantly increase priority for buses are at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
      <P>As I have previously indicated to the House, a number of major public transport projects are under consideration including the provision of a diesel commuter service from Clondalkin to the city and the examination of public transport options for the former Harcourt Street line and Tallaght.  The Dublin-Maynooth commuter line has also been significantly upgraded recently with the provision of four new stations at Confey (Leixlip), Coolmine, Castleknock and Broombridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I am also in the process of preparing legislative proposals for submission to Government <Col N="1554" /> for the liberalisation of bus services with a view to encouraging greater competition between public and private transport bus operators.  This legislation is intended to facilitate the development of new and enhanced public transport services both in Dublin and throughout the country generally and to achieve greater use of public transport services by the general public.</P>

      <P>This is primarily a matter for RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE report that the provision of TV and radio reception coverage throughout the Republic is difficult particularly in coastal areas due to the topography of the country, and that 100 per cent coverage is <Col N="1555" /> virtually impossible by terrestrial transmitters.</P>
    <P>RTE provide TV reception from a total of 46 high and low power transmitters scattered throughout the country.  In addition a further 35 community owned self-help systems extend coverage to small isolated pockets of poor reception. The population coverage is in excess of 98 per cent for TV coverage, 97 per cent for FM radio coverage and AM medium wave is in excess of 99 per cent.  However, the quality of reception varies from excellent to fair to poor in some remote mountainous areas.</P>
    <P>The remaining pockets of poor TV reception are mainly in north Wicklow, west Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Monaghan and Tipperary.  RTE are continuously extending and improving the network in areas where reception is not as good as RTE would wish it to be.  The pace of this development is directed by the availability of capital financing.</P>
    <P>On radio coverage, RTE operate a total of 21 medium wave and VHF-FM transmitters.  A programme to extend and improve VHF-FM stereo reception is continuing.  Areas of priority, where FM reception is at present less than adequate are mainly in Cork, Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Monaghan, west Waterford and the midlands.  RTE medium wave reception is generally adequate, particularly during daylight hours. Reception on medium wave during the hours of darkness, however, is restricted in some areas, particularly in Kerry, Cork, Mayo and Donegal.</P>

      <P>While the past nine months have brought major difficulties for both air and sea carriers, and have threatened the continuing provision of competitive access facilities, I am satisfied that Ireland continues to offer a range of competitive route alternatives for prospective tourists.</P>
      <P>I am assured that Aer Lingus, Ryanair and British Midland have adequate capacity to fill the gap created by the British Airways withdrawal and will provide extra flights if required.  In addition, as part of my policy of improving access to Ireland, I have recently given my approval for a number of new scheduled services which will be in operation for the coming summer season.  These include a KLM service between Amsterdam and Cork, Loganair between Knock and Manchester, Alitalia between Milan-Rome and Dublin, Viva between Malaga and Dublin and Aeroflot between Miami-Washington and Shannon.</P>
      <P>Air charter services between mainland Europe and Ireland will be well up on last year with particularly strong growth in charters from France.  New agreements governing UK flights are likely to increase competition on these routes from which Ireland can benefit through back-tracking traffic.  I have also had discussions with a number of North American airlines about their extending existing services or starting new services to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surface access from Britain is showing improvement on last year with Sealink Stena adding capacity on the central corridor through the introduction of a new vessel on the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire <Col N="1559" /> route, while quality on the southern corridor is being upgraded by the reintroduction of the <i>Celtic Pride I</i> by Swansea Cork Ferries.  No significant capacity changes over 1990 will apply on the continental corridor.  Irish Ferries did endeavour late last year to obtain a third car ferry for the 1991 summer season, but these efforts did not prove successful. The company will, as in previous years, deploy a freight only vessel, in order to commit their two car ferries exclusively to tourist business during the peak period.  My Department will continue to closely monitor capacity on this route.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government share the very widespread concern about the serious environmental damage caused in Kuwait during the occupation of that country and the potential consequences at global level.  A large number of oil wells were set on fire and are still burning; and there was a deliberate release of crude oil into the waters of the gulf with consequences for the entire ecosystem and for the supply of drinking water for the inhabitants of the region.</P>
      <P>The countries of the region have sought the assistance of the international community; and they have indicated that they will require technical advice and special equipment to combat the fires and the spillages rather than financial support.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any proposals to establish a specific United Nations fund to deal with the damage caused. However, the international community has been very active in its efforts to alleviate the serious consequences for the environment.  UN specialised agencies involved include the International Maritime Organisations, the UN Environment Programme and the World Health Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Monday last, 18 March, the EC Ministers attending the Environment Council in Brussels were briefed by the Minister for Health of Bahrain who is acting Secretary of the Regional Organisation for the Protection of the Marine Environment.  He identified the oil well fires and the resulting acid rain as the most serious problem; and he estimated that these fires could take from 18 months to three years to extinguish, depending <Col N="1568" /> on the degree to which the oil companies could divert their expertise from other, existing commitments.</P>
    <P>Following this briefing, the Environment Council discussed the situation. It decided that there should be a co-ordinated Community response in full co-operation with the countries of the region, with the specialised agencies of the UN which I have mentioned and with the European oil industry which have expertise which could be used in dealing with the fires at the oil wells.  Technical expertise could also be provided to deal with oil spillages through the task force which exists in the Community to combat oil spillages in Community waters.</P>
    <P>I believe that Ireland can help most effectively through its support for this co-ordinated action by the European Community in the co-ordination of which the EC Commission will of course have an important role.</P>

      <P>I understand that, under EC rules to reduce air pollution from motor vehicles, cars under 1,400 ccs must comply with certain emission standards by end-1992; generally speaking, compliance will require that they be fitted with catalytic convertors.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the attachment process is one of a number of enforcement options which combine to underpin the tax collection operation.  Enforcement action is embarked upon by the Commissioners following the issue of various demands for payment and in the absence of a realistic response from the taxpayer. In the case of attachment a final demand is invariably issued to the taxpayer allowing ten days for payment and pointing out the prospect of attachment in the continued absence of payment.</P>
      <P>Any taxpayer, irrespective of his occupation, who ignores his obligations over a period of time is liable to become the subject of action by way of sheriff seizure, judgment proceedings or attachment. The Revenue Commissioners consistently advise taxpayers in financial difficulty to address their liability prior to the stage at which enforcement action must be taken and thus avoid the trauma and financial cost associated with enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" /> It is, of course, open to the taxpayer to make a direct approach to the Revenue Commissioners following the issue of an attachment order.  In such situations the order is, in general, left in place until a realistic and acceptable scheme of payment is put in place.</P>

The commissioners and adjoining land owners have shared responsibility for ensuring that boundary fencing is adequate to prevent all farm-stock straying.  In this regard the commissioners have an ongoing programme for fence maintenance and improvement. The commissioners are not aware of any local unease caused by poor fencing.</P>

      <P>As total slaughtering capacity, export and domestic combined, exceeds the national kill the current policy having regard to the optimum use of public funds, is to direct support to projects which are oriented towards value-added processing which would create employment and enhance the value of exports. Grant aid is not, therefore, available to abattoir owners supplying the domestic meat market.  The Abattoirs Act, 1988, provides for any ungrading of domestic abattoirs to be carried out gradually, if necessary over a five-year period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> However, as I have previously advised the House, the fundamental cause of high motor insurance premia in Ireland is the high claims rate which, regrettably, is on the increase, allied to the high cost of individual claims which is also rising.  One cannot reasonably expect the price of motor insurance to reduce, or even stabilise when the claims rate and costs of claims are increasing.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>
      <Quest>whether his Department have carried out any survey of the early employment experience of young workers in view of the widespread concern that such workers are being exploited by low pay and rapid turnover; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Every year my Department undertake a sample survey of the post-education experience of young people.  Its primary purpose is to trace the career paths of students leaving secondary level education in a particular academic year in terms of the proportions entering the labour market, going onto third level education or emigrating.  The survey does not address the specific issue of pay or labour turnover among the sample surveyed.</P>
      <P>A number of research projects have been carried out in relation to the question of low pay.  The most recent one entitled &ldquo;Low Pay in Ireland&rdquo; (February 1991) was commissioned by my Department and was carried out by Mr. Brian Nolan, Senior Research Officer, Economic and Social Research Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> The research indicates that about 50 per cent of those workers falling under a number of low pay thresholds are young workers aged under 25.  Low paid full-time workers tend to be concentrated in the categories of unskilled and semiskilled manual workers, lower grades in clerical and office employment and general indoor sales staff.  These also are areas which are normally associated with high levels of labour turnover.</P>
    <P>The issue of low pay arose in the discussions on a new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  During the currency of the agreement the Employer-Labour Conference will consider all the issues involved, including the operation of the joint labour committee system, in regard to a statutory minimum wage and prepare a report for consideration of the constituent bodies of the conference.</P>
    <P>I have improved the enforcement of employment regulation orders and as a result the arrears collected in 1990 have increased by over 40 per cent over the arrears for 1989.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1990, contains a number of measures which are designed to facilitate the establishment of JLCs, to improve the functioning of existing JLCs and to bring about more effective enforcement of employment regulation orders.  In addition, one of the functions of the new Labour Relations Commission will be to carry out periodic reviews to determine whether new JLCs should be established or existing JLCs extended.  These changes will ensure that the joint labour committee system functions efficiently and effectively and adequately addresses the problem of low pay in certain sectors.</P>
    <P>An application for the establishment of a JLC to cover the retail grocery and allied trades is currently under consideration by the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>It is open to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or any individual trade union to apply to the Labour Court to have a joint labour committee established.  An application by the Irish Distributive and Administrative Trade Union and the Irish National Union of Vintners, Grocers and Allied Trades Assistants for the establishment of a JLC to cover the retail grocery and allied trades is currently under consideration by the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>A number of draft directives applicable to my area of responsibility have been proposed in the context of completing the Internal Market.  Details are as follows: A Council Directive 90/377/EEC concerning a Community procedure to improve the transparency of gas and electricity prices charged to industrial end users was agreed during the Irish Presidency and was adopted on 29 June 1990. A Council Directive 90/547/EEC on the transit of electricity through transmission grids was discussed and agreed during our Presidency and was adopted on 29 October 1990.</P>
      <P>A proposal for a Council directive on transit of natural gas was considered during the Irish Presidency and a common position was reached on the proposal in May 1990.  It is expected that it will shortly be adopted.  A proposal for a Council directive providing for appropriate measures to be taken in the event of difficulties in the supply of crude oil and petroleum products to the Community and a proposal for a Council directive laying down detailed implementing rules with regard to oil stocks have recently been put forward by the Commission to the Council for consideration. Discussions on these proposals are at an early stage and it is not possible to indicate a precise time scale for their adoption or otherwise.</P>

    <P>A proposal for a Council directive in the context of Conservation of Energy, concerning the efficiency requirements for new hot-water boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels, was submitted by <Col N="1602" /> the Commission to the Council in October 1990 and is under discussion.

      <P>The total number of old age contributory and retirement pensioners at the end of 1990 was approximately 123,000.  The number has increased by 14 per cent in the decade 1980-90.  Pension cover was extended to self-employed persons in 1988, and is now being extended also to part-time workers.  These developments will ensure a continuation of the upward trend in recipients of contributory pensions.  As a consequence the numbers who will have to rely on a non-contributory pension will continue to decline.</P>

      <P>I fully share the Deputy's abhorrence of badger baiting.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda will continue to ensure that any reported cases of badger baiting are fully investigated and are brought to the notice of the Director of Public Prosecutions, where appropriate. Towards this end they will continue to liaise with officers of both the Wildlife Service and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the Garda have no evidence to suggest that the practice of badger baiting still occurs to any significant extent in this country and that while a number of alleged incidents of such activity have been investigated by them, there have been no prosecutions for any such incidents in the past five years.</P>

    <P>At present, goods vehicles with unladen weights greater than 1.5 tons, which are over one year old, must be road-worthiness tested annually.  Any vehicle which initially fails this test must be repaired and passed as roadworthy before the vehicle concerned can be relicensed to carry goods on a public road. Imported used heavy goods vehicles over one year old must be tested and passed as roadworthy before being fully licensed to carry goods.</P>

      <Quest>if he has studied the consultant's report which recommends the construction of a new bridge over the River Shannon at Hartley, Carrick-on-Shannon straddling the Roscommon and Leitrim boundaries; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the existing bridge has been designated as highly dangerous; and if he will confirm that funding will be provided in the current year to Roscommon and Leitrim County Councils to commence work on the new bridge.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the condition of Hartley Bridge and of the consultant's report commissioned by Leitrim County Council.  The bridge does not form part of the network of national roads and the cost of any work carried out by the local authorities concerned would normally fall to be financed from the authorites' own resources supplemented by the discretionary grants for non-national roads. In 1991, the discretionary grants allocated to Leitrim and Roscommon County Councils amount to some £4.8 million. The selection of works to be carried out with these grants is a matter for the local authorities subject to general guidelines issued by the Department.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the level of funds available for special grants for non-national roads and the priority of other projects throughout the country, I do not propose to make a special grant in this case.</P>

      <P>The Palmerstown-Ballydowd dual carriageway was completed in 1984 and the landscaping provided was in accordance with accepted standards at the time.  The landscaping of the Western Parkway, which is now in progress, will involve some additional planting in the vicinity of the interchange with the Palmerstown-Ballydowd scheme.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the present financial requirements for major improvement works to national primary roads in the Dublin area, I do not propose to allocate funds for additional landscaping of the Palmerstown-Ballydowd road at this time.</P>

      <Quest>if, having regard to the substantial impediments to the free flow of traffic which are caused by illegal parking, he is prepared to alter the system of parking fines, which are now computerised, so as to provide for a sliding fine rate to discourage the persistent and habitual offender with the doubling or trebling of the fine for a person who has more than five or ten parking fines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The penalty to be imposed for a <Col N="1623" /> parking offence is a matter for the particular court acting within the limits of the maximum penalties provided for in section 102 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended by section 2 of the Road Traffic Act, 1984.</P>
      <P>The maximum penalty for a first offence is a fine of £150.  For a second or subsequent offence the maximum fine is £350.  If, however, in any period of 12 consecutive months, a third or subsequent offence occurs, a period of imprisonment, not exceeding three months, may be imposed in addition to, or as an alternative to, a maximum fine.</P>
      <P>The level of maximum penalties provided for in the Road Traffic Acts generally is being considered in the context of a review of those Acts being carried out by my Department.</P>
      <P>It would be impracticable to apply a sliding scale of on-the-spot fines.</P>

However, at the same time, I indicated that prescribing was not likely to have been widespread because, from the early sixties, it was medical practice that the use of drugs in the care of women in the areas of gynaecology and obstetrics should be kept to a minimum.

    <P>Decisions regarding the future of girls leaving the centre would normally be taken by the courts who would have regard to the outcome of the assessment and the recommendation of the centre. In the majority of cases, the girls would be placed on probation and either return home or to accommodation provided by health boards or voluntary organisations. In a minority of cases, the court may recommend a further period of remand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the meeting of the EC Council of Transport Ministers held on 17 December 1990, the Commission presented an outline plan prepared by a high level working group on the development of a European high speed rail network. At the meeting I supported the Council's decision to approve the outline plan on the basis that peripheral member states like Ireland should be given special treatment in the field of transport infrastructure and that the resolution of access transport problems is vital in the context of the Single European Market.  In Ireland's case, our geographical position and distance from Community markets impose significant competitive disadvantages on our economy <i>vis-á-vis</i> other member states.</P>
      <P>The outline plan approved by the Council is of particular importance to Ireland and addresses the possibility of the upgrading of the Cork/Dublin/Belfast rail line to cater for speeds of the order of 160km/h.  In addition, the Holyhead/Crewe rail line is one of the vital links in the transport chain between Ireland and the rest of the Community and, at our request, the question of improvement in the line is to be the subject of a special study by a working group.</P>
      <P>With regard to Iarnród Éireann transtrack business, I have been informed by the chairman that the company are in the process of reorganising their transtrack groupage business and that freight services will be terminated at some smaller depots where volumes are uncommercial at present.  The question of reducing staff numbers associated with this reorganisation is a matter for Iarnród Éireann as part of the company's ongoing attempts to achieve improved competitiveness and financial performance of the rail freight business.  It is understood that discussions with relevant trade unions concerning the new arrangements are underway at present.</P>
      <P>The transtrack reorganisation has no bearing on the EC high speed railway proposals.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to MMDS services.  When MMDS comes on stream throughout the country it will have the capacity to carry 11 channels.  Apart from TV3, which they must carry, the services which are made available will be a matter for the MMDS operators.  It is likely, however, that they will offer a range of services including the four UK terrestrial television channels and some satellite channels as a basic service with premium services such as a film channel at an added charge.</P>
      <P>Charges for MMDS services are primarily a matter for MMDS operators. They are expected to be in the region of £100-£125 for connection and a similar annual charge thereafter.</P>
      <P>Television viewers in certain parts of the country can receive UK services directly off-air or viewers can also receive satellite channels with the appropriate equipment.  The cost of these is a matter between the viewer and his television dealer.</P>
