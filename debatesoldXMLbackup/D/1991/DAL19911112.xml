    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to questions on 16 October last, I stated that plans for a meeting with the British Prime Minister would be <Col N="978" /> announced, in accordance with established practice, simultaneously in Dublin and London close to the time of the meeting. That remains the position and the newspaper report referred to by Deputy J. Bruton does not alter it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that the decision to hold the meeting was announced publicly in the agreed communiqué issued following my meeting in London on 21 June last with the British Prime Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any decision been taken to have a meeting on a particular day or even in a particular month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, as I told the Deputy, when the day is decided it will be announced in both capitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If no decision has been taken to have a meeting on a particular day or month what was the Government Press Secretary talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government Press Secretary was simply repeating what had already been said publicly in London by both myself and the British Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem that the Government Press Secretary has again overstepped his responsibilities in this matter.  Will the Taoiseach say whether there has yet been an agreed date fixed between himself and Mr. Major, the British Prime Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that in reply to Deputy John Bruton.  I must repeat that the Government Press Secretary simply repeated something that the British Prime Minister had publicly announced in London in June, namely, that it was decided that a meeting would be held in the autumn prior to the Maastricht Summit in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the statement made by the Government Press Secretary, and subsequently by the <Col N="979" /> Taoiseach within his own party, was that a meeting had been fixed to meet Mr. Major and that this was part of his agenda before the Maastricht Summit.  I am asking whether there were any discussions with the British authorities at this point to establish the date for such a meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither I or anybody else said that a meeting had been fixed. What we said was it had been agreed to have a meeting before the Maastricht Summit.  That was announced in the communiqué in London.  In fact both of us indicated it in a public press conference in London outside Downing Street but the question of fixing the exact date of the meeting is still under consideration and will be announced in due course in both capitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Government Press Secretary conveyed the impression, perhaps not willingly, that the meeting had been arranged, will the Taoiseach say whether the British authorities have been in contact with his office or the Government Press Secretary to give a date or make a date available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the position is that both offices have been in touch and are reviewing possible dates.  The governing factor is the Maastricht Summit.</P>

      <asker>Mr. J. Bruton</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will give details of the bilateral official meetings which have taken place, since 16 October 1991, with the social partners in regard to the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Bilateral discussions at officials' level between the Government and the social partners commenced on 16 October last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The officials have met with trade union and employer organisations representatives each on four occasions and <Col N="980" /> with farmer organisations representatives on one occasion.</P>
    <P>The social partners have been briefed on the developments in the domestic and international economies and on the impact of these on the Exchequer finances and on the economic projections upon which the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was based.</P>
    <P>The discussions cover a wide range of issues with the focus on what contributions the Government and the social partners, as partners in the programme, can make in order that the overall objectives of the programme can be met.  These objectives essentially are to maintain the low-inflation competitive economy the Government and the social partners have together successfully established over the past four years.</P>
    <P>The discussions at officials' level are ongoing but, arising from them, meetings between members of the Government and the social partners are envisaged in due course.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the discussions will be taken into account by the Government in completing the Estimates and the budgetary preparations for 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say what is the deadline for the conclusion of these meetings in so far as they concern the Estimates for 1992 given that there are five working weeks only remaining in 1991?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The process is that the discussions between the social partners and the Government will be carried on contemporaneously with the preparation of the Estimates, but it is essential that the discussions with the social partners be completed before the Estimates are finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Government have indicated their intention to publish the Estimates before 1992, would the Taoiseach say when does that mean that the talks with the social partners must conclude?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be concluded <Col N="981" /> as expeditiously as possible.  It is not possible for me to give a firm date at this stage.  As I have said, the programme is to continue the discussions between the social partners because the outcome of those discussions will have an impact on our budgetary preparations.  The intention is that the discussions with the social partners will be completed in time to enable the Estimates be finalised in accordance with our normal time-table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach whether, arising out of his first reply, all of the social partners have agreed the Government analysis of the deterioration in the economic position internationally, in particular, whether the Government have requested the trade union movement to consider renegotiating the pay components of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>?  In addition, would he say whether such an agreement is conditional on the Estimates being completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The general format of the discussions are as I have outlined here on a number of occasions.  They are to indicate to the social partners the deterioration which has taken place in our rate of economic growth and, as a result, in the public finances.  I am not aware that there is any substantial area of difference between any of the social partners and the Government on the general parameters of that picture.  I can only repeat that the intention is to pursue as actively and expeditiously as possible discussions with the social partners; in those discussions, to review the prospects for 1992 and, correspondingly, the impact developments in 1992 will have on the budgetary position and on the targets set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government conveyed formally to the social partners, particularly the representatives of Congress, the view of the Cabinet as expressed by the former Minister for Finance that the Government are not in a position to meet all the conditions of <Col N="982" /> the pay agreement in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>?  Is the acceptance of that indication by the Congress conditional on the Estimates being completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the final part of the Deputy's supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love an answer to the first part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly deal with the first part.  The position is that the Government are outlining as fully as possible to the social partners the major difficulties which confront us in the preparation of the Estimates and in preparing the 1992 budget.  Naturally public service pay is an essential element of that discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has stated that the intention is that the discussions with the social partners will be completed in time to enable the Estimates to be published before the end of the year.  Is that the intention of the Government or is it an intention which is shared by all the social partners as well? Is it a joint intention or a Government intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is primarily the Government's intention because it is the <Col N="983" /> Government's duty to prepare the Estimates and make preparation for the budget.  The social partners are fully aware of the Government's need to have the review of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for 1992 completed so that the Estimates can also be completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated in his reply that the objective is to maintain a low inflation competitive economy. What discussions have taken place and what progress has been made in addressing the fact that we have 260,000 people unemployed?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

      <Quest>if he has any plans, in conjunction with the Central Statistics Office, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, to arrange for the publication, on a regular basis, of quarterly data on gross national product in order to improve the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, the Central Statistics Office publish a wide range of monthly and quarterly economic indicators.  These provide comprehensive information for significant areas of the economy such as prices, industrial performance, retail sales, unemployment and the nation's external trading position.</P>
      <P>In the national accounts area, the immediate priority is to improve the timeliness and quality of the annual accounts and to provide a more extensive range of sectoral information than has hitherto been possible.  There are no plans, at present, to compile the national accounts or data on gross national product on a quarterly basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State not agree that having regard to the dispute over the interpretation of the performance of the economy for the first nine months of this year, it would be in everybody's interests, and particularly in the interest of the Taoiseach in trying to negotiate with the social partners, if clear and undisputed data in relation to the performance of GNP and GDP were available to all parties in a manner similar to that in the United States where they get quarterly statements of growth or non-growth as distinct from annual statements here?  Would he not agree in the context of the difficulties we have that it would be in the interest of the Government and the CSO to move towards providing for the publication of such statistics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Publishing such figures <Col N="985" /> on a more regular basis would not necessarily mean greater accuracy.  It is to the contrary.  Six member states of the Community publish such figures on a quarterly basis and their experience has not been satisfactory.  There have been substantial revisions to the initial quarterly estimates when the more reliable annual information has become available at the end of the year.  The experience in other countries where they publish accounts on a quarterly basis is certainly not satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To begin with, neither <Col N="988" /> I nor the previous Minister for Finance have met the board of Greencore, but Deputies will be aware that my representative left the board in no doubt, at the recent EGM about my dissatisfaction with the initial handling of recent events. Deputies will also be aware that my dissatisfaction with the way the board of Irish Sugar handled some not so recent events was also expressed.</P>
      <P>As the largest single shareholder in Greencore, I am of course concerned about events which may have an adverse impact on the company, but it is gratifying to note that despite recent events investors have maintained their confidence in the company.  I want to take this opportunity to reaffirm my belief that Greencore is a sound company with further potential for development and I want to work with all other shareholders towards this goal.</P>
      <P>You, Ceann Comhairle, and Deputies will be aware that there are ongoing investigations by court-appointed inspectors and we should not attempt to prejudge the contents of the inspectors' reports.  As information becomes available the necessary decisions can be made and actions taken.  Since Greencore is a public company it is important that I, as a major shareholder, act in concert with all other shareholders for the benefit of the company.</P>
      <P>I have received the report from my representative who attended the EGM of Greencore and that report was presented to Government.  The Government decided that the Minister for Finance should meet the chairman to convey certain concerns felt by Government. Deputy Reynolds met Mr. Cahill on Thursday, 7 November, and reiterated the Government's concerns regarding the severance packages offered to certain executives of Greencore, as well as the valuations of the 49 per cent of Sugar Distributors Holdings Limited at the time of the management buy out and 15 months later when it was acquired by Irish Sugar.  It was agreed that there will be a further meeting with the chairman when the inspectors' reports are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> I have also received the report of the Central Bank into certain transactions connected with the SDHL affair and this has been made available to the inspectors.

In light of the report presented today by the inspectors appointed under the High Court and presented to the Minister for Industry and Commerce last night, may I ask the Taoiseach if the Government think that the taxpayer was well served by those in authority in the sugar company at the time?</P>

These payments were made immediately on completion of the sale of the shares.  The Exchequer also received interest on various moneys subscribed in the periods between publication of the Offers for Sale and the dates of completion of the sales.  The costs of consultancy and financial services in connection with the sales were borne on Subhead A2 of my Department's Vote.

The Act to which the Deputy refers in his question deals with <Col N="992" /> the actual sale of semi-State companies or any other State assets.  In so far as that is concerned, I can assure the Deputy that all proceeds and possible income from the sale were made available to and immediately lodged into the Central Fund account.</P>
      <P>I could not go so far as to say that it is not in order for a semi-State company to consider aspects of their future financing, such as privatisation, part-privatisation or taking in shareholders from the private sector.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 30 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>Circular 1/83 provides guidelines on the practice to be followed in appraising and managing public sector capital expenditure projects.  The terms of the circular apply to State bodies as well as to departmental expenditure.  It is the responsibility of each sanctioning authority to ensure that specific procedures adopted in its area of control comply with the basic principles set out in the circular. The Department of Finance were assured by Departments, subsequent to the issue of the circular, that its terms were being observed.  The circular is, in fact, under review in the Department of Finance at the present time, and may require some updating.  I might add that this review commenced before recent events.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputies' questions regarding the supervisory roles of the Department of Finance and other Departments <i>vis-à-vis</i> State companies, I presume that in using the term &ldquo;companies&rdquo; they have in mind all State bodies, including those which are boards and authorities.</P>
      <P>First, let me say that there are already in existence a number of mechanisms designed to assist both the Department of Finance and parent Departments in exercising their supervisory roles <i>vis-à-vis</i> the State sector.  In carrying out this role care has to be taken, particularly in the case of commercial bodies, that the principle of the autonomy of these bodies in their day-to-day operations is not diluted.  There is a fine balance to be drawn here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No system is perfect, however, and all <Col N="994" /> call for review from time to time.  In the light of recent developments the Deputies may be aware that the Secretary of the Department of Finance was asked to examine this whole question, and to report his findings and recommendations. He has done so, and his report is being examined by the Government. When we have completed this examination, the Government intend to prepare and implement updated guidelines for the semi-State sector.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I could not agree with that.  The matter has been fairly widely and thoroughly discussed and debated over recent weeks.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would the Taoiseach not agree that none of the inquiries, whether under the court or otherwise, are examining the accountability of any individual Minister?  Would the Taoiseach not further agree that if his two Ministers, and his former Minister for Finance, were not grossly negligent, then the terms of Circular 1/83 were in place and all these Ministers would have been informed of the purchase of the Johnston Mooney and O'Brien site and would have been informed of the various transactions carried out by Greencore?  Consequently, if they were not negligent in putting these procedures in place they were grossly <Col N="995" /> negligent in not acting on the basis of the information provided through these procedures that were in place?</P>

The question of the Ministers' supervisory accountability is one really for this House but I do not think this House can address the question of supervisory accountability until such time as it has available to it the inspector's report or reports.  When the House has those reports then they will be in a position to raise here in this House, on an authoritative basis, any points they wish to raise in regard to the accountability of any Ministers in their supervision of the State bodies for which they have responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State of the Department of Finance (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>The stately homes, or great houses of Ireland, are primarily in private ownership but a considerable number of them are open to the general public.  It is not State policy to acquire buildings such as these, save in the most exceptional circumstances. Every year hundreds of thousands of visitors from both at home and abroad enjoy viewing these properties.  With the ever-increasing demands on the public purse, private ownership is usually the most realistic method of conserving this significant feature of our historical and architectural heritage.  The attractive tax reliefs which are available provide an important incentive to the owners of stately homes contemplating refurbishment and opening to the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Minister that the cheapest method may not be the most satisfactory one.  Responsibility for stately homes in Ireland seems to be divided among a number of agencies.  Would the Minister consider setting up a national trust, similar to that in Britain, rather than having three bodies such as the National Heritage Council, Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works trying to work out a solution or a strategy which is not satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out, the proposed acquisition of such houses would have to be viewed in the light of competing demands emerging from diverse interests and also from Finance's area.  The Office of Public Works have considered a number of requests from time to time but decided, in the interests of the taxpayers, that it would not be economical.  Indeed, very generous tax concessions are allowed to private owners of such houses if they are open to the public for at least 30 days in the year.</P>

      <P>Surely, that is a pennywise, pound-foolish type of policy.  It has been proven in Britain, in particular, that such stately homes are a tremendous tourist attraction if they are properly organised.  Would the Minister consider adopting a similar co-ordinated policy in this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">

      <P>The present system operating has been quite satisfactory. There is no obvious indication at present that a body such as that suggested by the Deputy should be set up, but if it was felt there was a need to consider that I am sure the commissioners would be happy to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 27 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>The disposal of the properties in question was entrusted to the Commissioners of Public Works, who were instructed to engage selling agents in the private sector for this purpose.  No committee was set up to supervise the disposal.  The decision to include House No. 24 in the sale was taken in July 1991.</P>
      <P>Agreements have been reached for the sale of the properties for a sum in the region of the asking price of £4.5 million which was fixed following consultation with the selling agents.  The contract preliminaries in connection with the sale of the properties are currently being settled by the agents.  I am satisfied on the advice of the selling agents that the sale price is acceptable, given the current state of the market for Georgian buildings and the strict preservation conditions incorporated in the conditions of sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three supplementary questions to put to the Minister of State.  First, how long were the committee in existence which deliberated on the future of those buildings &mdash; I understand an official from the Department of the Taoiseach was the chairperson of that committee?  Second, what is the gap between the recommended market price and the figure that was given to this House in respect of the contribution which the disposal of those properties would make towards the refurbishment of Government Buildings next door?  Third, to what extent are the Commissioners of Public Works responsible for the substantial physical deterioration of the building?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I will deal with the last question first.  There are still a very small number of staff working at present in the building.  To date, it is costing somewhere in the region of £115,000 to keep the building in a reasonably good condition.  Nevertheless it is felt that unless the buildings are disposed of fairly quickly, it could cost in excess of £2 million to carry out the minimum works.  With regard to the first question, <Col N="1000" /> the committee, to which the Deputy refers, were not to investigate the possibility of sale but to look into the possibility of how these offices or buildings might be used by Government for Government purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the gap between the price and what was hoped for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware these buildings went to auction.  The offers made were not considered satisfactory; No. 24 was not included at that time but was subsequently added to the list.  The commissioners feel that the price offered at present &mdash; in the region of £4.5 million &mdash; is quite satisfactory in view of present market prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has replied that £4.5 million was the actual valuation put on the property.  This certainly runs counter to the type of money that was expected by the Taoiseach in financing the Government buildings project. What offer is on the building at the moment and does the Taoiseach think that the original valuation will be achieved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already informed the House that the offer has been accepted, and that the transaction which is at present being completed by the respective agents is in the region of £4.5 million.  The Taoiseach did not indicate at any time that a specific price would be paid for those buildings.  The Taoiseach indicated that it was hoped to obtain a very good price for the building which would help in comparison to the overall cost of reconstructing the new Government buildings.  It was never said that we would be offered any specific price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that as a result of a triangular process of warfare between the Taoiseach's Department, the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works, the State, in the form of the taxpayer, has missed the boat in relation to realising the <Col N="1001" /> maximum value of those properties which would have been close to £7 million or £8 million?  Are lessons being learned from this fiasco to avoid repetition in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn will know that the cost of a building to a prospective buyer is obviously based on what would be required in relation to planning conditions and so on.  There is a preservation order on the Houses, both inside and outside and obviously that would have an effect on the commercial value.  In the circumstances, the commissioners are satisfied that the offer that has been accepted is satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 15 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Economic Review and Outlook 1991&rdquo; published in August projected a GDP growth rate for this year of about 1.75 per cent and, depending on the scale and timing of profit outflows, GNP growth of about 1.25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> Since then the recessions in the UK and in the US seem to have bottomed out but, while the latest forward looking indicators in the UK are encouraging, signals from the US are more mixed. On the domestic front exports and, by implication from revenue recipts, non-agricultural employment are continuing to hold up, while business confidence is reported in the recent CII survey to have improved.  However, trends in personal consumption and constuction employment remain weak.</P>
    <P>On balance, there would appear to be no reason to expect this year's growth rate to differ significantly from that outlined in &ldquo;Economic Review and Outlook&rdquo;. This would leave growth here broadly in line with the EC average but, in terms of GNP, would represent approximately a halving of the budget day forecast of 2.25 per cent.  This lower growth essentially reflects the effects of weakened international confidence on business investment, and of a related weakening in domestic confidence on personal consumption and construction. Irish economic fundamentals remain sound.</P>
    <P>Lower growth has had a direct impact on the budget arithmetic.  The impact on indirect tax receipts was particularly marked both because a lower than expected volume of personal consumption represented a significant part of the total growth shortfall and because the fall-off in consumption was particularly concentrated in expenditure on motor vehicles.  Together with the unexpectedly sharp increase in the number on the live register as migration patterns changed, this is one of the main reasons the current budget deficit for 1991 is likely to be in the region of £400 million, some £150 million above the budget estimate. This is broadly in line with the Government's expectations on 19 July last when introducing a corrective package to deal with the emerging situation. I am satisfied that in this very difficult year the current deficit has been contained within reasonable limits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach <Col N="1003" /> accept the fact that on almost every occasion when the Government and independent economic forecasters have differed during the course of this year, the Government have been wrong?  Does he agree that even the Central Bank has been, and is certainly now, continually less upbeat than the Government?  Is the Taoiseach in his capacity as Minister for Finance aware of a particular forecast by one firm of stockbrokers that suggests that having regard to trends in Britain we are likely to reach unemployment levels of the order of 325,000 by mid-1993 and that unemployment is likely to reach 300,000 by next autumn?  Having regard to that nightmare economic scenario, does he not agree it is incumbent on us now to use all the energies available to the State and the social partners to devise some assault on this appalling unemployment prospect?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On this occasion as we all know, the forecast on which the budget was based, 2.25 per cent, was in the middle of a range of forecasts given by different commentators and experts at that time.  The unavoidable falling off in economic growth during the year could not possibly have been anticipated at the time the budget was being framed.  We have been over all that ground.  The position now is that in spite of the difficulties that arose during the year and in spite of some of the nightmarish forecasts regarding the Exchequer borrowing requirement for the current year, things will come out reasonably good and the overrun of £150 million is far less than would have been trumpeted by various supposedly well informed commentators and experts during the course of the year and up to quite recently.  I strongly advise Deputy Rabbitte to be cautious in this area because it is very much a question of estimates and forecasts and any estimate or forecast can only be made on the basis of the facts available and unexpected developments can throw any forecast off.</P>

I will be glad to supply the Deputy with the full text of the answer I would have given to the priority question <Col N="1006" /> if the Deputy had not played into injury time.</P>

They have forecast in their report zero <Col N="1007" /> growth and a projected unemployment figure of 325,000.  I am not being outlandish. I am merely asking the Taoiseach what is his rebuttal of that.  Does he not, in any event, accept that the decline in economic growth has the most serious implications for our unemployment pattern, that there now is an unemployment crisis and that all of us in this House should focus our attention on trying to alleviate it in some fashion?</P>

      <P>First, I have given my assessment and the assessment of the experts at the disposal of the Government that the forecast we made last July of 1.25 per cent GNP for 1991 will be adhered to.  I have also made it clear to the Deputy that, despite all the falling off in economic growth and the major problems for the public finances represented by changes in migration patterns, the outcome at the end of this year will not be all that satisfactory.  In fact, taking everything into account, I think it is a very respectable achievement by the Government and the Department of Finance to have kept the situation so firmly under control that the overrun is of a comparatively lower order than had been anticipated.</P>

      <P>I am asserting to the Deputy that in so far as employment is concerned, it is holding up well and all the indicators confirm that.  However, I do accept and acknowledge that the live register is at an unacceptable level and it has been conclusively proved, again and again, to have been caused in the main by the welcome return of emigrants and the cessation of emigration.  That is something we welcome but, of course, it does present us with budgetary problems and also with the challenge of reducing that live register figure.  I want to again assure the Deputy, and the House, that the Government have at present under very active consideration a number of initiatives designed to make an assault on that unacceptably high level on the unemployment register.  I would also like to add that in regard to the rise in unemployment here, though it is no great consolation to us, this is something similar to what is taking place all over Europe at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, in his capacity as Minister for Finance, if, having regard to the unsatisfactory range of estimates for growth at any one time over the last 12 months and the wide variants to which he has already testified, he would not reconsider the reply of his Minister of State in respect of the mechanisms of measurement available to us? Would he consider it useful to instruct the Minister for Finance he appoints tomorrow to prepare quarterly figures so that this kind of unproductive debate might be set aside?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always felt that there is great room for improvement in the statistics available to us in this country, not just in that regard but in other areas.  In other economies they are able to have very up to date figures on employment and unemployment.  Here we have only an unemployment register which is not very satisfactory because the real picture is more closely given by figures for employment, vacancies and so on.  In a number of areas there is definitely a need for much better or rather more up to date information.</P>
      <P>I do not think that applies to the estimates for growth in the economy.  After all, at budget time the Department settled in the middle band for 2.25 per cent and now it is almost certain that we will finish up with an actual growth rate of 1.25 per cent.  When one bears in mind that we had the Gulf War and its aftereffects, that there was a major economic recession in the UK, a major economic recession in the US and a generally uncertain situation in regard to the international economy, it is not a totally disastrous error of calculation by the Department of Finance.  It shows very well that the basic economy here is sound, that in spite of all those developments during a very difficult year in 1991 we were still able to maintain growth at all.  In fact we were able to maintain growth at 1.25 per cent as against 2.25 per cent projected at budget time.</P>

      <P>Appendix B of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> sets out measures agreed between public service employers and the ICTU which were designed to avoid compulsory redundancy where staff surpluses arise in any particular area of the public service. Those measures include redeployment, early retirement/severance or other agreed measures including career breaks or unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>Those arrangements come into play only where changes give rise to staff surpluses and the decision on the specific measures or mix of measures to be adopted in any such instance will have to be determined by local management in consultation with its workforce and their union representatives having regard to the particular circumstances of their organisation.</P>
      <P>Since these measures have been, in the words of the agreement, &ldquo;designed to avoid compulsory redundancy&rdquo;, it would be unfair to the staff concerned and to the taxpayer if I were to rule out in advance any one of the alternative solutions which have been identified.</P>

Any satisfactory outcome at the Maastricht European Council will have to include a strengthening of the present Treaty articles on cohesion.  This is essential if a framework is to be provided within which the Community can develop the instruments necessary to secure adequate progress in this area.  Political commitments designed to underpin this framework will <Col N="1015" /> also be essential.  I would add that, while expenditure instruments, for example, the existing Structural Funds, are one aspect of cohesion, other instruments relating to the revenue side, of the Community budget and to the formulation and implementation of common policies and actions are also of importance.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I should like to make the general point that the Luxembourg draft Treaty on the union, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas last July, reflected the position after six months work in the Inter-Governmental Conferences on economic and monetary union and on political union.  Following further discussion under the auspices of the Dutch Presidency, a revised treaty proposal on economic and monetary union has now been produced and this is now the working document for the Inter-Governmental Conference on this topic.</P>
    <P>As is clear from that document, economic and monetary union will create new areas of competence for the Community. In addition, a new institution, the European Central Bank, will be created to manage a single currency and a single monetary policy.  It follows, therefore, that the existing institutional balance will have to be examined in the context of the changed circumstances which will be brought about by full economic and monetary union.  Of course, this is a matter which is also being given detailed consideration by the Political Union Conference.</P>
    <P>With regard to the European Parliament and economic and monetary union, the Luxembourg draft treaty proposed that Parliament should have a particular role in relation to the democratic accountability of the European Central Bank and that it should have a consultative role in the decision to advance to Stage III of economic and monetary union.  The recent Dutch Presidency draft treaty suggests other areas where Parliament might reasonably have some involvement, for example, in relation to the rules necessary for the co-ordination of economic policies within the Community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> While no final agreement has yet been reached on these proposals, discussions within the Conference on Economic and Monetary Union would indicate that there is a genuine appreciation of the need to provide Parliament with a relevant role in this area.</P>
    <P>Concerning the publication of a White Paper, the Government have indicated that, prior to any referendum which may be necessary following the completion of the Inter-Governmental Conferences, a White Paper will be published which will cover all aspects of the proposed changes in the treaties.</P>
    <P>I think Ireland's general position on economic and monetary union is quite well known at this stage and does not require too much reiteration.  We strongly favour this advance towards closer integration within the Community and, while appreciative of the benefits which may accrue from our participation in that union, we are also concerned to ensure that those benefits are distributed in an equitable manner.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the specific issue raised by Deputy Flanagan, the current draft treaty envisages that the European system of central banks will be established shortly before the move to the final stage of economic and monetary union and that it will take upon itself the full exercise of its powers from the first day of that stage. The beginning of the final stage of economic and monetary union will also see the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates which is designed to lead, without undue delay, to a single currency.  The treaty will not include a date for the final stage since the move to that stage will be contingent upon a number of developments with the Community.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's detailed reply, may I ask him if he would like to comment on the question of a derogation, a subject we are hearing quite a bit about at present in relation to the overall position of monetary union which would have an adverse and terrible effect in the Border area, and on how he sees this question fitting in with the policy <Col N="1017" /> on cohesion with regard to monetary union?</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the provisions in the Dutch draft which would allow the British to opt out of moving to Stage III if their parliament do not want to go ahead? Does he consider that would have adverse implications for Ireland?  Does the Taoiseach agree with the provision in the Dutch draft which would require a country moving on to Stage III to have a debt-GDP ratio which did not exceed 60 per cent in view of the fact that ours is now around 97 per cent?  Finally, does the Taoiseach agree with the provisions in the Dutch draft in regard to penalties for countries which subsequently have what the council regards as excessive budget deficits?</P>

      <P>There are still only drafts and are the basis of intensive ongoing negotiation.  I do not wish to go any further than I have already gone by way of a comprehensive statement to the House quite recently.  We are very much aware, for instance, that matters like the 60 per cent debt-GDP ratio would require major efforts on our part to comply with it.  However, we are determined to do that; we are also strongly negotiating on matters of that kind and of course the area of penalties is also one which we are negotiating very strenuously because, in a way, it is anomalous to say the least, to say to a member state which is in difficulties that they have to be penalised, thereby adding to their difficulties.  Commonsense would accept the reasonableness of that argument.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree with the estimate that the Irish economy would have to grow by something like 2 per cent each year for the next 20 years above the average growth rate of the European Community in order to achieve convergence with the rest of the Community?  If so, what instrument does he see being put in place as a result of the new treaty to achieve that kind of growth and convergence?  Is the Taoiseach aware &mdash; I am sure he is &mdash; that the European Parliament is of the view that there is a requirement for a coherent common industrial policy by the European Community which is, essentially, an interventionist position?  Do the Irish Government agree with that and, if so, will they support the inclusion of a reference to a common industrial policy in the new treaty amendments which are being negotiated at present?</P>

It is one of the things we have specifically advocated and which we are determined to have included.  That is the sensible approach for a country like ours. I would not accept the forecast by the Deputy as it is not very sensible to forecast 20 years ahead.</P>

I should not like to give any decision on the question raised by Deputy Bruton in that regard except to say that it is my wish and my hope &mdash; as a small member state with everything to gain from integration &mdash; that Maastricht will be successful overall.

It is, undoubtedly, in the best interest of a small country like ours to be part of an integrated Europe with a single market and moving towards full economic and monetary integration.  We must ensure in the negotiations that enshrined in that process, as an integral part of it, is the principle of economic and social cohesion.  In that way we can ensure that peripheral regions of the Community, like ours, away from the prosperous centre, will benefit fully in the economic expansion which the integrated economic and monetary union will bring.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Justice what steps he intends taking to investigate the allegations of illegal surveillance and illegal telephone tapping made by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and other Members of this House, at the Fianna Fáil meeting in Leinster House on Saturday, 9 November 1991; if he will assure the House that neither the alleged surveillance nor the alleged telephone tapping was carried out on his instructions or on the instructions of anybody reporting to him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the meeting of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party concerns were expressed by two Deputies who believed that their telephones were illegally tapped.  They emphasised that they did not believe the Garda were <Col N="1021" /> involved.  On the basis of these allegations I asked the Garda authorities to carry out an investigation.  This investigation, which was carried out and completed yesterday involved a visit to the Deputies homes by relevant Garda personnel for the purpose of carrying out an electronic sweep, and Telecom engineers checked and cleared the local telephone exchanges.  A similar examination was carried out in the Leinster House office of one of the Deputies who was concerned that his office phone may have been illegally tapped.  The result of these examinations showed that there was no interference with the telephones of the Deputies concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to the allegations made by Deputy Reynolds, he indicated at the meeting last Saturday that he felt he was the subject of unauthorised surveillance, but again no allegation was made about the Garda.  Deputy Reynolds indicated that his concern arose from the presence of a white van acting suspiciously in the vicinity of his home.  This allegation has also been brought to the attention of the Garda authorities and is now the subject of a Garda investigation.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear in response to the specific questions posed by the Deputy, that I very much resent the imputation contained in the Deputy's question that I, as Minister for Justice, would have had hand, act or part in illegal telephone tapping or illegal surveillance. It may not have been the intention of the Deputy to make any such imputation, and I am sure that on reflection he will wish to take the opportunity now to withdraw the suggestion that either I or anybody reporting to me gave instructions that the law was to be flouted.  The allegations regarding illegal telephone tapping have been investigated and it has been found that no such thing happened. There is a duty on all sides of this House to act in a reasonable manner and not to add further to public disquiet.</P>

Second, I have asked the Minister not about illegal telephone tapping but whether he was responsible for legal telephone tapping. I accept the assurances he was given to the House that there is no warrant in existence on the telephone of any Member of this House.  Finally, I would like to ask if, in assuring the House that the Garda discovered no interference with the telephones of Deputy Dempsey or Deputy Ellis, he is saying that no interference was discovered since Saturday when the investigation took place or did the Garda inquiry extend to the period before last Saturday to establish if surveillance had taken place in the period preceding the Fianna Fáil meeting?  If the investigation has not extended that far, would the Minister ask the Garda to extend it and then report to the House on that matter together with the allegations made by Deputy Reynolds that his house was under surveillance by a white Hiace van?</P>

A full electronic sweep has been carried out not only of the phones but of the homes concerned and the Telecom engineers have also carried out their work on the telephone exchange to make sure that was clear.  The result is that no such tapping took place.  In relation to the final part of the Deputy's question, that is a matter for investigation by the Garda.

    <Title>Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990   [Seanad]:  Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment of the debate on this important legislation I pointed out that a toxic waste disposal unit could have been set up here ten years ago but was not. Nobody knows where some of the toxic <Col N="1144" /> waste has been disposed of in the intervening period because there has been no method of monitoring, no law governing the disposal of toxic waste and, much more important, we have not given those who produce toxic waste a facility whereby it can be disposed of legally and visibly so that we can be sure it does not get into the ground, streams or rivers.</P>
      <P>At the moment, for several reasons, the matter of environmental protection, with which this Bill deals, is assuming a very high priority in people's consciousness. The Bill seeks to establish the Environmental Protection Agency.  The whole question of the disposal of waste and the protection of the environment is not only engaging the attention of county councils, urban councils and town commissioners but that of the public who are extremely concerned about what is happening.</P>
      <P>In the past 12 months much attention has been given to a landfill site on the south side of Cork city that has been used for perhaps 20 years as a landfill site for the city.  Much of the land that has been filled has been reclaimed and been built on.  Sports fields have been provided on the site and it is proposed to build new homes on it.  Indeed, a new road has been put through it.  The landfill site is now in its final years.  There was considerable agitation by the people living in the vicinity of the site.  It was raised in the June local government elections and had been an issue with the council before.  A member of the corporation tabled a motion, which was passed, recommending that the site be closed within five years.  Local residents, and, indeed, the people of Cork city, were pleased with that decision.  However, the motion stopped short of suggesting an alternative method to dispose of the many thousands of tonnes of waste that would be produced in Cork city after that.  The problem can be solved.  The corporation own the land which is now being filled.  It is inside the city boundary, which is tightly drawn, and the cost of disposing of waste there is reasonable.  I do not wish to exaggerate that; it is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the cost of transport of <Col N="1145" /> waste, the procurement of a site, the application for planning permission and the agitation that would follow from moving to another site is something the corporation could not afford.  It is obvious that the Government will have to pick up the tab for that.  I know that the former Minister for the Environment was approached on several occasions in the past few years to provide funds necessary to establish another waste disposal facility.  That will have to be provided if the corporation's motion to close the landfill site within five years is to be adhered to.</P>
    <P>The management of the site is reasonably good.  Problems have been experienced with smells, seagulls and rodents, but the corporation pay an amount of attention to its management.  To have a landfill site on one's doorstep is not pleasant.  If I were asked whether I would permit a new landfill site in my backyard I would certainly say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I understand the concern of the people who live there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy have the toxic dump instead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is serious in that question; she is probably trying to get her own back for remarks I made previously about the provision of a toxic waste disposal facility which I had arranged.  I do not want to go over those arguments again.  The Minister and Deputy Taylor presented themselves as the great guardians of the environment, and they took personal responsibility to ensure that the waste disposal facility went anywhere other than in their backyard. If the Minister does not face up to her responsibilities in the education of the public then people will continually follow her example and refuse to have the facility in their own backyard.  The Minister will not be able to blame them for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are problems of disposal of ordinary domestic waste and of toxic waste disposal.  It will cost a large amount of money to do that but if we do not face <Col N="1146" /> up to the costs involved we will continually face agitation and a danger to the environment by people illegally dumping waste.  The illegal dumping of waste is one of the biggest problems because the Government have not provided legal dumping facilities.  There has been considerable concern expressed &mdash; and it is ironic that Deputy Dukes made the point earlier in this debate &mdash; and we call constantly for the closure of Sellafield.  At the same time because we do not provide a toxic waste disposal facility here we export toxic waste to Sellafield to have them dispose of it there even though, out of the other side of our mouths, we call for the closure of that plant.  The Government have a huge responsibility to face up to this.</P>
    <P>When the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, first spoke about the establishment of a toxic waste facility here he said that, of course, there would be no importation of waste into this country to be disposed of by our disposal facility.  Nonetheless he had no problem at all about sending our waste to another jurisdiction.  I am not sure &mdash; and perhaps the Minister of State would enlighten me on this point &mdash; whether the former Minister had entered into discussions with the Du Pont people in the North to establish a toxic waste disposal facility in their area.</P>
    <P>To my mind, European law that stipulates that every country should have a toxic waste disposal facility, is daft in that the sheer size of such facility would be far too large for, say, Luxembourg, probably for this country, Portugal and perhaps others.  Therefore, European law does not make sense.  Evidently the thinking behind that law is that it is desirable that toxic waste would not be transported over great distances.  That is nonsense as well because to transport toxic waste from, say, the north of Scotland down to the south of England is a far greater distance than would be involved in its transportation from, say, Dublin to Derry.  If we are to have a toxic waste disposal facility, one for this entire island would be sufficient.  I am not technically qualified to say what would <Col N="1147" /> be the correct size but I imagine one such facility would be sufficient for this country, North and South.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the Minister in particular and the Government to engage in an educational process, choosing the most suitable site involving the minimum transportation of toxic waste on this island.  They should take their courage in their hands, finance it, have it established as quickly as possible and thereby eliminate this scandal of toxic waste being dumped by irresponsible people at points all over the country. That is the greatest scandal.  Because such toxic waste disposal facility has not been established such practices are continuing. I am certain that 90 per cent of the producers and disposers of toxic waste are honest people and dump in a conscientious manner.  But the remaining 10 per cent are not responsible.  The Minister should be concerned to ensure that whatever they produce is brought to a proper waste disposal facility.</P>
    <P>I have a document here entitled Environmental Notes for Parliamentarians issued under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme with the support of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in which it is said:</P>
    <P>Commission funding worth £16 million ECUs is to be allocated for an operational programme aimed at environmental pollution control in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The European Regional Development Fund (European Regional Development Fund) will finance the Community's contribution to the programme which has a total of 24 million ECUs and falls within the framework of the Community's ENVIREG initiative. The main objectives of the ENVIREG initiative are to reduce pollution in the Community's less-developed regions, especially outlying coastal areas, improve the management and co-ordination of hazardous and toxic waste and the development of land use in coastal areas to preserve the natural environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> Evidently the Northern Ireland authorities received 16 million ECUs out of a total fund of 24 million ECUs, a very generous contribution, presumably on the basis of a programme presented to the European Commission.  I should be grateful if the Minister would inform the House whether we have submitted such a programme to the Commission and whether it is funded.  If it is funded perhaps the Minister would tell us whether it is funded by way of a joint submission from Northern Ireland and Dublin to the Commission for funding for the facility for toxic waste disposal.  Perhaps the Minister would also inform us whether there is funding for the land in Cork, about which I spoke earlier, whether the dump there is to be closed in five years and moved to another area and whether funds will be got from the European Regional Development Fund under the programme for pollution control.  If the people in Cork could see that funding was coming from that source the idea of closing the dump would carry more credibility.  It does not carry much credibility at present because people perceive it to have been more or less a political stroke, with one eye on the local elections, rather than concern for the environment in which they live.  If the Minister could make an announcement saying: yes, there is money available under this programme from the European Commission, a portion of which will be sent to Cork Corporation so that they can begin to plan for the provision of a new site when the present one closes, that would certainly help.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is in regard to the Environmental Protection Agency itself.  The Minister will be aware that there were charges made recently in Cork <i>vis-á-vis</i> people's concerns and objections in regard to chemical industries, in particular in the harbour area. Indeed the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to this when he was in Cork approximately two months ago, as have the IDA and Cork County Council. With the very high level of unemployment in Cork the establishment of high quality employment plants is <Col N="1149" /> needed.  Next year the Sandoz plant will be opening there.  After more than two years they have not yet found their way through the labyrinth of objections to their proposals.  Their submissions have been taken as far as the Supreme Court with regard to emissions into the air under the licence granted by Cork County Council.  In the final analysis I am sure the establishment of that plant will take place.  If any other prospective employer were to come to Cork and discover that it took Sandoz nearly three years to complete their planning they would not be enthused about establishing a plant in the Cork region.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled in the past month the former Minister admitted that the IDA had told him there were two occasions when prospective employers &mdash; because of the planning problems experienced in the Cork region &mdash; had decided not to continue their interest in the region.  I do not know who those people were but that is very disturbing news.  As against that, one cannot take away people's rights to protect their environment and to have recourse to the laws to do so.</P>
    <P>We must devise in this House &mdash; and here the responsibility rests with the Government &mdash; a comprehensive planning structure so that people will know precisely how long such planning will take.  Of course that applies only to industrialists coming here.  We must devise some new law <i>vis-à-vis</i> planning that will stipulate a final date within which a planning application must be completed.  That would mean that an industrialist from any part of the world hoping to establish a chemical plant in the Cork region, which is where the problem lies, would know the precise duration of the term within which their application would be dealt with.  Of course that should be as short a time as possible, whether six months, two months for the original planning application, two months for an appeal, or whatever, so that they would be aware there was a specified final date.  They should know there is finality and that they will not be taken from court to court, incurring considerable expense.  Sandoz <Col N="1150" /> took the risk and went ahead but two other companies went elsewhere.  I am not advocating that dirty industries should be welcomed or claiming that we do not need laws to protect the environment. I am saying that there should be some finality in the planning process so that the possibility of being dragged through the courts does not have the effect of industries turning away.</P>
    <P>I make the point politically that when the Bill is passed the agency should be established in Cork.  That is the area I represent and I want jobs to be created there.  I would not mind being accused of looking for jobs in my constituency. There is, however, another compelling reason for the establishment of the agency in Cork.  The problems regarding chemical industries and the need for environmental protection have a higher profile in the Cork Harbour region than anywhere else.  No other location has so many industries of this type and no other local authority has more expertise in environmental protection than Cork County Council.  They have more expertise than any other county council in the control of the environment.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister when replying will state that the agency will be immediately established, staffed and located following the passage of the legislation.  I am advocating Cork as the location not because it is the city I am from but because that is where the problem is most keenly perceived and where the expertise exists to deal with the problem.  The Environmental Protection Agency must be established in Cork.  That is the only logical thing to do.  I am not pleading with the Minister; it should be there anyway.</P>
    <P>Can anything be done about the blight on the environment from Malin Head to Mizen Head caused by ESB and telephone poles which are dotted across the countryside?  If one drives from Castle-townbere to Allihies one sees lines of wooden poles with loops of wire.  If the Government want to engage in employment creation outside the Dublin area they can undertake a programme, extending perhaps over ten years, to <Col N="1151" /> place these wires and cables underground. I would be reasonably confident that funds would be available from Europe.  Rural employment could be increased quite considerably and the visual impact of the countryside would be immeasurably improved.  The irony is that the small farmers have had to pay for the erection of these ugly poles.  Anyone dealing with rural electrification knows that people were asked to pay perhaps £1,200 or £1,500 per pole to get electricity brought half a mile to their dwelling.  The Taoiseach is only paying £15,000 to have windmills installed on his island.  No wonder the people are cynical.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about MMDS masts.  I believe the concerns expressed have been very much exaggerated in regard to the levels of radiation emitted by MMDS masts.  Of course, it does not matter what I believe.  People believe there is a danger of contracting cancer from proximity to MMDS masts. Assurances in this regard from people who have knowledge and expertise in this area would help to alleviate such fears.  Concern has been expressed in Galway and in Cork about the radiation dangers.  It is a concern I do not share.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with considerable pleasure that I welcome this legislation. This Bill shows the firm commitment of the Minister of State to stamp her ideas on the Department of the Environment. It is futuristic legislation in that it endeavours to provide protection across many different areas of the natural environment. It is a definite step forward.  The Minister has shown her commitment in the legislation regarding clean air for Dublin, which has proved an outstanding success.  Anyone who has lived through the last few years of polluted air in Dublin will realise that what seemed impossible to achieve was done in one fell swoop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delicate environment in which we live and which we treasure must be protected by imaginative legislation, not only setting up agencies of this kind but providing for decisive action when necessary. As time goes on we will need <Col N="1152" /> imaginative ideas and brave moves.  So many interacting forces stand in the way of making moves towards a better environment that there is a conflict between progress and protection.  There is great pressure from multinational companies who are siting welcome industries here and creating jobs, but this must never be at a price to the delicate environment of which we are temporary custodians.  It is all very fine to speak in terms of punitive fines and terms of imprisonment for transgressions of the law relating to the environment.  Perhaps before she replies the Minister will examine the possibility of making studies of the environment part of the school curriculum.  The protection of our environment has become so urgent it deserves to be made a State examination subject.  It should be introduced at junior certificate level and, if possible, made part of the curriculum during children's formative years.  Our environment depends on the development of an educated attitude.</P>
    <P>At present we can see on our television screens the horrendous war in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia.  In the past many Irish people had very enjoyable holidays in that country and saw the beautiful city of Dubrovnik in all its splendour.  That city is now being turned into rubble.  Only last year we saw burning oil wells in Kuwait causing horrendous damage to the environment.  We also saw the disastrous oil slick off the coast of Alaska. Television has made the world smaller and brought the issue of protecting our natural environment into our homes.  It is a matter of urgency that we educate our children on this issue and the only way we can do this is by formalising our attitude towards the environment and not merely depending on its being made a branch of engineering, physics or some other subject of that nature.  It has to be made a subject in its own right. Students who undertake studies of our environment should be rewarded at examination time.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of environmental pollution &mdash; water pollution, noise pollution, air pollution, recycling of waste, etc.  The Department of Education <Col N="1153" /> have at their disposal the necessary infrastructure to introduce a syllabus including this subject, in second level schools; this subject is tackled to some extent in civics at primary level.  However, when students enter second level education they understandably become obsessed about getting on by pursuing courses in the humanities, physics etc.  Scant regard is paid by schools to what I would regard as the most important subject of all, the protection of the delicate ecological balance of this planet.  Because no recognition is given to this subject, students are not as worried about it as they should be.  We have a duty to give young people the opportunity to study this subject.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, has the imagination and initiative to see that this issue is carried through to the classrooms.  It could also be made a degree course in third level institutions.  This would ensure that the development studies carried out by students throughout Europe would lead to greater international co-operation. While we pay lip service to the fact that pollution is a trans-global problem and that burning bituminous coal at Money-point transports acid rain to areas in Scandinavia and Iceland, it is a shame that we do not attach enough importance to this issue from an educational point of view.</P>
    <P>For the past ten years or so we have been screaming for the closure of the nuclear waste bin, as I call it, on our doorstep, Sellafield.  I am convinced the reason we have not made progress in this area is that Irish nuclear authorities depend on the British authorities for much of their information.  We do not have enough expertise on nuclear issues to cope with these multinational companies. People here have not been properly educated to enable them to cope adequately with overseas so-called experts who are putting this country at risk by keeping Sellafield open.  The education of students on the need to protect our environment is the key to the future.</P>
    <P>I recently visited Uganda.  It is a strange irony that Third World countries do not abuse the natural environment to <Col N="1154" /> the same extent as developed western countries.  For example, the people there do not discard plastic bottles, wood or metal for the simple reason that what matters most to them is tomorrow's breakfast.  The amount of waste in Ireland, England and, to a more vulgar extent, America is so great it is an embarrassment. We can learn a lot from Third World countries on how to use many of the items we dispose of.  Our attitude to waste is shameful.</P>
    <P>I do not think it has been recognised that the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, set in train pilot schemes for the recycling of waste.  However, many of these schemes which were operated in certain areas of Dublin have been halted all of a sudden.  Young people took to these schemes very well.  As I said earlier, the effects of the legislation introduced by the Minister to combat the smog problem in Dublin can be seen by everybody. Yet a halt has been called to the schemes for the recycling of waste.  The Minister should take up this initiative again.  I know the citizens of Dublin would cooperate with her making such schemes work.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of waste management.  As I said earlier, we can learn much from Third World countries. In western developed societies we look back to history, to the founders of our nation, how they struggled to build our country and we look back to prehistoric times and see how people struggled to survive.  We also have our present and we plan for our future.  We plan where we will be in ten to 15 years' time, we look onwards, we take out insurance policies, we think of pensions, but we do not think so much about our environment and how it will be in the future.  In Third World countries they have their past, they certainly have their present but they do not have the same attitude towards the future.  They have what they call an extended presence and their concern is for tomorrow's breakfast, their foodstuff and their survival.  Yet, with all the education and the wealth at our disposal, we are not thinking about how the planet will survive; we are not doing <Col N="1155" /> anything positive about it.  We hear facts and figures about global warming, about ripping asunder rain forests. Perhaps today somewhere in the world an entire geographical area the size of Munster has been stripped of it trees. These are horrendous practices.  It is not until the planet warms by a degree or two that we react.  Why?  It is because we do not have the educational input or concern; we think in a selfish manner how we will be as far as our material wealth is concerned in 20 or 30 years. We have scant regard for future generations, scant regard for children who will have to take the planet in whatever way they will find it.  We are guilty in that respect.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity on this island to demand from countries with money that they look upon Ireland as a country that could be earmarked for environmental protection.  It would not take an enormous sum of money to put Ireland forward as an example for Europe of a pollution free country.  One would not be talking about an enormous cost in the budgets of Germany, France or the very wealthy countries in Europe. We should demand EC funding for many of our projects. We should demand for our environment protection from Europe because it is the pollution-free market garden for good growing and foodstuffs.  We have to tackle environmental protection on many different fronts.</P>
    <P>I referred to the question of the educational input in schools and I urge the Minister to do something about it.  A formalised approach would be where my son or anyone's son or daughter can sit the junior certificate or leaving certificate and gain an A in environmental studies which would give them as much qualification to enter third level education as, say, geography, history, Irish or whatever.</P>
    <P>We should be prepared to take examples of environmental pollution directly to the European court. The striking example is Sellafield.  There has been much discussion about Sellafield, whether we would succeed in the European court if we were to take British Nuclear Fuels to law on this issue.  I firmly <Col N="1156" /> believe we should make a point of doing that; we will not know unless we try. We will spend enormous sums of money on other forms of litigation.  The world would look to Ireland in that respect and there would be an enormous international focus on exactly what we were trying to do.  Perhaps we would contain in some way what seems to me the unbridled expansion of the THORP plant and the underground storage of waste disposal there.  Rather than going over the litany of statistics that condemn British Nuclear Fuels for the inaccurate information they have cynically fed out over the years, it would focus attention on the future because this is a money-making industry which is a potential timebomb on our doorsteps.  We do not want another Chernobyl to prove that we should have done something about that. It behoves this nation to take British Nuclear Fuels to the European court on that singular issue and to go as hard as we possibly can on it.</P>
    <P>In relation to any offensive environmental destruction, we can fingerpoint nations that destroy rain forests as well. In the context of this type of Environmental Protection Agency Bill, I do not think it is the Minister's intention that legislation of this kind would have a narrow national significance only because the environment does not have that national significance only: it has an immense international significance.  If there are areas such as nuclear radiation or the destruction of rain forests, why not embody in that legislation ways and means of getting international courts and fingerpointing nations that are causing offence of this kind.  Unless we, like the so-called developed western nations, engage in aggressive action of that kind, as soon as Third World countries begin to get on their feet &mdash; they are not there yet &mdash; and as soon as they want consumer goods which will be thrown at them, and they will be exploited into buying consumer goods they do not need &mdash; environmental pollution will descend on the people who, on the one hand, are trying to protect the environment but, on the other hand, are causing the offence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> As a nation we must be prepared to play our part in breaking the vicious cycle where the multinationals have such a firm grip and control on developing industries. We must stop the shameless destruction of countries that cannot afford to stand up to the multinationals. Nations such as ourselves, through international litigation, without fear or favour, must be prepared to take on these groups.  We can play that part and would gain international respect for so doing. There are ways in which Ireland can play its part and the Minister can broaden her brief beyond our nation by taking on board that idea.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister.  I wish her well with this legislation.  There is much that can be said about it.  It is a major Bill.  I do not wish to express any cynicism about legislation of this kind.  That would be wrong, but we have many examples of legislation of this kind to do with the environment that have fallen on deaf ears, for example, the Litter Bill, 1982, which introduced ways and means of working towards a litter-free environment, particularly in Dublin.  I am afraid that, like much legislation, it was never enforced for one reason or another. That leads me to believe that the key is education.  I am convinced of that. We have to encourage the school children to do the field world.  I cannot hide my bias in this respect.  I would award them more points for that than I would for certain subjects that are more narrowly based.</P>
    <P>The Minister's portfolio offers her a huge opportunity.  I would like to see her succeed in the area of educational input and I appeal to her to take account of that aspect.  I look forward to the Minister's summary and to participating on Committee Stage which will give us greater opportunity to raise particular issues.  I welcome the legislation and wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the previous two speakers one would have to conclude that the debate has been somewhat repetitive. I agree with Deputy Brady and the previous speaker because, generally <Col N="1158" /> speaking, environmental control problems are common.  Local authorities have to deal with environmental control and are often badly equipped to do the job.  The main controlling unit in regard to the environment is the local authority. If they cannot do the job there will be a very big gap in environmental control. Over the last few years local authorities have lost a substantial proportion of outdoor staff and that causes problems for environment control.  The outdoor staff actually work on the environment and local authorities who have shed large percentages of their outdoor staff are facing problems.  The outdoor staff of the local authority sweep the streets, clean the gullies and do all the menial work which is very important in the control of the environment.</P>
      <P>While it is not often that State agencies are complimented, I compliment FÁS who have had a major impact on environmental development in all areas.  They have utilised labour in a positive way. Young and not so young people who had been long term unemployed were paid to do positive work making a major impact on the environment throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Having spent some time in London recently I was pleased to come back to my own town.  The environment in County Louth is way ahead of the environment in many areas of London.  I was appalled at the condition of the environment at the centre of the universe, as far as democracy was concerned.  When I came back to Ireland I felt I was on a different planet.  I had the same experience on returning from Brussels recently. We run down our country and find faults with it but we rarely give credit where it is due.  Generally speaking, the environment here will match the environment in any other country in the world and we are way up the league table as far as the environment generally is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the abuse of the environment here is caused in a number of specific ways.  The pollution is being caused by <Col N="1159" /> many of the people who publicly complain about the environment.  Most of the pollution on the streets in urban areas throughout the country is caused by takeaways and other shops.  Packaging and cans bought in those shops are just thrown on the streets by young and not so young people and, particularly over the weekend, towns are faced with huge litter problems.  Incorporated in any regulations which the Minister might draw up under this Bill should be a solution to this litter problem.  The takeaways should be controlled as to their opening hours and their numbers.  Guidelines should be set down to control that area and such shops should have to pay a bigger contribution to local authorities towards the cleaning up operations, particularly at weekends. This is a problem that tourists notice.  A very small proportion of the population cause this huge amount of litter over the weekends.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the outdoor staff of local authorities.  Formerly local authorities could employ people for Saturday evenings or Sunday mornings to carry out cleaning up operations.  Some local authorities can still do this but in other local authorities this work has been cut back because of restricted finance.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has introduced this Bill.  All would agree she has made a positive contribution towards solving the problem of our environment. It is significant that the Minister is a woman.  Women can tell us more about environmental control than men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I like to point to the truth. The women of Ireland have to keep the homes.  They do all the donkey work. They keep the house tidy, they keep the garden tidy, they keep the environment around the home tidy and they keep their children tidy.  It stands to reason that they <Col N="1160" /> know more about tidiness and environmental control than their opposite numbers, the men of the world, who mostly go out at night eating bags of chips and throwing the boxes all over the street.  I suppose a few women would do that too but, from what I can see, the main villains of the peace late at night are men.</P>
      <P>The local authorities have generally welcomed the Bill.  However, many of the officials that I spoke to about it say that, as in the case of other Bills where the local authorities have to play a major part in putting them into effect, they can only do so if they are given the finance, the back-up to carry out the work that will be necessary under the provisions of the Bill.  There is no point in putting legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas and handing down regulations to local authorities if they are not given the money to carry out the work. If this happens the Bill will have been a waste of time and a total failure.</P>
      <P>As someone who lives fairly close to Sellafield, whose constituency is probably closer to it than anybody else's, I must add my voice on that subject.  Studies and soil testing carried out in County Louth, particularly in north County Louth and across the Border in County Down, clearly establish that the level of radioactivity in the soil in those two counties on numerous occasions is, has been, and continues to be higher than the national average.  This must be a clear indication that radioactivity is finding its way across the Irish Sea, into our homes, our streets and our air.  There are consistent assurances by the various agencies that this is not harmful.  That is not the picture that is being painted for us in County Louth.  We still have not been able to effectively prove or disprove that Sellafield is not and was not responsible for the very large degree of Down's Syndrome found in children in County Louth particularly in the Dundalk area when there was a leakage from Sellafield. I have been over there on delegations and protests with other Members of this House and other colleagues serving on local authorities on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> We must keep up the pressure and keep saying to the British that we disapprove of Sellafield, that we are fearful for our people and that our people are fearful about its effects.  We must keep saying it at EC level; we must keep saying it until such time as some political grouping in the UK do something about it, perhaps the next government there.  I think there is a better chance that a Labour Government in the UK would do something about it than a Conservative Government and hopefully that will come to pass.</P>
    <P>Recycling has been referred to by virtually every speaker.  There is a somewhat half-hearted approach to that by the Department.  The unit that deals with that could be strengthened, given more teeth and more money.  There are a number of people who are unemployed who would be happy to get involved in this area of recycling at local level.  This can only be done if these people are given the financial incentive to do so.  Many people in my consitituency who wanted to get involved in this activity were discouraged because they did not have enough money.  There were people who have been made redundant and who were prepared to put in a limited amount of their funds if they got the necessary support from the Department.</P>
    <P>This is a very slow process.  It takes an enormous amount of time to get a project off the ground.  The Minister should examine the whole operation of recycling and get reports from the local authorities to see what exactly they have done in encouraging that.  Young people, for example, have met this subject in a very positive way.  Organisations like the Red Cross have been able to make a few pounds for their organisation to spend on the poorer sections of our community by recycling and by becoming more involved in that activity.</P>
    <P>I agree also that the whole question of the environment is one that should be dealt with through our educational system.  It should be a more positive subject in the curriculum and should be set for examination purposes, ranking at <Col N="1162" /> least equally with other subjects in the present curriculum.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of things we should do to improve the environment. The biggest one would be to tackle the whole question of water pollution.  Here again we know the cause of water pollution. I live on the coast in a town built on one of the most famous rivers, the Boyne.  The pollution of the river Boyne is caused by the local authorities depositing huge amounts of sewage into the river itself.  That is not the fault of Drogheda Corporation, of Navan Urban District Council or the local authorities of the towns on the banks of the river Boyne. The cause of the problem has been the length of time it has taken to build a sewage treatment plant.  Naturally we are pleased that Drogheda Corporation have at last been able to find the money, through EC funding, to build the necessary plant, hopefully within the next two or three years.  Plans are well ahead at this stage.  The point is that it would never have been possible to do that without EC funding because treatment plants cost anything from £10 million to £30 million. The only way that can be done is to utilise funding available from the EC which must be matched by funding from whatever Government is in power.</P>
    <P>Pollution from sewage is the biggest source of pollution and the biggest source of danger to the health of the people in this country that I am aware of.  There are many areas of our coast where people cannot swim in the sea.  They certainly cannot swim in our rivers and that situation has developed in my lifetime.  I learned how to swim in the river Boyne and swam there for many years as a young boy.  However, one will not see any young people swimming in the river now and that is because of the raw sewage and other industrial waste that is being dumped into the river.  That river is a typical example of what has happened all over the country.</P>
    <P>The pollution of our lakes, particularly in scenic areas and those with huge tourist potential, has happened simply because of bad planning by local authorities, <Col N="1163" /> because pits are located too close to streams that flow into our lakes and where planning permission has been given without considering the effects of pollution on our reservoirs and lakes.  While we can do a lot to improve our environment further we should not create a false image that we do not care about the environment, that we will continue to pollute our atmosphere, rivers and lakes and are not prepared to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>Residents and tenants' associations all over the country are now availing of whatever financial assistance is available, however limited it may be, from local authorities to make a positive impact on the environment.  I welcome this.  Let me cite what I consider to be the best example.  In one area when the sales of local authority houses increased substantially, the local authority transferred the moneys that were to be used for housing repairs to the heading &ldquo;environmental control&rdquo;.  They offered substantial grants to housing estate committees to purchase equipment and to plant trees, shrubs and plants; in other words, they encouraged people to take care of their own environment within housing estates.  Usually, the visual results were very positive.</P>
    <P>This Bill will give the local authorities teeth but it will only succeed if moneys are provided for the local authorities and the various agencies who will do the work.  In welcoming the Bill I must offer my congratulations to the Minister of State for taking the initiative.  I am sure the Bill will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister of State had to leave as I wanted to welcome her personally to the House while she steers this very important legislation through the House.  I was also hoping to take the opportunity to commend her for introducing the legislation which got rid of smog in Dublin.  That measure has been largely but not entirely successful in that this winter people in the city will be able to breathe more easily and the city's infrastructure will improve as a result. Prior to the introduction of that legislation <Col N="1164" /> many people were sceptical about the possibility of clearing away this smog.  They felt it was useless to ban the sale of bituminous coal when people could continue to light fires.  As a nation we like open fires.  They also drew a parallel with London 25 years ago when the city had been choked by smog.  As far as I can remember, rigid rules were brought in at that time.  People were not allowed to light a fire of any kind. However, there were no smokeless fuels at that time.  I am delighted with the results of the legislation and hope we can go on from here.  I also hope the Minister of State will extend the legislation to cover other cities so that other densely populated areas where there are traditional coal fires will benefit.</P>
      <P>Before Deputy Bell leaves the House I would like to respond to some of the points he made when he spoke about the role of women in relation to environmental protection.  He is quite right when he says that many of the main proponents of environmental protection at both national and international level are women.  I am thinking of such women as Petra Kelly whose voice was one of the first I heard alerting us to what was happening on a global level.  One of the reasons for this is that women produce children &mdash; not entirely on their own &mdash; and are aware of the need for continuity, to ensure that their children are not killed in war or poisoned by the environment and to pass on an environmentally clean world to their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other speakers, I am very relieved that this long anticipated Environmental Protection Agency Bill is before the House at last but despite the best intentions of this House, I hazard a guess that the agency, its advisers and structures will not be a reality for perhaps another year.  I say this with regret rather than to rebuke the Minister of State, as I note from her speech her sense of frustration and even desperation at the tedious and long drawn out incubation period of the Bill.  It is something on which I can sympathise with her because I know what the process of preparing and drafting legislation is like.  It is like a political <Col N="1165" /> iceberg: the important parts of the legislation are hidden from public view and only the tip is seen.  Important legislation, particularly an original Bill in a new policy area, suffers inexplicably from delays in production which should not occur.  I am not suggesting that short cuts should be taken in the process of consultation or research but, if the Bill had been given the priority it deserves, it would have been enacted by now.</P>
    <P>This is substantial legislation comprising 110 sections.  While I have no doubt Members will give the debate due urgency and co-operate in every way, it will have to be scrutinised line by line on Committee and Report Stages.  In the Seanad 416 amendments were tabled, of which 111 were passed.  That is an indication of the interest that will be shown the Bill in this House, which is how it should be.  While the main structures and details of Bills are written elsewhere, the refining, revising and amending by legislators is the vital element and should not be seen as a threat or criticism.  I am heartened by the style and approach adopted by the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, when she dealt with the Bill in the Seanad.  I look forward to an equally good mannered and co-operative debate in this House; the debate so far has been extremely co-operative.</P>
    <P>This is an ambitious Bill and aims to whip our environment into shape between now and the year 2000.  The Minister of State calls it strong medicine. It will be a legal canopy setting up an environmental watch dog to license, monitor, advise, supervise and carry out research.  It will work on an integrated basis, controlling systems for air, water and waste.  The agency will promote good environmental practices and penalise bad ones.  It will establish a labelling scheme for environmentally friendly products and services and set down codes of practice and quality objectives.</P>
    <P>It is a happy litany of aims; who would not want to see them implemented quickly?  Who among us also feels that quick implementation is going to be the order of the day?  I suspect the sad outcome, when it comes to allocating <Col N="1166" /> resources to give the agency teeth, will be questionable, that short cuts will be taken.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will do a fine job in giving the Bill life, but I fear other people in other Departments and places will butcher it. We all know that we are talking about substantial running costs.  One has only to read through the detail of the legislation and what is proposed to know that it will be very costly to finance. Therefore, substantial funds will have to be guaranteed by the Government. Indeed, I had to smile wryly at the final paragraph in the explanatory memorandum regarding the financial implications. It states that as the agency become operational their costs will increasingly be offset by licence fees and charges for services.  I wish them luck but I am not too optimistic.</P>
    <P>Section 10 enables the agency to claim fines imposed by the courts on prosecution. I am not sure whether this is a novel provision, it is certainly an interesting one, under which the agency will have a vested interest in prosecution.  Has consideration been given to whether this will in any way compromise the agency?  Perhaps it will not, perhaps it is a worthwhile measure which will, undoubtedly, guarantee a certain income in the years to come.  I wonder if it has been done anywhere else and what the experience has been of this type of measure.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, the revolution to protect the environment, to get rid of abuses and to reclaim our environment where it has already been abused or killed, is continuing and cannot be reversed.  No other movement of our time has taken hold so dramatically, effectively and broadly, impacting awareness at all levels, local, national, European and international. My earliest recollection of large scale public protest on an environmental issue was the opposition to a proposed nuclear station at Carnsore, County Wexford. Other speakers referred to this.  Indeed many were nostalgic in their recollections of the protest.  At that time my eldest daughter, who was then still in college, spent a very wet muddy weekend camping at the proposed site to protest. She was not the sort to take on radical <Col N="1167" /> politics of any kind.  I was quite surprised when she told me she was part of this campaign and going on the weekend. However, I realised she was part of this young movement which had been so seriously and realistically touched by the likelihood that we would have a nuclear station in the south-east.  They were having none of it, they were uncompromising in their approach to the matter.  We should be thankful to the young activists of that time because their campaign was successful and the plan was dropped.</P>
    <P>One woman who figures in my memory of the environmental debate is Petra Kelly, one of the founders of the German Green Party, one of the early voices warning of the devastation resulting from international policies with regard to nuclear energy, deforestation and the general waste of natural resources.  Hers was a lone voice &mdash; I think I first heard her in 1978 or 1979 &mdash; and she had a compelling message.  I am sure she converted many.  She contributed greatly to the comprehensive environmental controls and the legislation which has been in place for some time in Germany.</P>
    <P>Ireland is coming late in the day to environmental protection.  I do not think we should be congratulating ourselves on a green unspoiled land.  It is more by accident than design and there has been great abuse.  For instance, I saw the decline of Lough Sheelin, County Cavan, 12 years ago because I spent weekends in the area on a regular basis; 12 years ago it was a tranquil spot, a beautiful water landscape which drew crowds for picnics, swimming, boating and fishing.  It would be hard to find a more delightful inland waterway.  Then, over the years, it died, which was very sad; thousands of gallons of farm effluent were dumped irresponsibly and deliberately in the lake. Fish were poisoned, vegetation died and the overall picture was almost like a desert.  Hotels ceased to function, boat hire companies went out of business and it was awful to see how such a beautiful spot, from which people got so much enjoyment, could so easily be turned into <Col N="1168" /> a virtual desert.  However, I believe that some remedial action has been taken, pollution has been reduced and the lake on the way to recovery, which I am very pleased to hear.</P>
    <P>How much of this type of pollution is going on?  Lough Sheelin is a major lake and people could see what was happening but I suspect there are smaller rivers and streams which are similarly polluted by irresponsible dumping.  I wonder how such pollution can be stopped.  Can it be detected earlier or prevented?  Will the best possible measures for detection be part of the Bill?  They are not enshrined in it as it stands.  Recently, while in county Waterford on a walk in the country, I saw a case of deliberate pollution; a small pipe leading from a cattle shed was discharging slurry into what had been a small stream.  The result was that the water was fetid, flowers and bushes were withered and there was a dreadful smell. This was not an accidental leakage of farm effluent, it was a deliberate act of ongoing pollution by a prosperous farmer, although I know that no farmer will admit to being prosperous.  I contacted the local authority involved and was assured that the area would be inspected as I had given the details.  I hope the matter will be resolved.</P>
    <P>Will there be a facility for inspecting farm areas and farmlands by local authority officials under the Bill?  Will the public have to continue being the police force in country areas?  Serious pollution has been caused over the years by the farming community.  Every summer there are fish kills in rivers and lakes, there has been a growth in the use of mechanised farming and an increase in the amount of insecticides and artificial fertilisers in recent years.  The debate on agricultural pollution has very much centred on grant-aid to farmers to try to give them an incentive to care for the environment. I find this quite extraordinary.  I do not understand this thinking.  How can we expect good practice on a long term basis from all involved in productive business if they have to be paid to protect the environment?  Responsible behaviour which protects, preserves and nurtures <Col N="1169" /> our natural environment, must be an intrinsic part of operation in any industry, farming, chemical and energy production.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Dukes, in his contribution touched on a question which also interests me, that of battery disposal. I should like to ask the Minister what the chances are of starting a battery bank such as we have for cans and glass recycling.  We should at least have one for button batteries as I have been told they are very hazardous when dumped. Thousands are discarded every year because they are used in calculators, cameras and dictating machines.  They contain silver and mercury and are a serious hazard if randomly discarded.  One camera distributor told me that there is concern in the industry at what is happening.  People just wantonly throw away these batteries. People in the industry have been asked again and again by their counterparts in Germany and Denmark whether we have a collection programme not only to responsibly dispose of the batteries but also to break down the component parts for reuse.  I would be interested to know if there are any proposals in this regard, what is happening in other European countries and if it is possible that the component parts of batteries, particularly button batteries, can be reused.</P>
    <P>There are many matters that can be raised in this legislation.  The contributions have been very varied, some technical and more informed that others.  When one focuses on the environment one thinks of it in broad terms. Matters such as Chernobyl, the burning wells after the Gulf War, global warming, Brazilian forests, Sellafield and so on are too great to cope with.  All these incidents are happening at a distance and we have no control over them.  However, Ireland and other European countries can introduce co-ordinated legislation, standards and regulations and put in place the kind of educational provisions that Deputy Gerard Brady spoke about.  We would then achieve a uniform respect for the environment and a commitment from people generally to its protection.  Unless <Col N="1170" /> we do that we will end up with a world sadly depleted of natural resources.</P>
    <P>In focusing attention on a Bill as comprehensive as this, we tend to consider our own environment and community. We think of the matters that irritate us and about which something should be done.  Apart from the smog in Dublin the greatest concern to me is the pollution caused by fumes from city buses. Anybody who drives behind buses here must be horrified at the filthy fumes emitted into the atmosphere.  I question whether there is any control over transport pollution, particularly from buses. Something should be done to clean up the buses because they are contributing enormously to pollution.  I hope that in the future environmental impact assessments will be carried out in areas of development, be it industrial development, major factories or even suburban development.</P>
    <P>During my childhood I lived in Dundrum, an area I now represent.  The whole landscape from Dundrum to the mountains, where school children once went for picnics and walks, is now another suburbia and is mostly very badly developed.  Environmental impact assessments are very important in finding out the effects of development and buildings in such areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 76 of what is called eco-labelling.  This is intended to give clear guidance to consumers and enable them to become familiar with quality goods which are environmentally friendly.  This is a very good provision because at present consumers are being exploited as regards labelling, purely for commercial reasons. The provision in this regard is very well drafted and, I believe, will be effective.</P>
    <P>I concur with Deputy Bell's views regarding litter from fast food outlets. This litter is a blight on cities, and something should be done about the matter.  We are always saying here that something should be done but I wonder if there can be some control in this regard so that such a forest of litter is not created.  I wish the Bill well.  I know it is <Col N="1171" /> very much welcomed.  The debate has been very constructive and informative. I look forward to the development of the agency and its success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to begin by emphasising the deep pride that our party feel with the introduction of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill to the Oireachtas by our colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Mary Harney. Deputy Harney has pursued this matter with enormous courage and conviction. She has very rightly earned the respect and admiration of everybody who has spoken here this afternoon and, I have no doubt, of all the people who have spoken on the Bill during its passage through the House so far.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the events of recent weeks, this legislation reflects very well on the political process.  As far back as January 1987 in the policy document, <i>An Ireland Worth Living In,</i> we in the Progressive Democrats sought the establishment of a specialised Environmental Protection Agency.  In the negotiations on the Programme for Government held prior to our entry to Government in 1989 the Progressive Democrats secured a commitment to the establishment of such an agency.  Today we are debating the detailed proposals for this agency which will shortly be established.  This Bill therefore is living proof that politics can work, that policies developed in opposition can be brought forward into Government and that commitments given can be and are honoured.  This of course is a success which is mirrored in many of the areas of the 1989 Programme for Government.  It is in this spirit that we pursued the recent negotiations on a joint programme of action for the next two years.  That programme is now in place and it is with great confidence that I look forward to the implemenation of so many of the aspects of that programme in the lifetime of this Government and beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill thus far has been characterised by an open-minded and inclusive <Col N="1172" /> approach which has been unmatched in recent times.  In advance of the publication of the draft legislation consultations and discussions were held with interested parties throughout the country. That same approach continued in the debate on the Bill in Seanad Éireann where an extraordinary total of 461 amendments were discussed and a total of 111 amendments were agreed.  I have no doubt that the same approach will be adopted in this House leading to consensus on the legislation.  As a result we will have a Bill capable of dealing with the very serious problems of environmental protection not alone in the years ahead but well into the next century, a Bill of which we can all be proud and in which the Minister, Deputy Harney, can take particular pride.</P>
    <P>This legislation is timely.  Ever since our original proposal for such an agency in the early months of 1987, there has been increasing concern for the environment, to the point that it is now one of the top priorities on the political agenda. This rise in public concern has been mirrored, and no doubt encouraged, by the growing threats to the environment from industry, changes in agricultural practices and from bad habits in both urban and rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some might argue that because of the pressing economic problems confronting the country, environmental protection is somewhat of a luxury.  This approach is wrong.  The environment remains this country's greatest and most valuable natural resource but, like all such precious resources, it is finite and has to be preserved and protected, not alone for its own sake but because of the positive impact that a wholesome environment can have on the health of our people, young and old, and on the economic future of the country.  At this point, I wish to join Deputy Fennell in complimenting the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, on the great work she has done in combating the smog problem in Dublin.  I have no doubt that her efforts were a major factor in alleviating the problems experienced by old people in particular in previous years during the <Col N="1173" /> bad months of November, December and January, when the smog hit the city with the same detrimental effect as the Black Plague.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we tend to think of the environment in connection with industry because that is the way the public debate has developed.  However, we should never underestimate the importance of good clean air to the physical as well as the emotional health of our people.  I am encouraged by the progress that has been made to date.</P>
    <P>However, to return to the argument that this emphasis on environmental protection is just a luxury, that approach is far too short-sighted and simplistic. Environmental protection and improvement is more than just an aesthetic discipline to be pursued by those who are sometimes described as the middle classes.  It is of key importance to our long term economic prospects.  It is important to stress that, whether in the area of tourism or of attracting the growing number of clean industries seeking out new areas in which to locate, a clean environment will be a key factor in our future success in those two areas.</P>
    <P>At present we enjoy the reputation of having one of the finest and cleanest environments in Europe.  Our reputation is of great benefit when we seek the very badly needed foreign investment to create the jobs we so critically need at present.  The reality, however, is that we cannot take any great credit for our environment because fortunately we completely escaped the industrial revolution and the consequent industrial development of the late 18th and 19th centuries which so scarred the face of our neighbouring country.  We can be grateful that we escaped it but we certainly cannot be complacent because our environment is a result of an accident of economic history. I will not dwell further on this point.</P>
    <P>We have no grounds for being complacent about the environment.  In Cork more than in any other county, we have had bitter experience of the damage that can be done to the environment by the introduction of new industries which <Col N="1174" /> were put in place without proper provision being made from the start to ensure that those industries did not impact adversely on the environment.  The bitter and divisive controversy which has raged in Cork in relation to the local harbour has been a lesson to all of us.  I hope at this stage that the lesson has been well and truly learned, and no other area will have to be subject to the same degree of legitimate concern and resulting controversy to which the Cork region has been subjected.  We have now emerged from that controversy.  The very justifiable fears of even the most fastidious environmentalists have now been allayed.  If they have not been allayed to date the provisions of the Bill should do so.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State will bring the same degree of energy, vigour and commitment to implementing the provisions of this Bill as she brought to its introduction in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have no doubt that all the fears of environmental groups in the Cork area will be laid to rest and that prospective industries will not be called upon to pay the price for careless and dirty industries of the past.  I hope new industries will not be penalised because of the bad practices of the past. We can now proceed in a proper manner to attract more industry to the Cork region, safe and secure in the knowledge that the highest environmental standards will apply from the start and that all industries will be monitored regularly to ensure that there is no lapse.  We can now enter a happier phase of development around Cork harbour.  That is my realistic hope because I have been fully reassured that proper provision has been made in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is my wish that in future we will not see objections to planning developments not based on facts but stemming from unfounded and unthought out fears.  Such objections are very damaging to industries with a good track record.  Most fairminded people were very taken aback recently by objections to the proposed extension of the Scherring Plough factory in Brinny, near Bandon, County Cork. That company since their inception had <Col N="1175" /> set the highest standards for themselves and maintained them.  They had an extraordinarily good track record.  However, they were the target of unfair and unfounded objections.  I am glad the objections were withdrawn finally and I hope we have seen the end of such objection.  Of course, we welcome objections founded on fact but objections founded on fears or something intangible can only be destructive and detrimental in the long term.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the proposed Enviromental Protection Agency. Sufficient funding should be made available to give teeth to this legislation so that it will be effective from the start.  There is little point in having good legislation on the Statute Book unless it is enforced fully from the beginning.  A key element in ensuring that the aims and objectives of the Bill will be met is that proper funding is made available from the start. In that respect I have no doubt that the Minister, Deputy Harney, will battle long and hard, and successfully I hope, to ensure that that degree of funding is made available.  If the funding is not made available we will have the highest aspirations but not the kind of Bill envisaged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The question relating to personnel is equally important.  I believe that the degree of transparency and openness that the Minister intends for the new agency will go a long way towards ensuring confidence in the agency and trust in its objectivity and fairness.  Inevitably, however, the reputation of the new body will rest greatly on the calibre of the people charged with its operation.  I take great heart from the fact that from the outset the agency will be independent of Government, local authorities and other vested interests.  That is a key element in ensuring the success of the agency. Certainly the method of appointment of the director-general and the other full-time directors through an independent selection committee is one that is to be welcomed and is a very good and strong provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> I should like to speak about the location of the agency.  A previous Cork speaker, Deputy Barry, pleaded with the Minister that the agency be located in Cork.  All I can say is that I support that plea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe we shall get a Minister as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>If we do, all the better.  If we get a Minister for the Environment perhaps it would be better again.  Nonetheless, in the context of this Bill and irrespective of what happens in other arenas, I again plead with the Minister to give full consideration to the benefits of locating the Environmental Protection Agency in Cork.  Because of the recent history of Cork, because of the degree of environmental awareness that now exists in the city and the county, because of the large number of chemical industries &mdash; very sensitive industries &mdash; located in the area, because of the proximity of University College Cork with its capacity to research these matters, and because of what is now a very good environmental group within Cork County Council, the very efficient and effective members of Cork County Council who deal with environmental matters, Cork is very well placed to act as the ideal location for the agency.  If it were to be located in Cork we could take fresh hope in its effectiveness.</P>
      <P>The environment is the sum total of a great many more things than the conflict between industry and environmental awareness groups that I have just described.  The issue is much broader than that.  The Bill is most comprehensive, encompassing all of the issues involved with the environment. There is no doubt that in many places and in many areas we are most careless about our environment.  We are either unconscious or uncaring of the damage we do every day in several small ways &mdash; small ways that add up to a very big blemish on our environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Litter on the streets, particularly on our city streets, is one such manifestation. When travelling through the <Col N="1177" /> country this summer during my holidays I was strongly struck by the way small towns and villages are kept and maintained. I was impressed by their beauty and by the enormous effort that is put in by local communities to plant flowers, window boxes and hanging baskets, to improve shop fronts and shop front signs and generally to upgrade and beautify their environment.  I noticed that a major improvement had taken place in rural Ireland, in the villages and towns, during the past ten years.  Sadly, that is not so in some of the suburbs of our cities.  I do not know the reason but what is happening and the careless manner in which litter is strewn all over suburbs in the cities is a national scandal.</P>
    <P>It points perhaps to a great lack in our education system &mdash; and there I use education in its broadest sense &mdash; that we are so careless of our environment, that somehow we believe it is the corporation's business to clean up the streets.  But what about those who dirty and despoil the streets?  Do they feel in any way that it is their street, their estate, their suburb, their city or their country? They do not seem to, but they must. I agree with Deputy Brady who spoke earlier in the debate that there is great scope for an enhanced educational approach to be taken in relation to our environment.</P>
    <P>Our environment is the most precious thing we have and I believe it will be an even more important issue in the years ahead.  Our environment says something about our self-respect &mdash; it is a very public statement about ourselves, about our standards and our self-respect.  If we cannot maintain our streets and keep them litter-free, if we cannot keep our beaches bottle-free, can-free, litter-free and disposable nappy-free, then there is something fundamentally wrong with us, something that will have to be righted very quickly.</P>
    <P>It will take somebody with the charisma of Minister Harney to reach out to the people and put before them a vision of a better Ireland, a cleaner Ireland, a more attractive Ireland, an Ireland of which the young and old <Col N="1178" /> can be proud.  The environment could be a major unifying force and rallying point in the country at the moment.  We could all, young and old, come together as a people acting in our own communities, with every community doing its bit to try to improve the environment and make our streets, towns and cities cleaner and more attractive places in which to live, work, grow up and grow old.  That could be done, but I think it will happen only if we have the kind of leadership of which the Minister is capable.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister all the luck in the world in getting the Bill passed, in getting its provisions put in place and in getting the agency up and running.  I think it was Deputy Bell who said it was fortuitous that it is a woman who is attempting to do all this and on the scale on which it is now being attempted.  I think that is true, too.  The country now needs a woman's hand, a hand that would act for the benefit of the country, and those benefits would be visible in a very short time. Several things have to be done, however, and the old attitudes simply will not take us through the remainder of this century or into the next.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to speak about Cork.  We talk about our fine harbour &mdash; it is one of the finest harbours in the world &mdash; but is it not a scandal that we still release raw sewage into the waters of Cork harbour? Is it not a scandal, when children want to swim in the sea that in certain winds raw sewage drifts onto the beach?  Is it not true that a proper sewage treatment plant will have to be provided sooner rather than later?  I ask the Minister, even though this is not, strictly speaking, her Department, to use her influence to ensure that proper financial provision is made to enable that to happen.  The argument for clean air in Cork harbour has almost been won, I think, but the battle for clean water has yet to begin.  I ask the Minister not to overlook that point.</P>
    <P>I consider the Bill to be comprehensive legislation that will be beneficial for this country well into the next century. I compliment the Minister and wish her good luck in the implementation of its provisions.  It would be my hope that we <Col N="1179" /> will clearly see its benefits very quickly after its enactment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that, at long last, this Bill is before the House. It is indeed timely since there has been tremendous public consciousness of the importance of our environment, the necessity to legislate for its protection and provide proper controls.</P>
      <P>I regret that when Deputy Shatter introduced a similar Bill in the House over two years ago it was voted down by the Government.  As a relatively new Member of the House I regret there has been much talk about Dáil reform &mdash; strongly propagated by the Progressive Democrats &mdash; whereas a Bill such as Deputy Shatter's could not have been accepted, a classic example of Government hypocrisy on this issue.  Indeed, it is a sad reflection on the type of politics engaged in by the present Government.</P>
      <P>The protection of our environment is not new in that there have been procedures implemented for its protection over the past few years.  I must pay tribute to local authorities who, with limited resources, have endeavoured to implement policies to protect our environment. Not too long ago many of us recalled the many fish kills that occurred, the subject of much publicity with blame being apportioned to industrialists and farmers alike.  The position in that respect appears to have been improved in recent times, with industrialists and farmers making a valuable contribution to the improvement of our environment.  Many farmers have spent substantial amounts of money on pollution control measures.</P>
      <P>Finance, by way of grant, has been provided to counteract their pollution problems.  However, it must be remembered that farmers are labouring in difficult financial circumstances at present so that, even to attempt to control pollution, causes them a certain degree of financial hardship.  Nonetheless they deserve to be complimented on their recent attempts to control pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> Were I to criticise one aspect of such anti-pollution grants it would be that farmers with non-farm income have been debarred from eligibility.  This factor should be recognised, as it was in the past, in relation to farmers in disadvantaged areas, when farmers with non-farm income were precluded from availing of such disadvantaged area grants, although that anomaly has since been eliminated. I should like to see a similiar position obtain in relation to the anti-pollution grants.  If we are serious about controlling pollution we must give as much encouragement as possible, especially to farmers, in their endeavours to resolve whatever pollution problems they may experience.</P>
    <P>With our prevailing unemployment rate there is pressure on us to attract overseas industries, by way of a positive attitude to encourage industrialists to establish projects here.  However, we must be careful that we do not frighten them away through excessive zeal in relation to anti-pollution controls. Deputy Quill maintained that perhaps there had been such an over-zealous attitude taken, particular in the Cork area. Perhaps emotions take over but we must remember that, at the end of the day, one cannot eat scenery.</P>
    <P>The recent innovation on the part of the Department of the Environment and local authorities to produce environmental impact assessments is most welcome. One main industrial sector targeted by the IDA has been the electronics sector, regarded as a clean industry. However, we need to address what happens to waste products from such industries and how they impact on our environment.  For example, are we taking adequate precautions to prevent such detrimental impact?</P>
    <P>Tourism is most important for our economy, targeted as being a main growth industry by the present Government, and rightly so.  We must ask ourselves if we are doing sufficient to prevent our countryside from being littered with abandoned cars, rubbish bags and so on. In my local authority area &mdash; which I am sure is no different from others &mdash; we <Col N="1181" /> have an environmental officer in charge of such litter, prepared to prosecute if necessary.  Such deterrent is invaluable because, if we are to tackle the pollution problems &mdash; with people being sufficiently irresponsible to abandon cars and dump rubbish &mdash; we must acknowledge that desperate practices warrant desperate remedies.  Yet we see rubbish dumped in bags in bogs, forests and occasionally on the roadside.  What can be done to control or counteract this practice?  In schools it is important to endeavour to inculcate in students an appreciation of their environment.  I am not so sure that we are succeeding in that endeavour at present or whether a greater commitment is not called for in this respect.</P>
    <P>Those of us living near towns where there are late night discos and fast food restaurants will have seen the debris from such outlets strewn on approach roads and on the streets of the towns themselves, a practice engaged in primarily by young people who frequent such places. Many of us will have read tourists criticism in provincial papers, not in relation to the scenery but rather with regard to our attitude to litter, which acts as a deterrent to many from returning here. We must implement a quick clean up in this respect.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear Deputy Quill refer to the changes implemented in our towns and the improvement of our environment generally.  It would be remiss of me not to refer to the Tidy Towns Competition held over the years, which has acted as a stimulus to many townspeople to provide a vibrant, active Tidy Towns Association with the objective of improving their environment.  Here I want to pay tribute to many towns in my county which have been enormously successful in this regard, towns such as Adare and Galbally.  I must compliment the local people who put in so much voluntary work to improve their environment.  A classic example of people's commitment to their town is that of the people in Adare, a commitment that will be evident to anybody driving through that town.  I would go so far as to say that one would <Col N="1182" /> feel a sense of guilt at dropping even a piece of paper on the streets there.  Its people are aware of the beauty of the town and are conscious of the need to preserve it.  It would appear that that is the case in many other towns.  Therefore, it is true that there was generally a consciousness of the need to preserve our environment even prior to the introduction of this Bill.  Nonetheless, there is a long road ahead before we can acknowledge that all have a healthy respect for their environment.</P>
    <P>There has been much concern voiced recently about the quality of our tap drinking water.  As the Minister of State will be aware, much of our drinking water is extracted from rivers and, in order to extract that water, aluminium sulphate or alum is added.  There is need for great caution in the use of this chemical.  We must also ensure that the right type of equipment is provided and properly maintained for such water extraction. One cannot over-emphasise the necessity to have good quality tap water available to all.  A recent survey undertaken demonstrated, from samples tested, that many local authorities were exceeding EC minimum guidelines and, in many cases, even the maximum guidelines.  We all know that one mineral not required by the human body is aluminium and that there has been a recent connection, not yet proven, between aluminium and Alzheimer's disease.  I do not want to be sensational about this but we must endeavour to extract high quality water in order to allay any health fears held by people generally.</P>
    <P>Obviously, in analysing the provisions of this Bill, I compared them with those of Deputy Shatter's Bill introduced two years ago.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not take cognisance of a recommendation embodied in Deputy Shatter's Bill, for the establishment of an environmental committee of this House, the necessity for which is obvious.  It is incumbent on all of us in this House to be well informed of what is taking place with regard to environmental issues.  Perhaps the Minister would address the <Col N="1183" /> feasibility of having that recommendation in Deputy Shatter's Bill incorporated into this one.  In order to function effectively the proposed Environmental Protection Agency must have the requisite manpower.  Will the manpower be delegated from county councils, thus denuding them of appropriate staff?  Will resources be provided to attract the proper technical expertise?  Some Bills such as the Video Recordings Bill and the Marine Institute Bill have not been implemented effectively due to the lack of financial resources to provide manpower. It is essential to provide adequate resources if this Bill is to achieve its laudable objectives.</P>
    <P>The Bill also states that local authorities should produce a report every three years showing how effectively they are monitoring the environment.  Why not produce such a report every year?  It is ludicrous to suggest that an environmental report should be produced every five years.  How effective will that be? Five years is a very long time.</P>
    <P>There are also provisions relating to noise and smell.  I am a member of Foynes Harbour Board.  We are concerned about complaints from residents about noise and smell.  We as a board cannot take the generosity of the community for granted indefinitely and are trying to deal with the situation by taking certain environmental measures.  There is a lack of precise definition in the Bill in dealing with these problems.</P>
    <P>This is a most important Bill.  I am confident that, with modification and serious commitment by the Government to its implementation, the legislation will certainly help in the future to protect our environment.  We would all compliment the Minister of State on the gigantic task she undertook in producing this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this ambitious Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House. Groups throughout the country, industrialists, environmentalists and members of the general public have been crying <Col N="1184" /> out for such a Bill which will help get to grips with the environmental problems arising from industry.</P>
      <P>Some of the fears expressed about possible damage caused to the environment by industry are exaggerated but others may be well founded.  Damage has been caused over the past 50 years due to the absence of stringent measures to control industrialisation.  Industries were established without knowledge of what they entailed and their possible effect on the environment and on human health.  Some industries which gave good employment were dirty industries. I worked for 30 years in the Dunlop factory. Probably it would be impossible to establish such a plant today due to the number of restrictions which would be imposed.  There were other industries in the Cork area which would be classed as dirty, but jobs were scarce and people had no option but to take any opportunity to work.  The interests of the environment were sacrificed.  Some industrialists did not believe it was important to safeguard the health of workers or of the public.  Much damage was done to health where I worked. Eight years following the closure of Dunlops former workers are still awaiting compensation for damage done to their hearing due to the absence of noise controls.  That was before noise was recognised as a pollutant which causes damage to health.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, necessary to achieve a balance.  That is why it is important to have some agency to provide back-up services in the assessment of industry.  In Cork we have the ridiculous position that the Sandoz plant is half built and is yet the subject of a High Court action.  Our system seems to have fallen apart.  This must be remedied as soon as possible and the provisions of this Bill may help.  When genuine objections are raised, they should be considered with the case put by the industrialists and a decision should be made which will be acceptable to everyone.  That will not cut across anybody's constitutional rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will be useless unless the necessary resources are provided for its implementation.  During the last session <Col N="1185" /> we discussed at length the Sea Pollution Bill.  I am apprehensive about its application of that Bill.  It brought us into line with the MARPOL agreement and the provisions will dovetail with this legislation. The Minister for the Marine indicated that the Sea Pollution Bill would be put into effect immediately.  It is ludicrous that ships coming into our territorial waters carrying sewage should be prevented from discharging the sewage in our waters and have to discharge it in the port, following which the local authority dump it into the sea.  Unless the agency are given the necessary funding to implement the legislation the Minister will be wasting her time.  I do not believe the people will accept this legislation unless the agency are given muscle to implement it.  I ask the Minister to look at this aspect.  If the necessary funding is not provided, this Bill will be a flop. Having read both the explanatory memorandum and the Bill, I believe local authorities, harbour boards, industrialists and environmental groups will welcome it.  However, I want to repeat that, without the necessary finance to enforce the legislation, the Minister will be wasting her time.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to some other points.  Reference has been made already to Cork.  I believe the agency will have a major role to play in this area.  For far too long various groups in Cork have been arguing about why industries should be located in certain areas.  Giving the agency a role in this area would put an end to such arguments.  By providing the necessary expertise the agency would be able to do much valuable work attracting industries which will have to comply with certain rules and regulations.  It is very important to spell out clearly the rules and regulations so that there is no waste of resources, and no overlapping of powers given to local authorities, the Department of the Marine and the agency.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the proposed advisory committee.  I think the Minister has indicated that this committee will have a certain amount of muscle.  I have <Col N="1186" /> been a member of a health board advisory committee for many years and, to be honest, there were times when I felt I was wasting my time because nobody seemed to take any notice of what we were doing.  However, I would have to say that the people who worked on health board advisory committees throughout the country did a great deal of work at enormous cost to themselves. The most glaring example of this was the advisory committee in the Southern Health Board area who were, I believe, disbanded by the health board, but who kept on working for another four years. The dedicated members of that committee continued to carry out their work without receiving any expenses because they believed there was a need for this work.  Those are the type of dedicated people we need on advisory committees. From reading the legislation, it would appear that the Minister has in mind setting up an advisory committee who will be able to guide the agency and the Minister of the day on any decisions he or she will have to make.  I hope the Minister will touch on these important points when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>The appointment of public representatives to the advisory committee is a good idea and the Minister should look very closely at this suggestion.  Some people believe the appointment of public representatives from different political parties to committees can lead to in-fighting and argument.  I do not think this is the case.  The appointment of public representatives to the committee of which I was a member for many years led to very good debate and worthwhile proposals which the Minister for Health, in fairness to him, took on board.  Even though that committee had been disbanded, he replied to their submissions. I hope the Minister will give the proposed advisory committee the necessary teeth to ensure that the agency will have the power to carry out their work properly.</P>
    <P>As spokesperson on the Marine for my party, I have to say that the agency should be given powers in regard to coastal protection. We seem to be very lax in this <Col N="1187" /> regard.  Every winter storms cause unbelievable damage to coastal regions, yet we do not have any coastal protection policy.  While I accept that the agency may not be responsible for looking after harbours and sea walls, most local authorities do not have the necessary resources to do this work.  It is a crying shame that in 1991 we still do not have a policy on coastal protection.  As an island nation we should be making strong representations to the EC for funding to enable us to carry out this work.  Many villages and towns along our coast have already been damaged and perhaps the Environmental Protection Agency would have a role to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>If local authorities and the agency are not given the necessary resources to carry out their work properly we will be wasting our time.  I believe the Minister is sincere in this regard.  Over the past number of years she has shown that she has environmental issues at heart.  I want to pay tribute to her for the work she has done in this area.  Fisheries boards have not been given the necessary funding to protect our multi-million pound salmon industry.  It seems to be a case of penny wise, pound foolish, when we curtail measures to protect our rivers and seas. I repeat, the Minister will be wasting her time unless the necessary funding is provided to enable the agency to enforce the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in putting this legislation through the House.  Many amendments were made to the Bill in the Seanad and we will look very closely at it on Committee Stage to see if it can be strengthened.  I believe most people would be in favour of the powers being given to the agency when it comes to high-tech and chemical industries where we seem to be at loggerheads at present.  Groups of people come into meetings lobbying that their industry is not a dirty industry and will not damage the environment.  The environmental groups say the opposite.  That is why I am anxious that this Bill should have a speedy passage through the House.  We cannot afford to be reluctant to get to <Col N="1188" /> grips with the problem of job creation.  I say this deliberately because, while jobs are important in Ireland at present, because of record figures of unemployment, nevertheless what we are planning will probably obtain for the next 200 to 300 years.  That is why I say this legislation is probably one of the most important Bills that will come before this House not only in this session but in the life of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success with the Bill.  I am sure she will accept the goodwill of the House when amendments are put down to this legislation, which is in everyone's interest &mdash; the Minister, the Government, and certainly the general public, industrialists and environmentalists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose if one really wanted to be in a ministry and have the responsibility of doing something in terms of legislating for the future, one could not serve in a better Department than the Department of the Environment. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, every success in the implementation of this Bill.  The Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, should form the basis and bedrock of a protection agency that will carry us through to the end of the next century. It will obviously have to be amended, updated and dealt with in various ways as time goes on, because the Bill is not perfect but it is a start and an important start.  I wish her well in seeing it implemented and, particularly, in seeing that the agency is given the necessary resources to ensure that the common denominator of thought which people in the Seanad and in the Dáil brought here from various organisations, personal interpretations and so on from around the country will result in appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the manual, <i>Environmental Strategy for Europe 1991,</i> of which the Minister will be aware. Those who participated at the meetings in Rotterdam had a common goal in that they saw a direct relationship between a good environment and good business and between economic development and <Col N="1189" /> environmental protection.  They also shared a common concern that demographic pressure and mass poverty could endanger long term sustainability.  That is true and brings us back to the introduction of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  If the resources are not available to ensure that its provisions are implemented then it will be another item of legislation without teeth.</P>
    <P>I have listened to a great number of speakers and read a great deal of their contributions.  Each public representative coming in here has his or her particular priorities in terms of environmental development.  Many people have dealt with sewage effluent, silage and other agricultural effluent, industrial waste and so on, all fundamental to the development of our country. The Government's plan is for the doubling of tourist numbers in the years ahead but without the necessary resources to implement it.</P>
    <P>I represent one of the last unspoilt constituencies of this country on the western outpost of Western Europe.  The legislation now going through the House will have a distinct bearing on the quality of the environment in the west over the next 50 years.  Many issues about which people are confused are now raising their head.  Ignorance of the law and its consequences, and ignorance of the consequences of various developments cause a great fear among people throughout the land.  For instance, areas of scientific interest have been referred to by numerous speakers.  In County Mayo alone there are over 180 areas of scientific interest.  What is an area of scientific interest and who designated it?  It is interesting to note that the elected representatives of the people of County Mayo both on the last local authority and the present local authority are ignorant in many ways of the locations and the reasons areas have been selected as being of scientific interest.  It is a cause of confusion to farmers and farming folk who on the one hand, are advised to sell their ground to planting agencies or to avail of private grants themselves to plant it, they find, when the opportunity <Col N="1190" /> of a sale of land arises, it cannot be availed of because the area has been designated by the Office of Public Works as being one of scientific interest. There is need for either the Department or the proposed new agency to advise local authority members of what is involved.  The Dutch may well spend £30 million in attempting to create a raised bog in Holland.  Naturally, they will fail in the context of the raised bogs which we have but they realised their value once they had disappeared.  The Minister of State in her opening address said:</P>
    <P>Suffice it to say that the strongest economy in Europe is Germany and it is no coincidence that the Germans consider strict environmental controls to be an essential ingredient in their continued prosperity.</P>
    <P>That is true.  The Germans have learned a very harsh lesson throughout two world wars, throughout massive industrial expansion followed by massive industrial pollution.  Obviously we will not be faced with similar problems on the west coast because it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract any outside industry. People have got to rely on their initiative and hope that the development of indigenous industry will bear economic fruit and personal prosperity for our people.  In that context confusion again abounds because these same people who own lands that have been designated as being areas of scientific interest are equally aware that other areas similar in nature to theirs, under the European Directive, can be deemed to be areas of scientific interest or environmentally sensitive areas.  They are equally aware, in terms of environmentally sensitive areas, that compensation exists under that directive.  They genuinely feel that if the European powers-that-be under that directive, and if the Department with responsibility in Ireland, wished to have these grounds taken over and preserved as either environmentally sensitive areas or areas of scientific interest, then funding under the directive should be made avilable as compensatory amounts for the owners of such property.  In dealing <Col N="1191" /> with rural folk the Minister is well aware that, if it is explained clearly in the beginning and if the options available are also explained, there will be much less hindrance, much more understanding in terms of preserving our environment for future generations.  It has been said that we do not inherit our natural environment from our ancestors but rather that we borrow it from our children.  That is true.</P>
    <P>In the implementation of this Bill I am concerned that the Minister of State should get every conceivable help from her senior colleagues in Cabinet.  If the financial constraints on the Government to balance the books in terms of the <i>Programme for Government</i> drawn up recently mean that there will be something of the order of £400 million in cut-backs at the end of next January, surely this places a significant burden on the Minister of State, and on her senior Minister whoever that might be tomorrow, to obtain the necessary moneys so that the controls, advice and monitoring system of this agency can be implemented?  In that context, it is critical that, in preparation for the allocation of funds for 1993-98 under the Structural Funds, our Government seek as much as possible in order to preserve and protect our natural environment.</P>
    <P>In 1941 Archbishop Walsh of the diocese of Tuam said that because of the mineral wealth beneath our soil there should not be any need for any able-bodied male to emigrate.  Fifty years on, his successor, Archbishop Cassidy, under enormous pressure and having deeply considered the case, has been moved to say that while there may be gold on the slopes of Croagh Patrick it was not as valuable as the tradition of the mountain in the minds and hearts of the people.  What does this mean in the context of the implementation of this Bill?  Last night, in the final drafting of the county development plan for County Mayo, councillors decided to ban, in that plan, all mineral extraction under the Minerals Development Act, 1940, in a specified area ranging from Croagh Patrick to the Delphi Doo <Col N="1192" /> Lough valley area.  This area was given protection in part by the Minister for Energy last year.</P>
    <P>In balancing modern technology and sophisticated methods of mining against the possible economic potential and availability of long term jobs one is confused. Sources tell me that there could be up to £800 million of gold mineral wealth in that region.  If that is the case and the county council ban all mineral extraction, what options remain?  Who has the dominating influence in this area? Under the mining Acts the Minister for Energy is responsible for the development of mineral extraction throughout the land.  In the last two years environmental impact studies have had to be carried out before mining could take place.  If a mining company apply to a local authority for planning permission to extract minerals from under the soil, having carried out an environmental impact study and deemed that there would be no great damage to the local environment, what is the role of the agency?  What is the legal effect of the development plan prepared by the elected representatives of that local authority as against the constitutional responsibility of the Minister for Energy of the day under the Minerals Development Act, 1940?</P>
    <P>If one weighs the development in terms of jobs and the boost to the local economy as against the preservation of the natural environment, where will the balance lie?  In terms of the applications who has the dominating influence?  If concillors ban mineral extraction in an area, where will the resources come from to develop tourism to attract double the number of tourists in the years ahead? Will the Minister clarify that.  I will raise the point on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have referred to the epidemic of littering throughout the country.  Under this Bill the Minister should emphasise that the desecration of our countryside by litter is a social sin. There is not any scene as appalling as tourists walking beaches and in isolated areas of immense natural beauty that have been destroyed by plastic bags <Col N="1193" /> and rubbish of all description thrown there mainly by our citizens.  It is incomprehensible that people will drive ten, 15 or 20 miles to dump rubbish rather than avail of local services or of free entry to local authority dumping areas.  Every children's programme shown on RTE or broadcast on local radio stations should educate children in an anti-litter campaign. Television and radio programmes have a huge influence on young minds. The Minister should ensure that her colleague, the Minister for Education, should encourage every teacher and parent to tell children that the indiscriminate dumping of litter destroys somebody else's property as well as their own.</P>
    <P>On one of my first visits to the Department of Education when I was Minister of State at that Department one of the architects told me that on his first job in Geneva, full of pride at being a young Irishman in that job, after the war, he walked down a street and tipped the ash of a cigar on the street.  He had not gone ten paces when a lady tapped him on the shoulder and said, &ldquo;in our country we do not do that&rdquo;.  The Minister should leave as her legacy an imprint on everybody's mind that littering is a social sin.  Until people remind each other of what is involved things will not improve a great deal.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and other speakers, referred to sewage outfalls, sewage treatment works and so on.  Such works are enormously expensive.  In the Clew Bay, which Thackeray described as being one of the most beautiful sights he had ever seen, it is only now that the preliminary plans for the treatment of effluent are being finalised.  It really means that if the bay itself is to be restored to pristine condition there must be a very long outfall because of the geography of the land.  This means a much greater cost to the taxpayer, the ratepayer and the local authority.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann being of the opinion that it is necessary that there be an explicit, effective and well understood code of ethics governing elected politicians, as well as State board members and senior officials of Government Departments and State companies, and that it is necessary to create a greater openness and accountability in public affairs through freedom of information therefore resolves:</P>
      <P>(1)  to establish a Parliamentary Ethics Commission (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;the Commission&rdquo;) consisting of the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General and a Judge of the High Court to perform, <i>inter alia</i>, the functions set out hereunder;</P>
      <P>(2)  to request the Commission to draw up, after consultation with the Committees for Procedure and Privileges of the Dáil and Seanad, a code of ethics governing MEPs, Dáil Deputies, Senators and Councillors and to make provision for the subsequent enforcement of such a code;</P>
      <P>(3)  that the code referred to in (2) above will deal, <i>inter alia</i>, with relationships with outside bodies, disclosure, artificial transactions and abstention from involvement where conflict of interest may arise;</P>
      <P>(4)  to request the Commission to draw up a detailed provision for a register of politicians' interests, on the basis that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of Ministers and Chairmen of Parliamentary Committees, the material in the register would be available for public inspection as of the time of their appointment and for five years after their appointment has ceased,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  in the case of other politicians, the material would be available at <Col N="1195" /> all times for inspection by the Commission, and would be published in any case where the Commission felt this was necessary in the light of its investigation of allegations made to it of breaches of the code of ethics;</P>
    <P>(5)  that the Government should draw up a scheme for more substantial State funding of political parties (excluding those who support violence directly or indirectly), on a basis of a ratio of the parties' proportionate electoral strengths to the size of Gross National Product, to cover separately ongoing expenses and election campaigns, so as to reduce the reliance of parties on private donations;</P>
    <P>(6)  that the Commission be requested to make recommendations to Dáil Éireann as to a maximum contribution that might be made by any one individual, organisation, company or group of associated companies to any one political party or to any one individual candidate, and as to a maximum amount that might be spent in an individual election campaign by either a party or an individual candidate;</P>
    <P>(7)  that all political parties and candidates keep accounts of income and expenditure, and that these be lodged for inspection with the Commission so that the Commission may determine whether there have been any breaches of the provisions outlined above;</P>
    <P>(8)  that a Freedom of Information Act be enacted at the earliest opportunity so that every Irish citizen shall have free access to official documents, including tapes and database, as a normal democratic right of citizenship, subject only to the restrictions which may be necessary having regard to:</P>
    <P>(a)  the security of the State or its relations with a foreign State or international organisations,</P>
    <P>(b)  the central finance policy, monetary policy, or foreign exchange policy of the State,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> (c)  the inspection control or other supervisory activities of a public authority,</P>
    <P>(d)  the interest of presenting or prosecuting a crime,</P>
    <P>(e)  the public economic interest,</P>
    <P>(f)  the protection of the personal integrity or economic conditions of private citizens and</P>
    <P>(g)  the protection of the environment;</P>
    <P>(9)  that where a Minister, or public body, claims a restriction of access, under paragraph 8 above, a citizen shall have right of appeal to the Parliamentary Ethics Commission whose ruling shall be binding on all concerned, subject only to the courts of the land.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity this evening of moving this important motion in Private Members' time on behalf of my party.</P>
    <P>As I made clear in a debate earlier this year on a Bill that was before the House in Private Members' time, Fine Gael though not committed to the precise terms of the Bill, gave strong support to the principle involved.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that on 28 November 1990, almost exactly a year ago, Fine Gael proposed the creation of a parliamentary ethics commission composed of the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General and a High Court Judge.  The Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton, at his press conference launching the document <i>Integrity in Public Life</i> said:</P>
    <P>Businessmen who seek help from the State, whether through grants or tax concessions, must know that the same rules apply to them as to everyone else. There should be no chosen champions, no sweetheart deals and no discretionary concessions.  The same rules should apply to all and be seen to apply ... Fine Gael believes that this requires that there be legislation to <Col N="1197" /> guarantee high levels of integrity in public life.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton was certainly very far-seeing in the opening paragraph of his statement almost exactly a year ago, given the events that this House and the general public have witnessed since then. To the many self-satisfied businessmen and private commentators around the country, let me say that it is not only in politics that we need a code of ethics. Indeed it was not politicians who were to the forefront as bad apples in the bag of apples but businessmen and businessmen associated with politicians.  As far as it goes we must put our house in order here so that we can make others put their houses in order.  We must act as a Legislature to protect the public interest by making sure people who are carrying on sweetheart arrangements, be they businessmen, trade unionists, judges, journalists, politicians or anyone else, do not behave in a way contrary to the public interest while they are in a position to control a market, a marketplace or the supply of goods or labour. The starting place must be here in this House and what I am proposing today is just that.</P>
    <P>All the power in a democracy does not lie in any one place.  All the political power, according to the Constitution, is spread between the Dáil and the Seanad on the elected side, to the Executive which is answerable to the Dáil, the Judiciary, the President.  In recent times, however, we have seen the development of political power outside this House on a scale unprecedented and unforeseen when the 1937 Constitution was written. We have seen power transferred to what is broadly called the social partners.  They not only sit in with Cabinet Ministers but sit in with civil servants most of the time and make rules, regulations and decisions which affect the destiny of all of us and indeed of our children, not just in the economic area but in such areas as contraception, tax concessions and social welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect to use the full 40 minutes.</P>
      <P>These social partners are not being asked to make a declaration of interest, yet they are in there operating almost like a parliament separate from the national elected Parliament.  I have no objection to them being involved.  In fact, I think it is a good thing that there should be consensus.  However, everybody is being involved in that consensus except the majority of people elected to this House, and I include in that Government backbenchers. What I am saying is that we should start by establishing a code of ethics here, a register of Members' interests, a list of contributions to political parties.  Then we should follow it through to all the other power bases in this State and make sure that everybody is honest and above-board so that only one interest is served by us, as a Legislature, setting down rules.  After the people, this House is the most sovereign institution.  If we get our act right we can compel all those other power bases not to abuse power and to use it only in the public interest.</P>
      <P>We reiterate the proposal here tonight to include under this ethics commission the supervision of public representatives, members of State boards and agencies and senior Government officials.  In addition, we are seeking the setting up of a register of Members' interests and greater State funding for political parties coupled with restrictions on the level of private contributions that can be made to political parties for political campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I last raised this matter here in <Col N="1199" /> the House the Minister made a point about political party funding and said he was prepared to consider this matter.  A Government backbencher said the Minister had not said any such thing or said it in different terms.  There seemed to be a consensus between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and I think the Labour Party as well &mdash; I see Deputy Howlin nodding &mdash; but the people who came out strongest against us on that occasion were the Progressive Democrats.  Not only was it the Progressive Democrats who came out against us, it was the chairman of the Progressive Democrats, in other words, one of those non-elected power bases.  I think it is wrong that any of us should seek to gain party political advantage in what is a question of national interest. We all know in our hearts and souls that it is time the vexed question of State funding for political parties was addressed fully.  We should not seek to gain cheap advantage over each other by putting party political interest before the national interest.  It is not, I suppose, a happy task to have to tell the electorate this but the electorate should be told: it is time the State took on the role of funding political parties.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that in the motion, which appears on the Order Paper in my name and that of the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, we are proposing that not only should the code of ethics apply to elected politicians, it should also apply to State board members and senior officials of Government Departments and State companies.  We also believe that the Parliamentary Ethics Commission should be seen to be independent and comprise three persons who are above reproach &mdash; the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General, who audits State spending, and a High Court judge.  We suggest the commission should be asked, after consultation with the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of both the Dáil and Seanad, to draw up a code of ethics governing Members.  We feel that the code should deal, among other things, with relationships with outside bodies, disclosure, artificial transactions <Col N="1200" /> and abstention from involvement where conflict of interest may arise.</P>
    <P>Members may say it is difficult to legislate for and regulate this area.  I have to accept that it is not easy to govern legislation in this area but, if we peruse the Register of Members' Interests in the British Parliament, we will find that it lists nine headings under which members must register their interests.  These include remunerated directorships of companies, public or private; remunerated employments or offices; remunerated trades, professions or vocations; the names of clients when the interests referred to above include personal services by the Member which arise out of or relate in any manner to his membership of the House; financial sponsorship as a parliamentary candidate where, to the knowledge of the members the sponsorship in any case exceeds 25 per cent of the candidate's election expenses; overseas visits relating to or arising out of membership of the House or where the cost of any such visit has not been wholly borne by the Member or public funds; any payments or any material benefits or advantages received from or on behalf of foreign governments; and land and property of substantial value or from which a substantial income is derived.  The requirement is to register the general nature of the interest rather than a detailed list of the holdings.</P>
    <P>We suggest that there are ways of listing Members' interest which would meet the objective of declaring interests so as to prevent a conflict of interest or leaving a Member open to the possibility of being asked questions without compromising the right of a Member to carry on legitimate interests outside the House.  This, after all, is a very uncertain business as those of us who have had to fight five general elections in the last ten years will know.  The turnover in this House during the past few years bears witness to this. Let us be realistic.  We do not want to make things difficult or impossible for anybody; public life is difficult enough.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of a sword hanging <Col N="1201" /> over Members' heads or placing everybody under suspicion but rather of allowing this area, where a possible conflict of interest may arise, to be governed. Members would set down their interests and, in the event of an allegation of a conflict of interest, the Parliamentary Ethics Commission would investigate it.  That is as much a protection for Members as it is a taxing of their time and interests.</P>
    <P>I have just given an outline of what could be included.  The Parliamentary Ethics Commission should draw up a detailed provision for a register of politicians' interests, and we are suggesting that Ministers and chairpersons of parliamentary committees should be treated differently from other Members of the House in terms of the period and level of the declaration.  We also feel the Government should draw up a scheme for substantial State funding of political parties to meet not just their ongoing expenses but their election expenses, also on a fair and reasonable basis.  We further propose that all parties and candidates should keep accounts of their income and expenditure which should be submitted to the Parliamentary Ethics Commission for examination in given circumstances.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that in the opening paragraph we are seeking an explicit, effective and well understood code of ethics governing elected politicians as well as State board members and senior officials of Government Departments and State companies.  What influence can we wield which would be of interest to persons outside the House? For instance, we can wield influence when it comes to giving contracts, particularly where the proper tendering procedures are not followed.  Sadly, there have been such cases.  I have no evidence which shows that there was wrongdoing in any case, but this is one area where politicians can wield influence for which businessmen might be thankful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am laying down areas which are open to abuse, I am not saying they have been abused, areas of legislation, tax breaks, company law &mdash; either in what it contains or delaying it &mdash;which might be of benefit not just to businessmen but others outside this House.  We could protect State boards from parliamentary investigation at the instigation of the director; we could arrange to ask questions in the House which might embarrass a competitor of a particular businessman, advance the interest of a trade union, an association or group; we could retard parliamentary reform to prevent modern legislative overseeing of the private community.  Is it fair to say that, over the years, lawyers who have predominated in the House in the past may have prevented us from reforming the Four Courts in the application of the law?  Where there is an allegation of a conflict of interest, if there is a declaration which can be investigated, if an ethics commission are in place, they will be in a position to carry out such investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason Fine Gael are using Private Members' time tonight to again highlight the need for an ethics commission, a register of Members' interests and State funding for political parties, accompanied by a restriction on private donations, is that the public have been scandalised by recent revelations of deals, double deals, multi-deals and statements and admissions of private <Col N="1203" /> business and political friendships all intermingled, intertwined and interrelated. Even if the multiplicity of inquiries going on at present do not turn up specific instances of conflict of interests, surely it is wrong that such a multiplicity of arrangements and relationships can be in place in the first instance without any public declaration or potential conflict of interests being known to the public or, for that matter, to the public's representatives?</P>
    <P>Our primary duty is to protect the public interest; we are entitled to have outside interests and many of us do, but interests should be declared.  No such declaration takes place at present on an organised scale.  A code of ethics, overseen by a parliamentary ethics commission consisting of the three persons I named, could allow for a public declaration of certain interests and perhaps a private declaration to the commission of others, for example, the interests of a spouse.  The latter interest might be made public by the commission only if they could bring the public duty of a public representative &mdash; or servant &mdash; into conflict with his or his family's private interests.  In this way we could overcome the need to declare family interests without unduly interfering with the right to privacy of persons who, after all, are not in public life.</P>
    <P>Where allegations of conflict of interest are made it would not be necessary to set up a tribunal of inquiry or to appoint inspectors; it would simply be a requirement that the parliamentary ethics commission examine and report on any allegations of conflict of interests either at the behest of a Member of the Dáil or Seanad, a member of the public or on the initiative of the commission.  The ethics commission could set down what should be declared by Members of the Dáil and Seanad in a register of Members interests, such register to be open to public examination.  They might themselves keep a private register of the family interests of Members.</P>
    <P>It is already a requirement that gifts received or made in excess of a given <Col N="1204" /> amount &mdash; I think the figure is something in the region of £200 although it may be as low as £50, I cannot recall the exact figure &mdash; must already be declared in the Appropriation Accounts which are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If that convention has been departed from it should be reintroduced and where the political head of a Department receives a private gift for himself, his spouse or any of his family, that too should be declared in the Appropriation Accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Once in place this practice could be followed, albeit in a modified fashion, to suit the particular circumstances, by State boards and agencies and by senior officials of Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I repeat that if the Houses of the Oireachtas got their act together &mdash; the same applies to State agencies, boards and offices &mdash; it would then be in order for the Legislature to require others to make similar declarations where a conflict of interests arise which are detrimental to the public interest.  I include in that judges, journalists, trade unionists and private business interests.  With regard to the latter, I note from the document <i>Responsibilities of Directors in Ireland &mdash; Your Questions Answered</i> published by Deloitte and Touche with a foreword by the Honourable Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, that directors are advised they &ldquo;must declare to the board when you, or a person connected with you, has an interest in a contract or proposed contract with the company ...&rdquo; Further on the document states:</P>
    <P>The company is required to keep a record of all declarations of interest and make the record available for inspection by the shareholders and others.  The record must be produced at every general meeting of the company and any meeting of directors where requested by a director.</P>
    <P>The Institute of Directors which, I understand, is at a developmental stage, could do a great public service by bringing their requirements to the attention of directors more vigorously, especially in the public <Col N="1205" /> sector.  It could be their duty to bring these and other requirements to the attention of directors of State boards. One wonders if the directors of Greencore and their subsidiaries, Telecom Éireann, UPH, Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Holidays, NCB, Goodman and a host of other companies, are aware of these requirements.  If they are, it is a well kept secret.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about these issues in the recent past.  I am not concerned with seeking to portray only the Government parties' shortcomings.  My motion seeks to address shortcomings on all sides of the House.  Some time ago allegations were made about the contributions by GPA and Dr. Tony Ryan personally to political parties.  There was great surprise all round&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary in the circumstances of my speech.  There was great surprise when he publicly declared the extent of his contributions and the parties to whom he had made them.  We might well be surprised if others like Mr. Goodman, Mr. Desmond and Dr. Smurfit were asked to make a similar declaration. Perhaps they are not huge contributors to political party funds. However, from all the recent controversy, one thing should be clear, political parties in Government or in Opposition are required to pursue the public interest above all else and should not be beholden in a major way to a small number of large contributors who can always apply the censure of cutting off supplies.  Surely it is the State's job to fund political parties in a modern democracy such as has evolved here over the last 70 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that all private political contributions should be stopped; people have the democratic right to support the political party &mdash; or candidate &mdash; of their choice but such declarations should be limited and declared publicly. <Col N="1206" /> This should be accompanied by a restriction on the amount of money which political parties can spend on political campaigns with a further restriction on the amount of money individual candidates can spend at election time or in a period running up to an election.</P>
    <P>Other parliaments have strict requirements for members, including Canada and Australia, although there is some dispute about the requirement that a spouse of a member should declare his or her income.  Britain has such a system but, despite the details I mentioned earlier, it has shortcomings.  Having met recently the Registrar of Members' Interests in the British House of Commons I understand they are updating their register; we do not even have a register to update.  They are updating the whole question of contributions to political parties, but we do not have any such guidelines to update.  In Britain the restriction on spending at election time is so tight that if you happen to spend money in your constituency, on advertising your clinics or whatever, in a year in which a general election is called it is tough luck on the Member of Parliament because that expenditure is considered as election expenditure and is deducted from the amount they can spend at election time.  Therefore, it is not just at election time but also in the run-up to an election that there are rules in place. There are other ways of operating than those we have traditionally used.</P>
    <P>I can say with my hand on my heart that if there are a few millionaires in this House they are not all in Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, but is it right that some wealthy Members of this House or candidates should do nothing for four years and then splash out £40,000 or £50,000 on an election campaign while ordinary Joe Soap Deputies who break their hearts in here for four years can hardly scrape together the finance necessary to engage in a campaign?  Some people have caravans and all sorts of personal publicity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is close to all our hearts if the truth were known.  These matters need to be dealt with if the fairness of the system is to be improved.  The public are entitled to know who funds presidential election campaigns, general election campaigns and local election campaigns for parties or candidates.  No party or candidate would make this information available voluntarily because it could put them or their parties under scrutiny while the rest of us escape disclosure. All parties and individuals should be required equally and simultaneously to make such a declaration.</P>
      <P>The problem faced by political parties at present is not the amount of money they receive but rather the lack of funds. I doubt if there is any major party in the House which is not seriously in debt.  That is possibly compromising to the parties in the first instance.  Is it right that parties should be dramatically in debt?  Is it right that Deputies and Senators should be dramatically in debt?  It is portrayed regularly by one or two journalists &mdash; most journalists are fair and reasonable people and give us a fair run in this House &mdash; that Members of the House are cigar smoking, champagne swilling fat cats on £80,000 a year, with interminable pensions. However, the reality is that some of us receive very few expenses and have huge outgoings.  We have fought election after election on an unprecedented scale in recent years.  Is it right that Deputies, Senators and parties should be in debt to such an extent, in many cases not because they have mismanaged their campaign or their parties, as is the throw away line to follow?  Some of us manage our affairs a lot better than some newspapers manage theirs.  Because there has been such pressures on us and our families some of us have not recouped our losses, and will find it difficult to do so &mdash; indeed some of us have to write quiz books every year to balance our accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Life is not all roses for people in this House and for parties.  Maybe it is time we stopped going to the private sector for contributions.  Incidentally, it is not a case of always getting money from the <Col N="1208" /> private sector.  I referred earlier to the great surprise that parties were not receiving an amount of funds from one particular individual or his companies, when people talk about getting substantial amounts.  The reality is that, in some circumstances, Deputies have become raffle ticket sellers and fund raisers on a professional and permanent basis for party headquarters, constituency organisations and their personal election debts.  People cross to the other side of the road when they see us coming and refuse to take our telephone calls in case we ask them to buy a ticket. That should not be the role of a Member of Parliament.  It demeans Parliament and Members of the House.  It is time that something ws done in this regard.  Never mind what the chairman of the Progressive Democrats has to say, I will deal with him.  If he wants to carry out reform he should look at what goes on in the Four Courts.</P>

      <P>The comprehensive motion placed before the House tonight by Fine Gael is not an end in itself; it is a beginning.  We are proposing that a parliamentary ethics commission oversee the introduction of an ethics code which would cover not only the public service and public agencies but might spread to the private sector so that public and private business and related affairs can be carried on in an above-board manner and be seen to be so.  Furthermore, Fine Gael do not believe that allegations of impropriety should be made against public representatives, public servants or members of a State board in any light or throw-away manner.  It is a serious matter to make such allegations.  They should be made only where there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for making them.  In such circumstances the ethics commission which we propose would be in a position to investigate these matters, to get to the truth of the matter and, if necessary, show up for what they are those who make cheap or false allegations.  Let us leave the holier than thou mantle to one <Col N="1209" /> side for the moment.  It is in all our interests, and particularly in the public interest, that a parliamentary ethics commission be established, that there be a register of Members' interests, State funding of parties together with a control on private contributions and the level of expenditure of parties and candidates. None of us should be afraid to say so.</P>
      <P>It is time to consider including in the Constitution an oath of office for you, Sir and for Members of the House.  We ran away from the old oath of office for various reasons.  However, the Constitution proposes an oath of office for members of the Judiciary.  Article 34.5.1º states:</P>
      <P>In the presence of Almighty God I ...do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my knowledge and power execute the office of.... without fear or favour, affection or illwill towards any man, and that I will uphold the Constitution and the laws.

    <P>&mdash;the introduction of regulations which will include provisions to apply to State bodies, to regulate business standards, including provisions that:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Board members and any persons involved in the management and/or control of such companies will be required to disclose any direct or indirect personal interest in the company's business,</P>
    <P>&mdash;There will be severe penalties for non-disclosure, including forfeiture and recovery of all clandestine profits or personal gains made at the company's expense;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the requirement that persons proposed for appointment to Boards of all State agencies and companies should make a declaration of any interests relevant to their membership of such bodies;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of an appropriate code of conduct for employees in each State company, together with an adequate system of internal audit;</P>

      <P>The Deputies proposing this motion will not be surprised to learn that the Government are substituting a counter-motion to highlight certain aspects of the recently published Programme for Government, which address and supersede several of the points raised in the present motion.  The remaining parts of the motion are misconceived, if not, indeed mischievous, in some respects.  The motion as put down seeks to draw together a number of matters which are at best, loosely related and, in some cases, totally unrelated.  It ignores the very significant initiatives taken by the Government.  It has all the appearance of a motion which is aimed at attracting media attention rather than attempting to deal with the real issues which have given rise to public concern in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will comment later on the specific areas and functions proposed in the motion but, first, I must address the very concept of the new body which it is proposed to establish &mdash; the parliamentary ethics commission.  The Government are faced with very stringent budgetary targets in the period up to 1993.  The achievement of these targets will require very tight control of public expenditure. Yet it is clear that Deputies Bruton and Mitchell envisage the establishment of yet another State body in the shape of a parliamentary ethics commission.  It seems inevitable that the commission would need a secretariat which, on past <Col N="1212" /> experience, will grow of its own accord unless tight control is exercised.  But because of the sensitive nature of its operations, such a secretariat would be almost immune from any interference by the Legislature.  This is a recipe for increasing the Exchequer pay and pensions bill and adding yet another layer of bureaucracy. Deputy John Bruton, when he was in Government, spent a lot of time talking about cutting back on what he called quangos, but now he wishes to create another one.</P>
    <P>Altogether apart from the financial considerations, I am most surprised that Deputies Bruton and Mitchell are proposing that the function of ensuring that proper standards of behaviour prevail among Members of this House be handed over to an outside body, however honourable and worthy its members may be.  The role proposed for the body would clearly overlap with and undermine the Committees on Procedure and Privileges. It seems to me highly questionable that any outside body should be involved in the running of the internal affairs of the Oireachtas.  Article 15.10 of the Constitution gives the Houses of the Oireachtas the exclusive right to determine their own rules and procedure.  To have an outside commission interfering with the rights of Members would seem to be quite inconsistent with the spirit of that provision.</P>
    <P>Article 15.10 reflects a very basic and long-standing principle which is fundamental to our Constitution and with which I am sure the Deputies are familiar &mdash; that is, the separation of powers between the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.  The maintenance of a proper balance between the three branches of Government requires that each branch must accept responsibility for its affairs and refrain from interfering in the affairs of the other branches.  I cannot see how the imposition of the proposed commission would be consistent with this fundamental concept in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>If there are things in the behaviour of the Members of this House which are upsetting Deputies, why do they not <Col N="1213" /> bring such matters to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which would seem the natural forum for such concerns? To suggest, as the motion clearly does, that this House is not capable of administering its own affairs, in effect, is an insult to every Member of this House and to those who elected them.  Is it being suggested that the electorate have elected a Legislature which is so corrupt that we cannot order our own business or regulate our own Members?  There is not one jot of evidence to support such a contention and I am sure the electorate, no matter what their party leanings, would not accept such an insult to their capacity to decide who will represent them.  Of course, there may be some in this House who feel that their expert knowledge entitles them to say what kind of people the electorate should choose, who would like to appoint such people directly without the bother of elections. We reject such arrant nonsense.  We have been elected to do a job, must do it and I have total faith in the electorate to exact the penalty if we fail.</P>
    <P>Deputies may argue that the proposed commission would consult the Committees on Procedure and Privileges and that this should allay any fears.  This would not be good enough.  As I said earlier, I am not satisfied that the machinery of State requires any further layers of bureaucracy but, even leaving aside this fundamental point, consultation between the Committees on Procedure and Privileges and the commission would not guarantee agreement on recommendations.  Once the consultation had been completed, the commission would be free to exert pressures on the Members of this and the Upper House to such an extent that we could be reduced to shadow-play.</P>
    <P>The motion envisages that the proposed commission would determine rules of conduct for Members of the European Parliament.  I imagine that the European Parliament could have serious reservations about the prospect of a distinguished but unelected trio making <Col N="1214" /> rules for some of its Members.  The Deputy's party like to talk about their commitment to Europe but, when it comes to a concrete issue like this, there seems to be a distrust of Europe.  For the Government, I can say that there is no hesitation in leaving the regulation of Members of the European Parliament to that Parliament.</P>
    <P>With regard to councillors, I wonder what right a parliamentary ethics commission would have in interfering at local level.  Local councillors already make a declaration of their interests.  This declaration should be sufficient to prevent any hidden wrongdoing but if there is a need for further safeguards, it is hardly a matter for a parliamentary commission.</P>
    <P>As to the register of Members' interests, I am afraid that this motion seems to betray total ignorance of the contents of the recently published Programme for Government.  If I might quote directly from it:</P>
    <P>A register of Members material interests will be established from September 1992, and available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>In fact, I think this provision goes further, in the case of backbenchers, than the proposals in this motion.  The details of the operation of this register will be worked out in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and any comments which the Deputies may have on this matter might more profitably be directed at that committee.</P>
    <P>On the question of public funding of political parties, once again the main Opposition party have attempted to link this question with the general issue of ethical standards in public life.  I suspect a degree of opportunism here, in effect that they are trying to carry this proposal through on a wave of enthusiasm for new procedures concerning standards of individual conduct.  We are not prepared to go along with this linkage.  The proposal would involve significant additional expenditure at a time when constraints on public expenditure are affecting many public services.  I am not at all sure that the taxpayer would welcome being forced <Col N="1215" /> to contribute to political parties.  This is, in any event, a complex question, the pros and cons of which would have to be debated at length.  We are not prepared to allow this matter to be rushed through without proper consideration nor are we prepared to defer action on improving standards in public life while it is properly considered.</P>
    <P>As regards State bodies, I would like, first, to give some background on the different types of bodies which exist under this heading, how and why they have come into being, and the manner in which they are answerable to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>State bodies are broadly of two kinds, commercial &mdash; sometimes called trading bodies and non-commercial &mdash; or nontrading &mdash; bodies.  The commercial bodies fund the major part of their operations from trading revenue without current Exchequer subvention, while the non-trading bodies rely on the Exchequer for the major part of their income.</P>
    <P>The process by which the commercial State sector evolved was essentially an <i>ad hoc</i> one, based on responses to various needs at various times.  Considerations of national policy and the unwillingness or inability of the private sector to undertake certain tasks were the main factors contributing to their development. Because they are providers of goods and services in the marketplace, commercial State bodies operate with normal commercial freedom subject, of course, to the overriding consideration of the public interest.  The accepted practice is that, while the appropriate Minister is responsible for their overall policy, the bodies themselves have independence in conducting day-to-day operations.  Management is under the control of a board appointed by the appropriate Minister or the Government.  The commercial State bodies play a significant role in the Irish economy and are represented in many key sectors.</P>
    <P>The non-commercial sector consists generally of organisations established by the State to carry out promotional or regulatory duties.  These bodies were <Col N="1216" /> established so that functions which would normally be performed by Government Departments could be better performed outside the Civil Service structure. Because of this, while the appropriate Minister is accountable for policy, day-to-day activities are matters for the bodies themselves.  I would make the point, however, that non-commercial bodies are subject to closer and more regular supervision than their commercial counterparts.  This is because their functions are mainly akin to those of Government Departments and their funding comes largely from the Exchequer through voted moneys.</P>
    <P>Despite the emphasis on providing goods and services for the marketplace, commercial State bodies differ from firms in the private sector in several significant respects, namely: they are in public ownership, having been established or acquired with public funds; a substantial proportion of total national resources is under their control; some enjoy monopoly or quasi-monopoly positions in strategic sectors of the economy and some are required to engage in activities of a social or non-commercial nature, having regard to wider national considerations.</P>
    <P>As the ownership of State bodies is vested in the State, the ownership rights exercised by a Minister are on behalf of the community as a whole.  The interest of the body is essentially, therefore, the public interest and the directors are obliged at all stages to have regard to considerations of public policy in their operations.  Such considerations do not arise so acutely in the case of private sector bodies, which are predominantly profit-oriented.  Directors of State bodies are accountable to the appropriate Minister for the proper discharge of business within the relevant policy framework. The Minister is, in turn, answerable to the Oireachtas for the general policy and performance of any State body for which he is responsible.</P>
    <P>The reports and accounts and operational results of the commercial State bodies are subject to examination by the <Col N="1217" /> Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  The committee may also examine common issues in relation to board responsibility, structure and organisation, accountability and financing, together with the relationship with central Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The chairmen and chief executives of such bodies are normally required to appear before the Committee to answer questions in relation to the affairs of their organisation.</P>
    <P>In the case of commercial State bodies there are, broadly speaking, two types of legal entity.  A State body may be constituted as a statutory corporation, or board, by its own separate statute.  Such a statute usually sets out the powers and functions of the entity, restrictions and obligations on it, the manner of appointment of its board and staff and so on.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, a State body may be formed as a limited liability company, an ordinary company registered under the Companies Acts, in which all or almost all of the shares are held by a Government Minister.  The tradition has been that the shares are held by the Minister for Finance, because of his powers and functions under the Constitution and the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, although in a few cases the shares are held by the Minister under whose aegis the body in question operates.  In nearly all cases of this kind, however, a specific statute is also enacted.  This gives the Oireachtas an opportunity of debating the policy issues relating to the mandate of the body in question.</P>
    <P>Non-commercial bodies can be established on either a statutory or a non-statutory basis.  The statute will usually provide for the appointment of directors and staff and deal with the question of funding.  In the case of non-statutory bodies, authority for Exchequer funding is provided solely by the Appropriation Act and the normal conditions relating to the payment of grants-in-aid apply.</P>
    <P>So much, then, for the background to the State sector, both commercial and non-commercial.  It is important that we know what precisely we are talking about <Col N="1218" /> when discussing this subject.  Considerations that apply to commercial plcs do not always apply to boards or authorities. Commercial State bodies give rise to issues which may not arise in the case of their non-commercial counterparts.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a comment about the supervision of these bodies.  There are already in existence a number of mechanisms designed to assist both the Department of Finance and parent Departments in exercising their supervisory roles in this area.  In carrying out this role, however, care has to be taken, particularly in the case of commercial bodies, that the principle of the autonomy of these bodies in their day to day operations is not diluted.  There is a fine balance to be drawn here, and this is why I was at some pains to point out the particular features of the various kinds of State bodies which we have.</P>
    <P>Various statutes governing the activities of State bodies give the Minister concerned, and in many instances the Minister for Finance, an important role in crucial areas of operations.  These include the appointment of directors; borrowing by the body concerned, with or without State guarantee, receiving annual reports and accounts; the formats of these accounts as well as the establishment of subsidiaries in some cases.  Capital budgets are examined in the context of the public capital programme, while major capital projects, whether involving Exchequer funding or not, are subject to scrutiny.  The corporate plans of the bodies concerned are also subject to examination.  Indeed, the usual complaint from the State sector is that Departments and Ministers interfere excessively in their affairs.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised, however, that while procedures can be refined and improved, perfection is elusive.  One cannot legislate against dishonesty.  All that can be done is to put in place the best possible systems, including systems of internal audit, to discourage unacceptable behaviour and impose strict sanctions where such behaviour occurs.</P>
    <P>The revised Programme for Government contains a number of pledges relating <Col N="1219" /> to the State sponsored sector, in particular in relation to the issue of disclosure of interests, and to the operation of the bodies in question in accordance with the highest standards of ethics and behaviour.</P>
    <P>As well as the question of directors'/ management disclosure of interest, employees' codes of conduct, internal audit functions and the issue of competitive tendering are all mentioned.</P>
    <P>Every one of these issues is, in fact, addressed in a report which has recently been completed by the Secretary of the Department of Finance on the principles which should govern the relationship between Departments of State and the State bodies under their aegis, together with subsidiary and associated companies of the bodies in question.  This report and its findings are now under active consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>The examination conducted by this eminent public servant was designed to ensure that the traditional standards of integrity and conduct which are appropriate to the public service are maintained and that the interests of the community and the State, as owner of these bodies, are fully taken into account in their operation.  Among the questions examined were, as I mentioned earlier, tendering for contracts, the monitoring of acquisitions and reporting and accountability.  The question of appointing civil servants to the boards of State bodies is also examined in the report. When they have completed their consideration of the report it is the intention of the Government to prepare and implement appropriate guidelines for State bodies based on their findings.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a brief word now on the specific issue of codes of conduct and disclosure of interest.  The public sector in Ireland has always had a high reputation for ethical behaviour and fair dealing.  In many cases decisions about what is ethical or fair are clearcut and will always remain so to any reasonable person.  In certain circumstances, <Col N="1220" /> however, an element of doubt or ambiguity may arise.  To help in these situations and to protect both the organisation and the individual, it is desirable to have a written code of conduct. Such codes are, in fact, already in place in many organisations, both private and public.</P>
    <P>A very important element of such a code is disclosure of interest.  This is a necessary protection if decisions are being taken at the board of a company or among senior management.  It is also a safeguard for the person involved in protecting his good name and bona fides. When it is standard procedure it normally gives rise to very little difficulty.</P>
    <P>The report of the Secretary of the Department of Finance on guidelines for State bodies, which I mentioned, addresses the question of disclosure of interest and makes certain recommendations in the matter.  While these are still under consideration by Government, and I would not wish to anticipate their findings, I can state at this stage that the recommendations are in no way at variance with the proposals in this regard contained in the revised Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>In a democracy such as ours, Government exists to serve the people.  Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that the citizen should be granted reasonable access to the records of their Government.  The Government's attitude in this regard was clearly outlined by the Taoiseach in his address to the last Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis:</P>
    <P>A truly open society is one whose citizens have access to as much information as possible on the way they are governed, consistent with the right of individuals to privacy and the ability of the Government to function effectively in sensitive areas such as security, foreign affairs, taxation, and budgetary policy &mdash; as well as in day-to-day administration.  The Government are considering the provision of greater freedom of information and the reform of present official secrecy provisions. <Col N="1221" /> Freedom of information legislation would of course require a fairly fundamental change in the working habits of public administration and necessarily will take time.  All aspects of such legislation must be examined, in the light of the experience of the limited number of countries, where it is already in operation.</P>
    <P>The existing law on official secrecy is almost 30 years old.  It has served the country well in most respects.  The Government are, however, concerned that, in its provisions dealing with &ldquo;authorised disclosures&rdquo;, the current legislation is unnecessarily biased towards the withholding of official records and does not accord sufficient rights to the citizen to be informed of the workings of Government.</P>
    <P>Change in the area of freedom of information will represent one of the most farreaching reforms of our system of public administration since the foundation of the State.  Once legislation is enacted, official files, save in a few particularly sensitive areas, will be freely accessible to the general public.  One of the trends with which Government Departments have been faced in recent years is ensuring that their communications to the public are concise and intelligible.  While this applies to the internal communications within a Government Department, or between Government Departments, officials are entitled to assume that when they write or the Ministers, whom they brief, have a familiarity with relevant legal and bureaucratic phraseology.  If it was necessary to ensure that such communication was to be as readily intelligible to any concerned citizen who wished under freedom of information to read the file, the impact of the change would be such as to be revolutionary. How far public servants can move in this direction without sacrificing efficiency and speed in administration will be a very interesting test in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to reform in the area of official secrecy.  This does not mean that we are prepared to <Col N="1222" /> be pressurised by any individual or group into precipitate action.  The experience of other countries in this matter underlines the necessity for detailed research and consideration on the part of Government before publishing any draft legislation. In the United States, legislation in this area was first enacted in 1966; subsequent experience there gave rise to the need for further legislation in the area to remedy the perceived inadequacies of the 1966 Act.  In Australia, a Freedom of Information Act was passed in 1982; this was amended somewhat by subsequent legislation.  As the Taoiseach indicated, the area of freedom of information is very complex.  It might be helpful if I outline briefly some of the areas which will require particularly sensitive handling.</P>
    <P>While we endorse the private citizen's right to access, we must also ensure that such access would never diminish the equal right of the citizen to ensure that his properly private dealings with Government remain private and do not come into the public domain.  We, in this State, must be particularly vigilant to ensure that any right of access to official information can never enhance the ability of undemocratic, subversive or other criminal groups to take on the forces of law and order.  In the commercial sphere, it would be intolerable if new found access to official files could enable an individual or company to steal a march on a business rival.  Finally, we must not fool ourselves that reform of this nature will not give rise to significant costs in terms of the processing of applications for disclosure of documents and the inevitable disruption of work involved.  The Government do not regard the cost factor as a reason for inaction in this area. However, the current state of the public finances would not allow us to ignore the cost dimension in deciding on the precise form which freedom of information should take.  I mention these problems not to suggest any weakening of our commitment to reform but rather to underline the necessity for care and thoughtfulness in the drafting of the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>Phrases like &ldquo;official secrecy&rdquo; conjure <Col N="1223" /> up visions of a state in which those who govern and those who serve them directly carry out their functions in isolation from the community they were appointed to serve.  It is important to keep a sense of perspective about this.  We in this State always have been able to take it for granted that our Governments are answerable to Dáil Éireann; that individual Members of the Dáil can question Ministers about their actions and those of their civil servants.  These are, and must remain, the bedrock of a democratic society.  In recent years we have built on these foundations a new openness &mdash; by arranging to have Dáil and Seanad sessions broadcast on radio and television; by expanding and making more public the meetings of committees of these Houses at which civil servants are called on to explain official actions; by setting up an Ombudsman with full access to official files; and by getting Government Departments and offices &mdash; particularly those which have regular dealings with large numbers of citizens &mdash; to produce information booklets or establish information offices and by training civil servants at all levels to become more informative and user friendly.  If areas of darkness remain in our public administration they attract attention because of the degree to which the administrative process generally has increasingly been brought out into the light.  This Government's approach to the issue of freedom of information is designed to ensure that the light of public scrutiny reaches even those darkened corners.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Gay Mitchell endeavoured to explain in detail the justification for Deputy John Bruton tabling the motion before the House, having listened to some of the difficulties and problems; above all, having listened to my explanation of the actions taken by this Government in recent times and those proposed to be taken under the Programme for Government, I am quite certain that tomorrow evening Deputy Mitchell will entice his colleagues not to vote in favour of it.</P>

      <P>Obviously the amendment is properly before the House.  The point at issue is that I have never come across the practice &mdash; and admittedly, I have not been in this House very long &mdash; of a Minister proposing an amendment and making a speech without making any reference whatsoever to that amendment. I have now received a copy of the amendment from the Clerk.  It is a measure of the ill-preparedeness of this Government to address this issue that, despite adequate notice in terms of the issue having been on the agenda for a very long time, a detailed amendment was not argued on the floor of the House <Col N="1225" /> this evening by the Minister of State responding on behalf of the Government. In fact, I would have to say that the Minister's response was very disjointed. It appears to be the work of three different word processors and typescripts, and neither began nor ended with any logic or coherency.  That is unfortunate in addressing an issue as fundamental as this.</P>
      <P>It is not as if this issue had parachuted out of the sky this evening.  I have a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> addressing this issue. People might properly ask if we had discussed this issue before.  I thought we had made progress on this issue because most Members were present when we debated a Bill some months ago, a night of great tension, Members might recall, one on which the full Cabinet were present to hear the conclusion of that debate.</P>
      <P>Let me recall the history of this issue for the House and the Minister of State because it becomes quite frustrating for somebody, particularly from this side of the House, who seeks to achieve to put into legislation or into rules of this House something that by common consensus is agreed in principle.  We appear to have an inability to put those principles into effect.  Unfortunately I have come to the conclusion that that inability to legislate or to implement rules and regulations stems from a fundamental reluctance to have those rules applied to ourselves in this House.</P>
      <P>This issue was first put on the agenda in a letter to the Ceann Comhairle by the Leader of the Labour Party on 19 October 1989.  In that letter the Leader outlined draft regulations on a declaration of Members' interests, and other matters, and sought that regulations would be enacted into the rules of this House. There was no response in terms of progress so I, as Labour Whip, wrote to the clerk of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and sought to have the matter listed for debate by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals involved a requirement that, upon election, every Member of this House should declare his or her interests and the financial affairs of his <Col N="1226" /> or her spouse to preclude the possibility of a conflict of interest.  If legislation which would impact on a business or on a sector of the economy were before the House and a Member had an interest in the company by way of being a shareholder, a director or adviser to that company, the House and the public would be aware of it.  There was to be a public register with general access.  It was a four or five page document which sought to bring this Parliament into line with the majority of parliaments in Europe and in the developed world by providing for transparency in the way we do our business.  That is hardly a revolutionary proposition but the response of the committee was to bury it.  It was referred first for discussion by the party Whips but got nowhere.  When I raised it again it was referred to the parliamentary parties but, again, got nowhere.  All this was designed by both major parties to take the matter off the agenda.</P>
    <P>So seriously did the Labour Party regard this issue that, since we could not enact it by way of regulation because of the blocking tactics of the two major parties at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, we decided to do so by way of legislation.  We published the Ethics in Government and Public Office Bill, 1991 on 26 February of this year.  It was a more comprehensive statement. We felt that the principles set out in our original motion should be broadened and put into legislative form.</P>
    <P>The contents of that Bill are well known.  There were three fundamental principles.  The first was the requirement of a register of Members' interests.  We wanted that enshrined in legislation.  The second and third principles were new. One related to the receipt of gifts by Members.  We required that Ministers of State and the Attorney General should have to surrender gifts of a value of greater than £200.  The third principle enshrined in that Bill was fundamental to the conduct of public life, namely, transparency in relation to the funding of political parties.  We sought the disclosure of all moneys received by every registered political party and sought to <Col N="1227" /> exclude the possibility of any individual or company subscribing more than £1,000 to any political party in any given year. We believe they are fundamental principles which would bring a level of respectability to public life which has been sorely eroded in recent times.</P>
    <P>It was like King Robert Bruce of Scotland trying again, having been struck down on umpteen occasions, when we brought that Bill before the House in Private Members' time on 7 May this year.  On that auspicious night, what was the response of the then Minister for Finance to those principled proposals which sought to have a measure of transparency in public life and high office?  In the shadow of the debate that very day in relation to the beef industry inquiry, the then Minister for Finance responded that he did not feel it should be dealt with by way of legislation.  He said it should be dealt with in the context of House rules and procedures rather than on a statutory basis.  When we had proposed it by way of regulation, it was buried in a private committee where there was no public scrutiny and no members of the Press present.  When we brought the proposal to the floor of the House we were told the issues were too complex to deal with in legislation and that it should be provided for in the rules of the House. The then Minister had the good grace to admit that the Labour Party had gone down the road he had suggested, but unfortunately he did not admit that the efforts of the Labour Party to effect the changes had been frustrated by his party on several occasions.</P>
    <P>That debate was rather truncated because we had the interruption of a long debate on the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry.  The second Government speaker was the Minister of State who is present this evening.  Before he spoke my colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, in response to the reluctance of the Minister for Finance to accept the legislation, made a proposal on behalf of the Labour Party.  In his speech on 14 May he said the Labour Party were prepared to withdraw their <Col N="1228" /> Bill and not to force it to a vote if there was general agreement in the House that gifts to senior office holders, together with the issue of Members' financial interests, should be referred for consideration to a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that the sub-committee should be representative of every group in the House, that it should meet in public session like any other informal sub-committee and that the Minister for Finance should agree to commence discussions immediately with representatives of other political parties on the issue of the funding of parties, with a view to drawing up guidelines which ultimately might be encompassed in legislation.</P>
    <P>They were the proposals my colleague put to the Minister of State.  Predictably, the offer was rejected.  Instead the Minister of State, Deputy Vincent Brady, suggested that the whole issue be referred back to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  He invited that committee to undertake a detailed examination of the issues involved.  We were on the merry-go-round again.  It was a very interesting night when we offered to build, in whatever way the Government and the majority of this House wanted, the fundamental principles of accountability and transparency in public office and public life into rules or legislation by way of consensus.  We were fobbed off again. The Minister of State wants to refer them back again to the committee they established 18 months before that.</P>

      <P>There is no question but that we are being obstructed in our desire to have these principles enacted by the Government side.</P>
      <P>When the division bells rang on 14 May last the Bill proposed by me on behalf of the Labour Party was defeated by two votes.  Unfortunately, it was defeated with the support of the Progressive Democrats who had, we thought, some commitment &mdash; indeed they expressed this privately to many Members of the House, including me &mdash; to the principles enshrined in that Bill. However, the Progressive Democrats on that fateful day had already fired their one shot and demanded that the Government set up an inquiry into the beef industry.  They could not be macho twice in the same day so, unfortunately, they had to back down on that issue.  They virtually apologised to the House and individuals for their inability to support the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State informed us tonight that there is now a new mood in the Government parties, that the knocking of heads which occurred before the confidence vote a couple of weeks ago has brought about a change of view and that the principles we wanted enshrined in legislative form last May and in rule form 18 months before will be enacted by the Government who want it all of a sudden because it has been agreed in the Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to deal specifically with the motion before us.  The Minister of State singled out two specific issues.  He spoke about a register of Members' interests. I fundamentally feel that a register of Members' interests should be by way of statute and not regulation.  The Minister put forward a proposal tonight in regard to a register of Members' interests about which we are supposed to cheer.  He said that, as to the register of Members' interests, he was afraid that the motion seemed to betray total ignorance of the contents of the recently published Programme for Government.  He went on to <Col N="1230" /> say that the Programme for Government stated that a register of Members' material interests would be established from September 1992 &mdash; should the Government survive &mdash; and would be available in the Oireachtas Library.  Why would any person want a declaration of Members' interests postponed for another year unless it enabled some people to offload interests or change their circumstances? I do not understand the logic behind postponing that fundamental issue for another 12 months.</P>
    <P>I want to make a very interesting comment on the funding of political parties. I make this point by way of defence of the Fine Gael Party.  On the question of the public funding of political parties, the Minister of State said that once again the main Opposition party had attempted to link this question with the general issue of ethical standards in public life.  To be frank, the issue of the funding of political parties was first raised by the second speaker in the debate on the Ethics in Government Bill.  I never mentioned this issue when I proposed the Bill.  It was not in any section of the Bill.  It was the then Minister for Finance who dealt with it at great length in his contribution to the Bill &mdash; he was the second contributor to the debate before any Fine Gael Member spoke&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Many speakers commented on this issue subsequently.  On a radio programme the following morning the chairman of the Progressive Democrats had his tuppence worth to say on it but it had nothing to do with the Bill.  If it is being described as a red herring it was raised by the Minister for Finance. It may be that, because he was charged with the financial running of his party as well as the country at that time, he introduced it.  It is very disingenuous of the Minister of State to suggest tonight that once again the main political party have attempted to make that linkage.  It was one of the first issues the Minister referred to in his speech on 7 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State also said tonight <Col N="1231" /> that neither are the Government prepared to defer action on improving standards in public life while the funding of political parties is properly considered. There is a certain cheek in the statement that the Government are not prepared to allow the issue of accountability and the registration of Members' interests to be put on the long finger by linking them with the funding of political parties. They initially made the link.</P>

      <P>For 18 months they have repeatedly obstructed the principle of establishing a register of Members' interests.  I am afraid their hypocrisy on this matter is very transparent.</P>
      <P>I hope we will stop going on the merry-go-round on this issue once and for all and that the parties in Government will accept the motion before the House.  I have many criticisms of the motion but, as I appealed in May for support from all sides of the House for the principles in the Ethics in Government Bill, I am willing to accept the principles on behalf of the Labour Party enshrined in the motion before us.  We should stop talking around the issue, finally address it and put into place the sort of safeguards, transparencies and accountability which are the norm and are commonplace in every other respectable Parliament in the world.</P>
      <P>I welcome the motion.  However, I regret that it will not have a statutory base.  This is unfortunate.  We have come a long way and I thought a legislative measure would be clearly binding on Members and ensure that people who default or people who are less than forthright in their declarations would be accountable to the laws of the land and the enforcement agencies of the law the same as every other citizen.  That would have been an improvement.  If I had my way I would prefer the issue to be dealt with by way of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to establish a parliamentary ethics commission is an interesting one.  As I said, the Labour <Col N="1232" /> Party do not think this would be the ideal vehicle because there are issues which have to be addressed in relation to the separation of powers and the rights of this House.  I have long believed that we have denigrated ourselves in this House. We have allowed the Judiciary and other outside agencies to impact on the affairs and workings of this House.  This is a sovereign Parliament of this Republic. We are elected by the general public in universal franchise to represent their interests here.  We have not vindicated that right effectively in recent times.</P>
    <P>The whole methodology on which legislation is enacted denigrates individual Members of this House.  It is agreed in Government, unless you have the goodwill of the Minister, substantial or significant changes will not be agreed on the floor of the House.  Unless the Minister is well disposed towards change, Government backbenches or Opposition Deputies will have no impact on legislative proposals.  In terms of reform we have a long way to go.  I am not sure that the proposition to have a commission of the kind described is the correct way to proceed.  The Labour Party will vote on this issue because of the principle involved, and it is on the principles I hope all Members will decide the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to talk about State funding of political parties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Aung San Suu Kyi is 45 years old and the daughter of a hero of the Burmese independence struggle against British colonial rule and Japanese occupation. Her father was assassinated in 1947.  She married Michael Aris, a British <Col N="1233" /> academic, and has two sons.</P>
    <P>She returned to Burma &mdash; now called the Union of Myanmar &mdash; to nurse her dying mother and while she was there became involved in political affairs when the man who had ruled Burma from 1962 announced he was resigning and that a referendum would be held to decide on the political future of the country. However, his party refused to agree to a referendum and political turmoil ensued.</P>
    <P>Later that year the army staged a coup but they also promised free elections.  Suu Kyi formed a political party with some of her supporters and called it The National League for Democracy &mdash; NLD.  It was a non-violent organisation with strong proposals on human rights.</P>
    <P>On 20 July 1989 Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest.  Her husband tried to visit his wife and two sons but was allowed to do so only under the same terms of house arrest as she was under. He returned to England to bring his two sons back to school and that was the last time she was allowed to see her sons whose Burmese passports have been declared invalid.  This was an obvious ploy to get her to leave the country also. He husband was allowed to visit her for two weeks for Christmas 1989 and that is the last time he saw her.</P>
    <P>On 27 May 1990 the election took place and the National League for Democracy won 392 of the 485 seats contested or over 80 per cent of the vote, this despite the fact that she had not been able to canvass and was held under house arrest for ten months before the election.</P>
    <P>The last letter her family had from her was in July of last year and every attempt to regain contact has failed.  It is understood that she has recently been on hunger strike and that she is ill but there is no solid information about this.</P>
    <P>Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize this year and has been refused permission to collect it.  The UN Commission on Human Rights Special Rapporteur, Mr. Yokota, was in Burma in September of this year and asked to be allowed to visit her.  His request was refused.</P>
    <P>A lengthy letter to us from the <Col N="1234" /> Ambassador for the Union of Myanmar to Germany said in effect that they are committed to an orderly transfer to democracy, that they resent &ldquo;excessively emotional and one-sided&rdquo; foreign interference in their internal affairs, that they believe human rights to be of fundamental importance &ldquo;provided it is distinct from external political ambitions and if it is not used as a means to champion the sectarian interests of certain groups or individuals within a country&rdquo;. In my view he is clearly using the fact that she married an Englishman and her sons are half English as a weapon against her.  He claims that there are no political prisoners in Myanmar, that a new government cannot be installed before a new constitution is agreed and that terrorist groups are active necessitating such emergency legislation as exists.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party asks the Irish Government to call on the Government of Burma/Myanmar to release the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, from house arrest; to release all other non-violent political activists and dissidents at present under detention and to restore civil and political liberties.  We also call on the Government of Burma/ Myanmar to allow immediate access to Aung San Suu Kyi by a doctor and an international humanitarian organisation, such as the Red Cross or Amnesty International.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Irish Government make direct representations and not simply incorporate their representations under EC representations or, indeed, United Nations representations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say how grateful I am to Deputy De Rossa for giving me the opportunity to speak on this matter.  I join him in his condemnation of the Burmese authorities' refusal to allow Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi to travel to Oslo to receive the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The award focused once again international attention on the appalling situation in Burma.  In welcoming the <Col N="1235" /> award, the Government, in common with our European Community partners, expressed the hope that it would lead the Burmese military regime finally to recognise the isolation it has brought upon its country and the aversion felt by the international community at the continued incommunicado detention of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.</P>
    <P>We deplore the fact that all access to the outside world is denied her, including contact with her political supporters, with her family and with the media, and that all requests by foreign visitors as well as by European Community representatives in Rangoon to be allowed to see her have been refused by the military regime.</P>
    <P>It is profoundly disturbing that, since the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Burmese authorities have down played the award and have ensured that, in addition to being unable to travel to collect the prize, she has not been permitted to receive messages of congratulations personally from the Norwegian Peace Prize Committee and from foreign Governments.  It has been put to her by the authorities that she is free to leave Burma and go into exile.  Were she to accept this condition, she would thereby forfeit her right to return to Burma.  She has, quite justifiably, rejected this &ldquo;offer&rdquo; or, as Deputy De Rossa said the &ldquo;ploy&rdquo;.  Such a condition can only be regarded as an infringement of the internationally recognised right of an individual to leave and return to his or her own country &mdash; as enshrined in Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>There have been various reports to the effect that the Burmese authorities have prevented attempts in recent weeks by members of the international community to see her and to reassure themselves as to her personal safety and wellbeing. Chief among these was the refusal of a visa to the Norwegian Ambassador resident in Singapore to travel to Burma to convey the official announcement of the award to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.  In addition, a United Nations Human Rights Commission team which was in <Col N="1236" /> Rangoon at the beginning of November was refused permission to contact her.  In response, and as a mark of his personal concern, the UN Secretary-General issued an appeal on 6 November that she be freed from house arrest and that her family be allowed to visit her.</P>
    <P>There have also been reports, as noted by Deputy De Rossa, that she is on hunger strike and that her physical condition has deteriorated as a consequence.  Given the circumstances of incommunicado detention under which she is held, it is impossible in this, as in other respects, to obtain reliable information.  Like others in this House, I find these reports extremely disturbing and my concerns are not relieved by the assurances of the military regime &mdash; unsupported by independent sources &mdash; that she is in good health.</P>
    <P>The situation in Burma, both in relation to human rights abuses and the failure of the military junta to respect the results of the May 1990 elections, continues to be a matter of the gravest concern to the Government.</P>
    <P>Together with our partners in the Community, and on a number of occasions over the past year, we have expressed our deep concern at the continuing failure of the Burmese military authorities to respect the democratically expressed wish of the Burmese people.  In addition, the situation in Burma has led the Community and its member states to suspend non-humanitarian development aid programmes and reduce economic and trade relations to a minimum.</P>
    <P>At the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in February, the Twelve expressed their grave concern at the deterioration in the human rights situation in Burma and noted the inclusion of Burma in a report on torture compiled by the Commission's Special Rapporteur.  At the same time, an urgent appeal was made by the Twelve to the Burmese rulers to transfer power without delay to the victors in the 1990 elections.</P>
    <P>The Twelve's continuing concern has been reflected in further statements issued in May and July and, again most recently, in the statements delivered by the Presidency on behalf of the Twelve <Col N="1237" /> at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on 24 September.</P>
    <P>In their May statement, the Community and its member states condemned the numerous shortcomings in respect of internationally accepted rules of conduct and of human rights, the continuing harassment, detention and house arrest of opposition leaders, prominent among whom is Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, and the refusal to free political prisoners.</P>
    <P>Appalled that the Burmese authorities continue to spend large amounts of their country's meagre resources on arms, the Twelve announced on 29 July their decision to refuse the sale of any military equipment from Community countries to Burma.  They called on the rest of the international community to show similar restraint and desist from all such sales.</P>
    <P>In their statement to the United Nations General Assembly in September, the Community and its member states once again called on the Burmese regime to respect the mandate laid down by the Burmese people in May 1990 and to introduce a democratic multi-party system.  The Community indicated its willingness to re-establish constructive relations with Burma, including a resumption of development assistance programmes, once Burma fulfils its obligations in the field of human rights and democracy.</P>
    <P>Both we and our partners in the Community continue to take a grave view of the situation in Burma, both as regards the personal case of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and the deplorable human rights situation in general.  We are examining with our Community partners and with others on how best, including at the United Nations, to put further pressure on the military regime to release her and all other political prisoners and to hand over power to those democratically elected in the May 1990 elections.  I can assure Deputy De Rossa that his comments will be taken into account by the Government.</P>

      <P>The announced closure of the Western Digital plant at Dublin Hill, Cork, is another hammer blow to the morale of the north side of Cork city which has suffered so many setbacks in recent years.  It will affect an area that has been devastated by unemployment reaching in excess of 70 per cent of the population in some parts of the area.  The news will wreck many dreams, ambitions and hopes of the 300 people affected.</P>
      <P>The news which broke last week was overshadowed somewhat in the media by the dramatic events within Fianna Fáil up to Sunday and then by the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil play-acting on Monday.  I have spoken to many of the workforce who feel betrayed and let down as they feel that the minds of their political leaders, the decision makers, were preoccupied with power struggles and political intrigue while, at the same time, their jobs and lives were being destroyed.</P>
      <P>My purpose here this evening is not to get involved in any political mudslinging but it is my responsibility to raise this very serious issue here in the House and to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to outline in detail what steps he has taken in recent weeks to avert the tragic closure of Western Digital.  I ask the Minister to outline what has happened to date and what he proposes to do in the next number of hours and days to avert the imminent closure of Western Digital at the end of this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not speak this evening about retraining or placement of the employees in other industries.  We have heard that so often in the past when other industries closed in the Cork area. Many of the victims of previous closures <Col N="1239" /> are still on the unemployment scrapheap.</P>
    <P>What is required is a bringing together once again of the employment task force which was set up in Cork in the early eighties shortly after big industrial closures at that time.  I ask the Minister to immediately intervene with the company in order to get a solution to this catastrophe and to set up the employment task force.</P>
    <P>Again this evening I lament the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta which could have been a vehicle to save the Western Digital plant.  I am not sure what would have happened if they were in existence but I ask the Minister to give the full facts this evening not for our sake but for the sake of the victims of this most recent tragic event.  The Minister and the decision-makers should get down to real action and avoid much more play-acting.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this important debate. Some 414 jobs have gone from Western Digital since last June.  My worst fears have been realised.  A first-class highly skilled young workforce is now redundant. The Minister should ensure that the necessary action is taken to counteract the serious unemployment problem in Cork city particularly on the north side of Cork city.  Western Digital had first-class labour relations between unions and management.  The Minister should intevene to ensure that agreements already there will be honoured by the new company when they take over and, more importantly, the Minister should do everything in his power through the IDA to make sure that Cork city is given priority because there is now chronic unemployment in Cork city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, is at an engagement this evening and has asked me to take this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Western Digital (Ireland) Limited was established in Cork in 1983 by Western <Col N="1240" /> Digital Corporation of California, USA. The company manufactures printed circuit boards for use in disk drive controllers for personal computers.  The Irish company performed very well and employment grew steadily.  By the beginning of this year, employees numbered approximately 400 permanent staff.  In addition, 150 temporary staff had work at the plant.</P>
    <P>Western Digital began to run into problems because their principal product line was surpassed by more advanced technology.  The company have had to let employees go, and current employment stands at 270 permanent and 70 temporary employees.  I have been informed that because of their current difficulties Western Digital (Ireland) Limited would cease operations.  Already, Western Digital's plant at Irvine, Scotland, closed in August, 1991, with the loss of 110 jobs.</P>
    <P>While the provision of alternative sources of employment is a matter for the day-to-day responsibility of the Industrial Development Authority and is not something in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has any direct function, nevertheless the Minister is anxious to ensure that all possible steps are taken to minimise the impact of the closure on the workforce and on the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>The company, with IDA assistance, are making arrangements to ensure that a minimum of damage is caused by their withdrawal.  A buyer has been found for the Western Digital plant.  A New York based company, Dover Electronics, has signed a letter of intent to purchase the company and the new operation will provide initial employment for 100 people. Dover Electronics is part of the $2.4 billion Dover Corporation, a worldwide company occupying leading positions in the elevator, resources, electronics, packaging and assembly automation, sub-contract assembly and technology markets, and employs over 20,000 people worldwide.  Dover's acquisition of the Cork facility should allow them to address new opportunities in the European market and will provide new opportunities for the Cork plant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1241" /> The Western Digital plant in Cork represents a state of the art facility, employing advanced manufacturing technologies such as surface mount printed board stuffing.  Its employees have a reputation as a highly motivated, quality workforce.  In addition, the potential of the plant is further enhanced by its proximity to the National Microelectronics Research Centre.  I am confident that in a plant of this calibre, with the commitment of the new owners and the assistance of the Industrial Development Authority, the new operation will act as a springboard for future success which will, I hope, result in more jobs becoming available in the future.</P>
    <P>In addition, Western Digital Ireland is to make professional independent assistance available in job search, in personal financial planning and, where applicable, pension fund planning to all employees. I am confident that, given the calibre of the workforce, and the assistance of the company, alternative employment can be found for most in a short period.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am satisfied that all possible steps have been taken to minimise the negative impact of the closure of Western Digital.  All parties concerned, in particular the company and the IDA, are working to ensure this, and their efforts have already resulted in a buyer for the plant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Sudden infant death is one of the most devastating tragedies that can befall parents.  It happens to approximately 160 Irish families a year, that is, three per week.  Sudden infant death is where a small, apparently healthy baby is found dead with no reason for the death.  It is a mysterious killer.  No one knows how or why it happens but the heartbreak it causes is indescribable. Sometimes that grief becomes public as when TV Star Anne Diamond lost her four month old baby son during the summer.  Last weekend she spoke bravely about her loss at the conference of the <Col N="1242" /> Irish Sudden Infant Death Association in Dublin.</P>
      <P>During that conference an important research finding was made public.  For the first time evidence was produced that something can be done to reduce the risk of cot death.  In New Zealand and in Holland researchers found that, where the practice of sleeping babies on their tummies was changed to sleeping them on their backs or on their sides, the cot death rate dropped by almost a half.  Nobody knows exactly why this has happened and no casual link has been established, but it is thought to be related to overheating. If babies become overwarm they are less likely to be able to lose the excess heat when lying on their tummies.</P>
      <P>With such compelling evidence available it is important that the information be made available to all parents, and quickly through RTE programmes.  Last weekend RTE made an effort on one of their programmes to put out this information. They concentrated on the findings and will have done a good public information job for those people who saw it. However, that is not good enough.  Many people were concentrating on other things last weekend.  I want the Minister to give an undertaking that he will finance a proper information programme for parents through maternity hospitals, through GPs, through health centres and, particularly on the media, to make sure that the message gets through clearly.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sudden Infant Death Association puts out the clear message that babies should not sleep on their tummies but on their backs or on their sides.  The four point plan also suggests that babies should not be allowed to become too warm, that the mother should not smoke during pregnancy, that smoking should not be allowed near the baby during the first year of life and that breast feeding for the first few weeks should be encouraged not because this reduces the risk of cot death but because it may reduce the risk of infection.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will see the importance of these findings, particularly as the cost to the Department would be minimal and the gains considerable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since taking office I have had a particular interest in research into the causes of sudden infant death, and have been anxious to assist in any way possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon decided earlier this year to allocate funds towards the cost of establishing a national register of cot deaths for a period of three years.  The register is being put in place by the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association and will form a valuable data base for research into the incidence and causes of the problem.</P>
      <P>A grant of £24,500 from national lottery funds was made to the association in May.  The Minister has committed further grants of £23,000 in both 1992 and 1993 for the register.  I should mention also that the Health Research Board has assisted research projects in this area; it made grants totalling £35,000 in 1989 and 1990 for research at the Rotunda Hospital into the pathology of the placenta associated with sudden infant death syndrome.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sudden Infant Death Association wrote to the Minister on 8 November 1991 asking about the position of the Department of Health in relation to the guidelines which have been used in New Zealand since 1987.  These are: sleeping a baby on his or her back or side; not allowing the baby to become too warm; not smoking during pregnancy and not allowing anyone to smoke near the baby during the first year of life; breastfeeding for the first few weeks, not because this in itself reduces the risk of cot death, but because it may reduce the risk of infection.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health received that Irish Sudden Infant Death Association letter on Friday last, 8 November 1991 and has asked the Faculty of Paediatrics of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland for its views on the New Zealand guidelines before deciding on the nature of the information in relation to the prevention of cot death that must be promoted by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Minister for Health has <Col N="1244" /> emphasised with vigour the risks associated with smoking for the general population and has pursued a range of measures in the legislative, educational and research areas both here and in Europe.  In the case of pregnant women the risks involved with smoking are well documented.  It has always been a feature of the Department's health promotion unit's anti-tobacco strategy that special emphasis should be placed on pregnant women and smoking.  Recently, as part of that strategy a joint Health Promotion Unit/Council for the Status for Women campaign aimed exclusively at women was launched.  A major part of that campaign concentrated on the risks to the unborn child of a mother smoking.  The council actively promoted this campaign nationally.  The question of an approach to passive smoking generally and specifically when near young babies will be taken into account in developing an antismoking strategy in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health provides comprehensive information for mothers on breast feeding.  A detailed publication <i>Food and Babies</i> is published by the unit and is available free of charge through all maternity units, health boards and direct from the public office of the unit.  This publication provides extensive information on breast feeding which is, in fact, currently being updated by the unit in consultation with relevant professional expertise.  Another publication on child development entitled <i>The Book of the Child</i> also contains information on breast feeding.  This publication is also available free of charge from the outlets mentioned above.</P>
    <P>Also, as part of its support programme for voluntary organisations in the health promotion area, the health promotion unit has provided finiancial assistance towards the educational/information activities of La Leche League over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The level of funding and support for the important work of a voluntary organisation reflects my commitment and that of the Minister to the area of sudden <Col N="1245" /> infant death.  In addition, its Health Promotion Unit provided approximately £6,000 to the association for the dissemination of information to its members.</P>

      <P>The issue I want to raise is accessibility for people with a disability to the taxi service.</P>
      <P>The pitiful degree to which public facilities are accessible to people with a disability is a matter of shame. People with a disability are literally left on the side of the road.  They cannot get into many of our public buildings.  They cannot board any of our bus fleet and can rarely get a taxi that can accommodate them.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most telling testimony of all is that this House itself is not accessible to people with a disability because of the various obstacles in the way.  Equally, most of our polling stations are inaccessible. That is a testimony to the lack of attention given to the needs of people with a disability when framing policy.</P>
      <P>Even their needs as voters and as possible Members of the House are not considered. We are systematically closing off opportunities for persons with a disability to take part in community life in a proper fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few weeks the Government once again decided that the needs of those with a disability must wait still longer.  They have issued an order under which an extra 100 taxi plates will be made available in Dublin but they are not making it a requirement that any single one of them be wheelchair accessible or accessible to people with severe disability. This is a downright disgrace and shame on us as able-bodied politicians. It is not too late to change the decision as none of the plates has yet been issued. I suggest that 25 of the new plates be <Col N="1246" /> set aside for persons who are willing to provide wheelchair accessibile vehicles to be used by those with severe disability.  I accept that this would pose problems for some taxi owners but in relation to this quota the Government should agree to waive a substantial part of the proposed £3,000 licence fee for adapted vehicles. I would ask the Minister of State to consider this suggestion sympathetically.</P>

      <P>Meeting the needs of people with disabilities was always seen as an important part of the review of the law relating to the operation of small public service vehicles. The question of wheelchair accessible taxis has been considered by the interdepartmental committee set up to study the law in this area but it was not found possible to provide for the introduction of suitable vehicles in the interim measures announced on 25 October 1991.</P>
      <P>Those measures, particularly the decision to authorise the granting of 100 new licences, were designed to secure an immediate improvement in the level of service provided by taxis in the extended Dublin taxi-meter area.  There is a very limited range of vehicles available which would be suitable for use by wheelchairs even with adaptations.  It is not a simple matter of adapting standard saloon cars which make up the taxi fleet in this country.</P>
      <P>The problem of fixing a specification for a wheelchair accessible taxi is currently being addressed and recommendations in relation to the provision of such vehicles are expected to be included in the final report of the interdepartmental committee.  That report is expected in March 1992.  I can assure the Deputy that I will bear his remarks in mind.</P>

      <P>The north Sligo water supply augmentation scheme was submitted to the Department of the Environment by Sligo County Council in 1986. Since then the water supply for the area has continued to deteriorate but there has been no action on the part of the Department and nothing has been done about it.</P>
      <P>The original north Sligo water scheme, dating from 1960, was designed to bring a water supply to the village of Grange. Since then it has been greatly extended, mainly through group schemes.  It now supplies areas such as Cliffoney, Mullaghmore, Maugherow, Carney, Lissadel and Gortarowey.  The water supply is totally inadequate to meet the demand.  The capacity was designed for 220,000 gallons a day but the need is for roughly twice that amount.  Those simple figures are the easiest way to demonstrate the water crisis that exists.  Many of the houses and the areas are without water for long periods on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Unlike most other parts of the country, the population of north Sligo is, fortunately, growing.  Many planning permissions for houses have to be turned down simply because no new connections to the water supply can be granted.  This is an extremely popular tourist area with greatly increased demands on the water supply during the tourism season. Development in this industry is also greatly curtailed because of the water supply limitations.  The same goes for farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the augmentation scheme is not excessive.  It will cost something in the region of £1.2 million.  An excellent new source of water supply is available. All documentation is with the Minister and the scheme is the number one priority of Sligo County Council.  All that is needed is approval and funding from the Minister.  I hope he will quickly notify Sligo County Council of both.  I also hope that tomorrow the excellent service given <Col N="1248" /> by the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, at the Department of the Environment will be rewarded with him being given a top job.  If so, I hope he will give immediate attention to the north Sligo water supply augmentation scheme.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Nealon for his kind remarks and I am pleased he has brought this matter to our attention. In 1990 a grant under the small water and sewerage schemes programme was allocated to upgrade the treatment plant and improve water quality at the north Sligo regional water supply augmentation scheme.  I am aware there are still some difficulties with the current supply in the north Sligo area and that further works are desirable.  However, having regard to the level of commitments and the number of high priority schemes competing for the limited capital funds available it is not possible to say when the scheme will be approved to go to tender and construction stage.  In the light of what the Deputy has said I will keep the matter in mind and see what I will be able to do to help when funds become available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about what is happening in our hospitals right across the country.  The health boards and hospitals are closing wards for the rest of the year in an effort to stay within their budgets with the result there will be substantial reductions in admissions for scheduled operations.  I am aware that in some cases such admissions have come to a virtual standstill.  Let me take the Mid-Western Health Board as an example to illustrate this point and I have no doubt my colleagues from the west and north-west could cite many others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They plan to cut our 10,500 in-patient days during the second half of this year with the result that waiting lists in one of the smallest health board areas will be increased by at least 2,000 people. Recently the Minister had to come into the House to announce that the average waiting time for admission to a public <Col N="1249" /> hospital for a routine hip replacement operation in this health board area was two years to two and a half years.  The same is true in the case of every other health board.  As the Minister is aware, the new accident and emergency rota has led to Dublin hospitals being plunged into chaos.  As a recent report to the Minister points out, hospitals in Dublin are providing a full-time emergency service. Many departments are now reporting that admissions for scheduled operations are at a standstill while the waiting lists for Dublin hospitals, which stood at 15,000 at the end of the summer, are now substantially higher.  The real tragedy is that this foolish measure will not lead to a red cent being saved, rather it may cost the Department money.</P>
    <P>Since the Dáil resumed I have been persistently asking how many people are on the waiting lists and how long people will have to wait but the Minister has consistently been either unwilling or unable to answer my questions in the Dáil.  That is disgraceful and is an indication of the way in which the Department of Health is being run.  The Department are being run with blinkers and a blindfold on.  The Minister has spent the whole year burying his head in the sand and has refused to face reality. Instead of providing care for those waiting on public lists he has extended entitlement to those who have never asked for it and, when the budget went completely off the rails earlier this summer, he introduced ill-thought out cuts.  The consequences will be felt in the run-up to Christmas when patients will get an inferior service.  As you are aware, a Cheann Comhairle, the south east will not be exempt.</P>

      <P>The question relates to elective admissions to hospitals, particularly in the Dublin area where, Deputy Bruton states, the new accident and emergency rota has aggravated the problem.  I intend therefore, to confine my remarks to this issue rather than deal with other health board areas at this time.  I would like first to <Col N="1250" /> explain that the revised rota for hospital accident and emergency services is confined to Dublin.  There is no rota arrangement for hospitals elsewhere in the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health recently received a report on the operation of the Dublin accident and emergency service since the introduction of the revised rota on 2 September 1991.  This shows that, in the first six weeks following the introduction of the new arrangements, the overall level of elective admissions to the major Dublin hospitals has not changed significantly.  In fact, it has risen somewhat, from a pre-September average of 576 admissions per week to a new weekly average of 611 after the introduction of the new arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the Mater Hospital as an example, elective admissions for the six weeks subsequent to 2 September 1991 averaged 141 per week, as compared with an average of 101 per week prior to the changeover and a figure of 129 for the best week in the first eight months of the year.  Increased use of day surgery at the Mater Hospital since mid-August has contributed to a more effective use of beds.  Hospitals may find it necessary from time to time to cancel elective admissions in cases where beds have been allocated to emergency admissions. However, as I have indicated, the overall level of elective admissions has been maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the accident and emergency service is closely monitored by a steering group, comprising the accident and emergency consultants from the six hospitals concerned, together with their hospital managers/chief executives and chaired by the acting programme manager, general hospital care, Eastern Health Board.  My Department receive regular reports from this group on the operation of the service and hope the <Col N="1251" /> Minister for Health will meet the Dublin hospitals involved shortly to discuss the operation of the new rota arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the inability of the Southern Health Board to pay their creditors on time and the disclosure that the health board can owe up to £7 million at any given time to their suppliers.  This problem is bringing about the possibility of company failures and job losses in the suppliers' companies.  The Southern Health Board so far this year have a deficit of £2.9 million and they have been warned by the Minister that they must not overrun their budget this year; otherwise they will suffer the consequences next year.</P>
      <P>To keep their deficit to £2.9 million this year the health board have had to embark on laying off the equivalent of 150 persons.  There will be that many job losses in the Southern Health Board during the remainder of this year and 130 beds are closing in the Cork Regional Hospital for a prolonged period over Christmas.  The sum owed to suppliers can vary from £4.5 million to £7 million. I know that the Minister will say that, according to the time of the month, the sum can be less than the figure I quoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the Minister warned the health board not to over-spend.  What will they do?  They have already closed wards. Must they close more wards?  Must they stop operating altogether to achieve the targets of the Minister?  The Minister has lost control of the health services and, with tomorrow's events in mind, he should take the opportunity to throw in the towel because he has lost control and the people are suffering.  He has devastated the services.  Another dangerous trend is that he has sent six chief executive officers of the health boards in the last couple of days to look at the privatisation process in Guy's Hospital.  Is that the Minister's solution to the crisis in our health services at present?  The <Col N="1252" /> Minister, in his brief response, should tell the Southern Health Board how they can meet the demands of the people they are supposed to serve and the requirements of many companies giving so much employment.  I refer to the companies supplying the health board with equipment.</P>

I most certainly could not agree with his comments that there is something wrong in sending officials from the Department of Health &mdash; or indeed from the health boards &mdash; to visit other areas to look at the finer points of their health systems, to bring them back and to incorporate them in our health system.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board receive cash from my Department on a weekly basis and in line with the cash profile established at the beginning of the year. This cash profile is directly linked with the level of approved expenditure for 1991.  Adjustments are made to the level of approved expenditure from time to time during the year, with a consequent increase in the level of cash.  Such increases to the approved expenditure level result from approved pay increases, cash allowances and other service-related items.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department are in touch with the Southern Health Board, and with health boards generally, on a weekly basis to determine cash requirements, including the need to meet a board's special requirements, within the level of the overall cash profile agreed. Indeed, my Department give every possible assistance to each agency on this matter, having regard to the approved expenditure limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> However, on the basis of this arrangement it is the responsibility of each health board to manage their cash and credit in line with their operational needs and approved expenditure levels.  The timing of payments to suppliers of goods and services is entirely a matter for the board management to decide.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that where a board incurs expenditure in excess of the approved level it is inevitable their credit strategy will come under pressure, as approved bank overdraft limits cannot be exceeded.  In this regard, I must emphasise that the cash which is transferred to health boards is tailored, together with the approved level of bank overdraft, to match the approved level of non-capital expenditure.  This level of expenditure is geared to enable boards, including the Southern Health Board, to deliver the approved 1990 service levels in 1991.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health recently met the chief executive officers of health boards to emphasise the vital importance of achieving agreed service targets within the budgetary limits.  Any expenditure excess arising in 1991 will be a charge against the 1992 allocation.</P>

      <P>The boarding out allowance scheme is a very efficient, cheap and caring form of accommodation for the elderly.  It is a substitute in the majority of cases, for keeping people in welfare homes or hospitals for geriatrics. It started in the Western Health Board area and operates very well.  The principle is that elderly people are integrated with families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited many of the houses in question and can testify to the level of service being provided.  Unfortunately, it is being provided literally on a shoestring; for £25 per week, just over £3 per day from the health board, plus half the pensioner's pension &mdash; in other words £53 in total. These ladies provide excellent, humane and top quality service.  I brought the <Col N="1254" /> matter to the attention of the House on 11 June and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Connolly, assured the House that an increase of £3 was envisged in relation to the recipient of a social welfare pension. I also got the impression that there was a further increase implied.</P>
    <P>The ladies in question are literally at the end of their tether and, unless they get a reasonably substantial acknowledgment of the work they put in, are threatening to pull out of the scheme.  They have banded together in a very efficient unit and are determined that they will bring home very forcefully to all and sundry the merits of their case.  I urge the Minister to retain this service and not to have it scuppered for the sake of a hap'orth of tar.  For a few pounds these ladies could continue their good work; not alone could we retain the existing service, we could enhance and expand it. I urge the Minister to be munificent and give the necessary money to the health boards to enable the service to be retained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, regulations are being drafted to cover boarding out arrangements, under section 10 (2) of the Health (Nursing Home) Act, 1990.  The regulations will govern the standards of accommodation, care and welfare of people being boarded out; the amount of the contribution to the costs involved by the health board; provide for inspections and interviews with the persons being boarded out; and provide for the numbers to be accommodated in any household. These regulations will harmonise the approach by the various health boards to the option of boarding out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations will also provide that the grant payable by a health board in respect of each person being boarded out shall be increased to a sum not exceeding half the maximum single rate of non-contributory old age pension.  At new 1991 rates this would amount to £27.50 per week.  Further increases will occur in line with increases in the social welfare rates.  As stated previously, this grant is in addition to the agreed sum paid by the <Col N="1255" /> elderly person to the householder which is generally also set at half the rate of old age pension.  This means that there has already been an increase this year.  In effect there will be an increased income to the householder every time there is a revision in the rates of old age pension. This matter was dealt with in an Adjournment debate on 11 June last and it was made clear that an increase would ensue when the new regulations were introduced. Discussions on these with interested parties are at an advanced <Col N="1256" /> stage and the regulations should be ready for signature early in the new year.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins that this is an excellent scheme and, obviously, we are all anxious that it should continue to prosper.  I hope the new regulations, which will be coming into force at the earliest opportunity in the new year, will add to the strenghtening of this excellent service.</P>

      <P>Under the self-assessment system the self-employed were due to pay their preliminary tax by 1 November 1991. Approximately 208,000 notices of preliminary tax for income tax for 1991/92 were issued by the Revenue Commissioners to the self-employed in early September 1991.  As part of a campaign to improve compliance a postcard was issued around mid-October to the self-employed. This postcard reminded them of their obligations under the self-assessment system.  As in other years an extensive advertising campaign was mounted tp promote the timely payment of preliminary tax.</P>
      <P>Due to an error, demand notices issued prematurely on 16 October 1991, to some 2,500 taxpayers.

      <P>Contrary to the Deputy's view, there has been no softening of budgetary targets. On the contrary, the Government's commitment to these targets has been reaffirmed. I would draw the Deputy's attention to the text of the reviewed programme, which states:</P>
      <P>in order to sustain economic growth and to increase employment, the Government's medium-term budget targets must be resolutely adhered to. There can be no deviation from the budget discipline which has been central to the economic progress of recent years.  Continued reduction of the national debt ratio towards 100 per cent of GNP by 1993 is essential.  To this end, the EBR will not exceed 1.5 per cent of GNP by 1993.</P>
      <P>Consistent with that parameter, and notwithstanding the adverse effects on current revenue and expenditure of the unfavourable international economic climate in 1991 and 1992, the aim must remain of achieving broad balance, within the limit of 1 per cent of GNP, on the current budget by 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a restatement of the objectives set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in relation to the debt/GNP ratio and the current budget, together with the setting of a specific target for the EBR in 1993.  The targets represents in fact a firming of the budgetary objectives agreed in 1989.  In the more difficult economic climate that has emerged, they reflect the Government's determination to adhere to strict fiscal <Col N="1028" /> disciplines underlying the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>I consider it to be highly desirable that Ministers should be accountable to Dáil Éireann in the matters mentioned, and this is, in fact, the case, either by way of parliamentary questions, legislation, or debate.  There are appropriate reporting mechanisms in place to ensure that Ministers have access to relevant information in relation to State-sponsored bodies.

    <P>The review of the Programme for Government states that the Government are committed as a matter of urgency to a number of relevant steps.  Legislation will be introduced, which will include provisions to apply to State bodies, to regulate business standards.  Persons proposed for appointment to boards of all State agencies and companies will be required to make a declaration of any interests relevant to their membership of such bodies.  An appropriate code of <Col N="1029" /> conduct will be required for employees in each State company, together with an adequate system of internal audit.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have recently received from the Secretary of my Department a report, prepared at my request, on the principles which should govern the relationship between Departments of State and the State bodies under their aegis, together with subsidiary and associated companies of the bodies in question.</P>

      <P>There is no unique economic growth rate which would permit the implementation of the various <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> measures affecting the budget while at the same time, enabling the overriding fiscal objective of lowering the national debt/GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by end-1933 to be achieved.  Much would depend on the source or composition of any given growth rate.  Growth can be tax and employment intensive to varying degrees, depending in particular on its composition as between consumption, investment, stockbuilding and exports. In addition, the necessary rate of growth would clearly be a function of other developments affecting the fiscal balance, both matters within Government control, for example the degree to which measures not impinging on <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitments were taken, and matters outside Government control, for example unemployment costs arising from altered migration patterns essentially prompted by external developments.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Finance Act, 1986 provides for repayment, after the end of the tax year, of deposit interest retention tax deducted from incapacitated persons and persons aged 65 years or over, to the extent that they would not otherwise be liable to tax on the relevant interest.  These are the only two classes of individuals who are entitled to a refund of DIRT and I do not accept that there is a need to exempt them when they can reclaim the tax.  These arrangements have remained unchanged since DIRT was introduced in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, at present, there are no outstanding claims for the repayment of DIRT.  Indeed, they have gone to some length to try to accommodate those entitled to refunds.  They have run advertising campaigns to inform taxpayers of the availability of refunds.  In addition, each year, a refund form is automatically <Col N="1032" /> sent to all those over 65.  I am satisfied that these arrangements are working smoothly and keeping delays to a minimum.</P>
    <P>However, if the Deputy is aware of any specific cases that are causing problems perhaps he could supply some details to my officials or to officials of the Revenue Commissioners who could then investigate and report to me if ther is a genuine problem.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that there are a number of investment options to which retention tax does not apply, such as credit union interest, and the interest and bonus payments on the small savers schemes operated by An Post &mdash; savings bonds, savings certificates and national instalment savings.  In addition, the retention tax rate, which is the same as the standard rate of income tax, has been reduced from 35 per cent when the tax was introduced in 1986 to 29 per cent for this current tax year.  It is the Government's intention to reduce this rate further over the next two budgets.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The black economy, of its very nature, is an area of economic activity which seeks to avoid official attention and recording.  Reliable estimates of its turnover are not, therefore, available for any of the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to request an update <Col N="1033" /> of the Central Bank document referred to in the question.  It is well known that the various approaches used to measure the black economy provide answers which are subject to wide margins of error and hence are not useful for policy purposes.</P>
    <P>Rather than seeking to measure the black economy &mdash; an unproductive exercise in the circumstances I have outlined &mdash; the Government are tackling the problem of concealed economic activity through measures to counteract tax evasion and social welfare fraud.  These measures have proved successful and it is intended to continue with them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 43 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy in this matter is that stated in the Programme for Government, namely that any changes in the ownership structure of particular State companies will only take place if it is in the public interest and in the best interest of the company and their employees and following consultation with the social partners.  This policy is reiterated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>It was agreed on 27 March 1990, at a meeting with ICTU, that a working group under the Central Review Committee would undertake a speedy review of the role and contribution of State companies in economic development and in job creation.  The working group agreed a number of principles.  These include agreement that there could be sales of shares in a State company to the private sector where this will enable the company to survive, to make a better contribution to the economy, to protect or increase employment, or is desirable on policy grounds.  The Government stated that they have no ideological position on this. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> states that the Government accept these principles.  That remains the position.</P>
      <P>There are no specific proposals before the Government at present for the disposal of all or part of the State's shareholding in any State-owned companies, other than the sale of B &amp; I which is nearing completion.</P>

    <P>* Includes withholding tax on professional fees from 1987 onwards.</P>
    <P>In considering the table, it should be borne in mind that the PAYE sector accounts for the vast majority of taxpayers. Also, the increase in yield shown for Schedule D taxpayers other than farmers in 1987 and 1988, excluding the amnesty, reflects the fact that the withholding tax on professional fees was introduced in 1987 and extended in 1988, and that the 1989 yield from such taxpayers was the first to reflect a full year's credit for withholding tax paid in the previous year.  Attention is also drawn to the following notes to the table:</P>
    <P>(1)  The figures cover more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries. They include tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income. They also include the tax paid under <Col N="1037" /> PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>(2) Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown are, to some extent, estimated.  The figures shown are estimates of the tax paid by full-time farmers together with tax paid by trader-farmers on their farming profits only.</P>
    <P>(3) This includes tax paid on income from trades and professions &mdash; other than farming &mdash; together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income.  The figures also include relatively small amounts of tax resulting from direct assessments under Schedule E on employees.  This is collected with tax from the self-employed and is not separately identified. It also includes withholding tax on professional fees.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Unimogs are classified for customs purposes as motor vehicles for the transport of goods.  This classification is standard throughout the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For excise purposes, most commercial vehicles are liable at a rate of 6.5 per cent.  Agricultural tractors are, however, exempt from this duty.  It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to determine which vehicles qualify for the exemption and, in this regard, they have decided that Unimogs do not come within the agricultural tractor classification. Therefore, they are liable at the rate <Col N="1038" /> applicable to commercial vehicles, that is 6.5 per cent.  The UK does not apply any duty on commercial vehicles, generally, but budgetary constraints in Ireland necessitate that the excise duty here be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that Deputy Stagg is referring to the figures published in tables 37 and 38 of the Statistical Report of the Revenue Commissioners for 1990 which show, <i>inter alia</i>, that the number of cases with total income in excess of £25,000 which were assessed to tax under Schedule D for the income tax year 1988-89 was 5,105, or 4 per cent of the total.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the figures in question are some considerable number of years out of date.  Because Schedule D cases were, at the time to which the figures relate, taxed on the basis of previous year's income, the figures appertain to income arising in accounting years ending in the year up to 5 April 1988.  In most cases of businesses, this relates to earnings in the calendar year 1987.  The self-employed are now taxed on a current year basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other important qualifications. The technical income definition used in the relevant tables of the report does not fully reflect a taxpayer's basic income since it allows for deductions in respect of such items as capital allowances, interest paid in full and retirement <Col N="1040" /> annuities.  Moreover, the published figures do not include proprietary directors of incorporated family businesses who are akin to the self-employed but are taxed under PAYE.  If these factors are taken into account the proportion of the total number of self-employed taxpayers with gross incomes in excess of £25,000 for the 1988-89 tax year came to 16,000, or 9 per cent of the total.  For the same tax year, the equivalent proportion for PAYE taxpayers was 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the proportion of self-employed taxpayers, including proprietary directors, with gross incomes above £25,000 for the 1991-92 tax year will be some 28,000 or 14 per cent of the total compared with a corresponding figure of 8 per cent in respect of PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that not all the self-employed have large incomes; there would be a large proportion of individuals in this class with low incomes e.g. smaller farmers, small shopkeepers, low investment incomes and so on.</P>
    <P>The phased development of the new self assessment system involved initially the encouragement of voluntary compliance by taxpayers.  This has been very successful with returns now being filed by over 90 per cent of taxpayers.  An integral part of the development of the new system is, of course, the audit programme under which taxpayers' returns and accounts are examined to ensure proper declaration of income and deductions. The audit phase got under way last year when some 35 inspectors were assigned to audit work following special training. This number will have risen to 100 by the end of 1991 and to 160 by the end of 1992.  This switch of resources to audits should enable a rate of audit in this area of about 1.5 per cent of the taxpayer base to be achieved in 1991 and up to 2 per cent in later years &mdash; a level more than comparable to that in other self assessment jurisdictions.  This is apart altogether from the very large number of audits which have as their primary focus VAT and PAYE compliance, of which there were some 22,000 carried out in 1990.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> For the most part, audits are not initiated at random but rather are targeted on the basis of perceived defects in tax returns or supporting accounts.  The additional amounts of tax being collected as a result of audits are a reflection of the careful selection of target cases.  I recognise however that random audits, under which every taxpayer has a possibility of being selected for audit, are essential, because such audits encourage compliance by increasing the perceived possibility of an audit.  I understand that a higher proportion of cases to be selected for audit in 1992 will be chosen on a random basis.</P>
    <P>Because of their concern to ensure that all sectors of the community pay their fair share of tax, the Government have since 1987, in addition to the introduction of the self assessment system, introduced significant other changes in the direct tax code which are designed to: improve collection and recovery of tax due; release resources away from the routine surveillance of compliant taxpayers to programmes designed to deal with noncompliers; and increase the resources specifically applied to countering tax evasion and avoidance.</P>
    <P>These changes have been facilitated by the introduction of a wide range of collection and enforcement measures which include: withholding tax on professional fees; extension of tax clearance procedures for public sector contracts; improvements in the Sheriff system; the power to attach assets of tax defaulters; and a new collection initiative, for which I made available £1 million in the 1991 budget, which facilitates, amongst other things, rapid pursuit of interest due on late payment of tax bills and more intensive monitoring of bigger cases.</P>
    <P>All these measures are contributing to better collection and enforcement of tax obligations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Spring I should add that as well as the general measures which I have outlined, a specific programme to review tax arrears which had not been discharged under the 1988 tax amnesty was launched soon after the effects of the <Col N="1042" /> amnesty were analysed.  The objectives of that programme were to agree or finalise the amount of liability, determine the most appropriate form of enforcement for collectible arrears and confirm any circumstances which would suggest that the arrears might be uncollectible, such as where businesses were defunct or where a taxpayer's whereabouts were unknown.  The programme involved: extended co-operation between the tax assessment and collection arms of Revenue, and, direct personal contact with the taxpayer or taxpayer's agent.</P>
    <P>The extra resources provided in the 1991 budget have enabled Revenue to build on and develop the original postamnesty review of arrears.  Since its inception in 1989 some £165 million of entrenched arrears has been collected under this programme.</P>
    <P>The effects of all these measures will be kept under review and I will not hesitate to take whatever further action may be needed to ensure that all sections of the community pay a fair share of tax.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The Government are anxious to ensure the ongoing viability of the national lottery so as to safeguard this important source of funding for the many socially desirable programmes which are now assisted by the national lottery.</P>
      <P>Occasional large jackpots are popular with players.  They help to sustain public interest in the lotto and encourage additional players to participate.  They thus help to ensure its on-going success.</P>
      <P>To put a &ldquo;cap&rdquo; on the size of lotto jackpots would, I feel, run the risk of undermining public interest in participation and could well jeopardise the long term success of the game.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to issue a direction to An Post National Lottery Company to change the prize structure of the lotto.</P>
      <P>In general the use of lottery moneys is confined to domestic programmes. However, I would remind the House that we have used lottery moneys for disaster relief in the past &mdash; such as for the earth-quake in Armenia &mdash; and earlier this year the Government directed that £600,000 of lottery funds be allocated to the Department of Foreign Affairs for disaster relief in addition to the £1 million of Exchequer moneys already allocated for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The issue of the level of Ireland's Official Development Assistance is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  However, I might mention that the Government have contributed some £45 million in 1991 on Overseas Development Assistance; an increase of 25 per cent on the 1990 allocation.</P>

      <P>Our policy is to sustain a strong currency within the European Monetary System and to implement whatever monetary and other measures are necessary to that end.  As the Irish pound is in the narrow band of the EMS, it cannot deviate by more than 2.25 per cent from the Deutschemark and other currencies in that band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our strong exchange rate policy has been a major factor in the reduction of inflation, the attraction of direct foreign investment and the creation of conditions <Col N="1046" /> which allow Irish industry to compete for markets abroad.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that pegging the Irish pound to the Deutschemark would of itself eliminate this remaining interest rate differential.  The level of interest rates is not determined solely by exchange rate policy.  The market also takes into account a number of other factors including the general economic environment and the size and liquidity of the market.  Reflecting our greatly improved economic circumstances the differential between key Irish and German money market interest rates has fallen from over 9 per cent in March 1987 to less than 1 per cent at present.</P>
    <P>As a small open economy, the generation of economic growth and employment opportunities is dependent on the competitiveness of Irish business and economic conditions in foreign markets. Our present policy of a firm exchange rate policy and fiscal adjustment has contributed to the improvement in competitiveness. There is no evidence that any further benefit maybe derived from pegging the pound to the Deutschemark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question No. 52, in so far as it relates to taxation issues, and Question No. 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork Freeport already enjoys a broad range of indirect tax reliefs, in the areas of VAT and of customs duties.  VAT at point of entry is not charged on goods entering the designated area of the Freeport which are destined either for the home market or for re-export.  There is also VAT-free importation for materials and components used in processing or the manufacture of goods, for machinery and plant used in connection with such processing or manufacture, and for equipment brought into the Freeport for repair and servicing.  In addition, goods supplied within the Freeport by one VAT-registered person to another, and <Col N="1052" /> similar supplies from the Freeport to Shannon, are zero-rated for VAT purposes. Goods from outside the European community are also exempt from Customs duties for as long as the goods remain within the Freeport.</P>
    <P>Where incentives in the area of direct tax are concerned, I have already outlined the position in the reply given to Deputy Quinn on 14 March last.  The Freeport Advisory Committee had made representations seeking to have the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax extended to certain trading operations in the Freeport. Since then, it has been explained to representatives of the committee that specific EC approval would be required for such a concession and that there are clear indications that this would not be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>All in all, I consider that the range of available reliefs is generous.  I might add that in relation to any other proposed direct tax incentives, it is not apparent how these could necessarily guarantee the creation of new jobs at no cost to the Exchequer, especially given the EC's attitude to the provision of State aids.</P>
    <P>In so far as Deputy Allen's question relates to non-tax matters concerning the Freeport, such as marketing, promotion or grant aid, these might be addressed to the relevant Ministers concerned.</P>

      <P>Originally, the EC Commission proposed that duty-free shopping facilities for intra-Community travellers be terminated from end-1992 on the grounds that their continued operation was incompatible with the completed Single Market when customs checks relating to taxation will be abolished.  However, at yesterday's ECOFIN Council meeting in Brussels, it was agreed that member states would have the option of retaining such facilities until 1 July 1999.  It is considered that the extension period agreed represents a reasonable compromise between all the interests involved and gives adequate time for the retailing outlets to make the necessary adjustments. The Commission have promised to bring forward shortly guidelines for Community control arrangements to ensure effective policing of duty-free outlets after customs checks have been withdrawn.</P>

      <Quest>if the proposed restructuring of employee PRSI to consolidate it into a simple main rate of close to 6 per cent as stated in the Review of the Programme for Government 1989-1993, paragraph 7, page 5 will involve the elimination of the health and employment levies; if the commitment in the same paragraph of the review to more progressive employee PRSI codes will involve the elimination of income ceilings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 56 and 77 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment in the <i>Review of the <Col N="1054" /> Programme for Government</i> refers to the restructuring of the main PRSI employees rate only.  This relates to those employees currently paying a combined rate of PRSI, including levies, amounting to 7.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposed new rate of &ldquo;close to 6 per cent&rdquo; it is intended to retain the component elements of the current rate, that is, the health contribution, employment training levy and the social insurance contribution.  The question as to how the rate reduction is to be funded, including the question of the income ceiling, will be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.  In addition, any consequential or other changes in the structure of the social insurance contribution system are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, in the first instance and for Government consideration in the budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debt/GNP ratio is a function of many possible variables in addition to the growth rate of the economy.  For example, the level of borrowing, interest and exchange rates and redemptions would all affect the ratio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear, either, what the Deputy has in mind when he calls for the estimated ratio in 1992 and 1993 to be calculated on the basis of &ldquo;neutral budgets&rdquo;, nor how the specified growth rates are to be translated into budgetary terms.  Tax revenue buoyancy is dependent on such factors as consumption patterns which can vary very significantly for any given growth rate.  Similarly, the shift in migration patterns reflected in the live register, and therfore in social welfare <Col N="1055" /> spending this year, bears no relationship to the domestic economic performance.</P>
    <P>It follows that any prediction of the evolution of the debt/GNP ratio based solely on growth rates would be likely to be misleading, and would not justify the allocation of Departmental resources that would be needed to prepare it.</P>
    <P>The medium-term target, as already announced, is to reduce the debt/GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993.  I can assure the Deputy that despite the difficult budgetary situation, the debt/GNP ratio is set to fall yet again this year, and that the Government are committed to ensuring continued progress in 1992 towards this essential objective.</P>

      <P>The semi-State companies operating under my aegis are the Industrial Credit Corporation and the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Industrial Credit Corporation, codes of the type described for board members and employees are applied.  It is a matter for the corporation itself to apply the codes, and the corporation would bring any irregularities to the attention of the Department.  An <Col N="1056" /> official of my Department sits on the board of the ICC.</P>
    <P>The code covers guidelines to business conduct, which are issued to all staff and includes as conflicts of interest, confidentiality, personal financial transactions, outside employment, fees, gifts, public appearances and publishing of articles, and political activities.</P>
    <P>A declaration is signed by all members of staff covering secrecy, disclosure, prejudice of the company, observation of rules of the company, frauds, stock exchange speculation and engagement by the company.  Guidelines to board members include disclosure of interests, borrowing, holding of shares and advice to the secretary of other offers of appointment. Each director must sign a declaration of secrecy.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the company do not have a formal comprehensive, written code of conduct for directors and staff.  The corporation, however, expect high standards of ethical behaviour from directors and employees and tight internal control procedures are designed to monitor compliance with these standards.  Board members are required to declare in writing any possible conflicts of interest that might arise in connection with their position as directors.  If a conflict should arise, they will be excluded from any deliberations on that item.</P>
    <P>Employees including management are prohibited from having any other gainful employment including directorships without the prior written approval of senior management.  Staff members must also sign a declaration of secrecy and give a written undertaking to bring any fraud or irregularity of which she/he may become aware to the attention of the board of directors or the secretary.</P>
    <P>Monitoring of the principles is a matter for the corporation itself.  However, an official of my Department sits on the board of ACC.  The corporation are currently examining the question of establishing a formal code of conduct.</P>
    <P>The secretary of my Department has prepared a report on the principles which <Col N="1057" /> govern the relationship between Departments of State and State bodies under their aegis.

      <P>The United Kingdom has not decided to remain outside the agreement on harmonised VAT rates reached by ECOFIN Council on 24 June last.  The UK disagrees with the method of implementing part of that package but not the package itself.  While eleven member states are of the opinion that a binding Council Directive is the most effective way to implement the agreement on the standard VAT rate, the UK contends that, when border controls are removed, market forces will be sufficient to ensure member states' compliance with the harmonised regime.  As the Deputy will be aware, the UK standard VAT rate of 17½ per cent already exceeds the minimum standard rate of 15 per cent agreed by Council.  The Irish standard rate is currently 21 per cent.</P>
      <P>I do not foresee any particular implications for our competitiveness as a result of the UK's stance.  In any event, legal texts giving effect to the earlier agreement remain to be discussed and adopted.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a joint working group comprising officers of my Department and of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is currently examining the scope for improving the format of the Appropriation Accounts and any consequent changes in the Estimates and Government financial procedures.  I understand that the group is likely to finalise its interim report in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The layout of departmental Estimates in the Estimates Volume has evolved over the years in response to the accounting and control requirements of Government accounting principles as derived from the Constitution, from statutory provisions and from the institutional and financial relationships between parliament and the executive.  The present layout fulfils the essential requirements of explaining to the Dáil how it is proposed to spend public moneys as well as forming the basis for the Appropriation Accounts which report on whether expenditure accords with the intentions of the Dáil.  The subheads of a Vote are also used by my Department as a basis for monitoring and controlling expenditure in the course of the year.  I am generally satisfied that the present layout <Col N="1059" /> of the Estimates volume meets these fundamental requirements which are of both traditional and on-going relevance.</P>
    <P>While the present format meets the requirements as to the regularity and propriety of public expenditure, wider modern financial management considerations such as timely information and efficiency and economy in the use of resources have to be borne in mind.  It is the duty of each accounting officer to satisfy himself that his Department have an appropriate financial management system that meets these wider needs of modern financial accounting and control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question arises out of the recently concluded <i>Review of the Programme for Government.</i> The review sets out the firm intention of the Government to endeavour to achieve the objectives of a standard income tax rate of 25 per cent with a single higher rate of 44 per cent.  Reduction of the standard rate to 25 per cent would cost an estimated £260 million in a full year, while introduction of a single higher rate of 44 per cent would cost an estimated £176 million.  Both of these figures are costed in 1992-93 terms and on the basis of there being no other change in the income tax code.  On this basis, introduction of these two tax rates in one step would cost an estimated £436 million in 1992-93 terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the programme also sets out the Government's commitment to restructuring employee PRSI (with the Health and Employment Levies) and to consolidate it into a single main rate close to 6 per cent.  A reduction of the employee main (Class A) PRSI rate by, say, one percentage point would cost an estimated £70 million in a full year in <Col N="1060" /> 1992-93 terms, assuming no other change in the PRSI structure.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the review states that the income tax objectives are to be implemented progressively from the proceeds of a parallel radical overhaul of the entire tax code and will be carried out on the basis of no net cost to the Exchequer, and that the restructuring of employee PRSI is to be implemented on an Exchequer-neutral basis.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to revise the method of allocation of EC Structural Fund aid as provided for in the Community Support Framework agreed with the EC Commission to cover the period 1989 to 1993. I have received no request from the EC Commission to carry out a revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that Ireland is treated as one region for the purposes of the EC Structural Fund Regulations. Accordingly, the Community Support Framework provides for the allocation of aid to sectoral programmes drawn up at national level by the relevant Ministers and departments, and approved by the EC Commission.  The Community Support Framework and supporting programmes were prepared following extensive consultation with sub-regional committees which were established by the Government to ensure that the needs and priorities of all areas would be given full consideration in the context of the National Development Plan which <Col N="1061" /> formed the basis of our application for Structural Fund aid.</P>
    <P>This process of consultation with sub-regional interests has been developed further through the establishement, under the Community Support Framework, of sub-regional review committees comprising representatives of local authorities, the social partners, Government Departments and the EC Commission. These review committees meet regularly to receive and consider progress reports and financial statements on progress in implementing the Structural Fund measures.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the sub-regional review committees are working effectively and the EC Commission is satisfied with these monitoring arrangements.</P>
    <P>The nature of the involvement of regional and community interests in drawing up submissions for the next round of the Structural Funds is being considered in the light of experience under the Community Support Framework and will be finalised in the light of general arrangements for the post 1993 Structural Fund programmes.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Deputy's question may relate to the power of attachment which was provided for in section 73 of the Finance Act, 1988.  Attachment is one of a number of enforcement options available to the Revenue where the taxpayer fails to comply on a voluntary basis. The legislation allows the Revenue Commissioners to attach amounts owed by a third party to a defaulting taxpayer.  The third party is directed to pay to the commissioners the amount of tax due from the defaulter.</P>
      <P>In advance of taking attachment action in a particular case, the taxpayer is formally notified in writing of the Revenue's intention to undertake enforcement action.  Specific reference is made in this notice to the power of attachment.  In the event that the taxpayer fails to respond to this demand with a reasonable proposal for payment of his-her liabilities the Revenue issues the notice of attachment to the relevant third party.  Simultaneously a copy of the notice of attachment is served upon the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction, the power of attachment has been invoked against a wide cross-section of occupational groups, including non-compliant farmers in relation to headage-premium payments and grants from the Department of Agriculture.  The above procedures as regards notice have been followed in all cases.</P>

      <P>The proposed overhaul of the entire tax code set out in the <i>Review of the Programme for Government</i> is to be undertaken in the context of the Government's firm intention to endeavour to achieve the objectives of a standard income tax rate of 25 per cent with a single higher rate of 44 per cent in the next two budgets, and in the course of those two budgets to begin working towards a considerable widening of the standard income tax band and increasing the personal allowances.  The question of which exemptions, shelters, allowances and concessionary tax rates should be curtailed is a matter for consideration by the Government in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that following investigations carried out by them evidence of the irregular use of Northern Ireland vehicles was uncovered.  These irregularities involved the hiring to tourists, for use in the State, of Northern Ireland registered vehicles temporarily imported without payment of import charges.  However, the irregular hirings appear to have been confined to the peak season and the number of vehicles involved is thought to have been relatively small.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am not prepared to tolerate a situation in which the bulk of Irish car-rental companies would be put at a competitive disadvantage by the improper actions of two or three such companies.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that car rental companies are now fully aware of their obligations and of the serious view taken of the irregularities in question. The Revenue Commissioners have also advised me that control arrangements are being reviewed to prevent a similar situation arising in 1992.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there has been a serious drop in population in the Connacht counties as revealed in the recent preliminary report on the 1991 census of population where, since 1986 the population of Roscommon has decreased by 5 per cent, the population of Mayo has decreased by 3.9 per cent and the population of Leitrim has decreased by 6.4 per cent; and in the light of this serious decline his views on whether the Government allocation of EC Structure Funds, which has resulted in little investment in these counties, requires reapproval.</Quest>

      <P>A total of £2.86 billion (1989 prices) was allocated to Ireland under the Community Support Framework for Ireland <Col N="1067" /> 1989-1993.  A further allocation of aid expected to be in the region of £165 million under the Community initiatives should bring our allocation to over £3 billion.</P>
      <P>The implemenation of the Community Support Framework is being effected through a series of sectoral operational programmes in the key development sectors. In drawing up the National Development Plan and negotiating the Community Support Framework the Government decided that our national economic and development priorities would best be served by the implementation of the sectoral operational programmes on a national basis.</P>
      <P>While no specific allocation of structural funding at sub-regional level was decided on in the context of the negotiation of the Community Support Framework, its implementation at sub-regional level is being monitored by seven sub-regional review committees comprising the social partners, Government Departments, EC Commission and the EIB.  I am happy that overall progress in implementing the Community Support Framework is broadly on target.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's contention that the implementation of the Community Support Framework has resulted in little investment in the west and north-west sub-regions.  The breakdown of Structural Expenditure at sub-regional level, placed in the Dáil Library on 16 September 1991, gives details of expenditure in each sub-region in actual terms for 1989 and 1990 and on a forecast basis for 1991 to 1993.  Total investment under the operational programmes over the five-year period will amount to £885 million in the west sub-region and £795 million in the north-west sub-region.</P>
      <P>Preparation for the post-1993 Community Support Framework will commence in earnest in 1992.  I can assure the House that all relevant considerations including the demographic changes referred to by the Deputy will be taken into account by the Government in this process.</P>

      <P>The proposed works at Crosshaven are included in my Department's fishery harbours development programme, which covers the period 1989-93.  This programme was submitted to the EC under the operational programme for rural development, which was approved last December.  Under the programme, Structural Fund assistance of £7.5 million is available for the development of fishery harbours in the period 1991-93.  The level of aid is 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>Pending the completion of a site investigation and survey work, it is not possible to say who will be charged with carrying out the physical work at Crosshaven pier or indeed when this work will commence.</P>

      <P>The Irish Government and the other governments in the European Community have consistently supported the Taif Accords which were adopted by the Lebanese Parliament in October 1989.  Those accords envisage the Lebanese state extending its authority over the entire Lebanese territory by means of its own internal forces.  The accords provide for Syrian troops to assist legitimate Lebanese forces to extend the state's authority.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that both Syrian and Israeli troops continue to be present in Lebanon but the Taif Accords have provided the framework for restoring greater stability in Lebanon than has existed for more than fifteen years.</P>
      <P>The European Council, at its meeting in Rome on 14-15 December 1990 expressed the hope that the Taif Accords would be fully implemented and so bring about the restoration of the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of a Lebanon free of all foreign troops.</P>
      <P>The Taif Accords affirm that Lebanon is a democratic parliamentary republic and provide that:</P>
      <P>Until such time as the Parliament has laid down an electoral Bill which is free from sectarian restraints, the parliamentary seats will be distributed along the following lines:</P>
      <P>(a) equal numbers for Christians and Muslims</P>
      <P>(b) proportionally among the sects of the two groups and</P>
      <P>(c) proportionally among the regions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> The European Council, in its declaration in December 1990, looked forward to the Taif Accords being fully implemented, thus enabling the Lebanese people to express their will through free elections.</P>

      <P>My direct responsibility for recruitment relates only to the Civil Service and there is no legislative barier to the employment of nationals of third countries in the Civil Service.  The Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, provides that the commissioners may make regulations confining the candidature for certain competitions to citizens of Ireland.  I am satisfied that, in practice, such provision is only made in competitions for posts which participate in the exercise of public authority.</P>

    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the target for the national debt was that &ldquo;the national debt/gross national product ratio will be stabilised in the course of the programme&rdquo;.  This target was very comfortably achieved over the period of the programme, with the national debt/GNP ratio falling from a peak of 131 per cent at the end of 1987 to an estimated 110 per cent by the end of 1990.</P>
    <P>The target in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is to &ldquo;reduce the national debt to GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993&rdquo;.  It is the Government's firm intention to achieve this target.  The EBR target of 1.5 per cent of GNP for 1993, published in the reviewed Programme for Government, is fully consistent with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> target for the debt/GNP ratio.</P>
    <P>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has been given statutory responsibility for the functions of Exchequer borrowing and managing the national debt including debt service.  The <Col N="1079" /> 1991 budget provision for debt service costs took account of a £40 million saving to be achieved by the agency.  I am pleased to note that not only will this saving be realised but significant additional debt service savings will also accrue in 1991.  I am confident that the debt management activities of the NTMA will continue to result in debt service savings in the future.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are acutely conscious of the need to provide to the business <Col N="1083" /> community the best possible VAT repayment service.</P>
      <P>The volume of telephone inquiries to the VAT repayment section has traditionally been very high.  While the response to telephone queries may appear to be poor, it should be noted that each query takes a long time to deal with because of the physical difficulty of determining what stage a claim has reached.  The claim moves within the office at each stage of the process.  If every member of staff were made available to answer telephones, the rate of processing would slow to an unacceptable level.</P>
      <P>Substantial improvements have been made in recent years.  The solution adopted was to set up a small unit to deal with inquiries, while concentrating on reducing the processing time of claims, so as to cut down on the number of telephone calls.  This approach has been quite successful. As the processing time has reduced (81 per cent are now dealt with within ten days), the volume of inquiries has fallen.  There is still scope for improvement, however.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives now in train are expected to lead to further reduction of the time taken to process claims during the course of 1992.  These initiatives should also lead to a reduction in the number of telephone inquiries.</P>
      <P>When an improved computer based claim monitoring system which is being developed becomes available in 1992 the Commissioners plan to install a telephone call queueing system to further enhance the telephone inquiry service provided.</P>
      <P>Certain cases will of course always require more detailed examination and will take longer to process.</P>

      <P>Growth in financial services in Ireland will be achieved primarily through the development of international financial activities, particularly through the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin.  In that respect, the extension, to the end of 1994, of the period during which new firms can establish in the centre and the approval for the continuation of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax until the end of the year 2005, as confirmed by the European Commission earlier this year, are important.</P>

In that connection, our programme of legislation is designed to enhance the type of product available to companies within the centre.  Ireland has been among the leaders in putting into effect recent EC directives concerning collective investment undertakings and life assurance.</P>
      <P>Last year the new unit trust and companies legislation came into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's Finance Act expanded uniformity of treatment to designated investment companies <i>vis-à-vis</i> similar <Col N="1085" /> investment vehicles such as units and unit trusts.</P>
    <P>The tax treatment of foreign life assurance in the IFSC has also been amended this year so that such companies will enjoy tax exemption in relation to the income of policy holders.  This income will now be taxed in the hands of the recipient as is the norm in continental European countries.</P>
    <P>I am confident, therefore, that we have created the right environment at the centre to attract companies and to encourage them to expand and develop. This will result in the growth of financial services in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a P21 form is a balancing statement of a taxpayer's liability in a particular tax year.  It is normally issued at the end of a tax year.  Although a P21 can issue if no further employment is likely to occur by the end of the tax year, this does not apply in the present case as the taxpayer's wife is still in employment.</P>
      <P>However, a claim for a refund of tax was made by the taxpayer and a cheque for £665.96 was issued to him on 4 November 1991.  This represents a refund of all tax deducted from him between 6 April 1991 and his cessation of employment on 17 May 1991.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>There has been no undue delay in payments under the ewe premium or beef premium schemes in counties Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow, Waterford and Westmeath nor has there been any general delay in making payments under the premium or headage schemes this year. Perhaps I should explain that payments are prepared in 25 district livestock offices around the country and transmitted to computer division for payment as soon as possible after inspection of herds and identity cards.  The introduction of a rota system to regulate either when a local office would send payments to computer division or when that division would make such payments would inevitably mean that payments would have to be held back purely to satisfy a rota requirement.  This would be totally unacceptable.  The present system whereby payments are made as soon as possible after inspection is by far the most equitable one and I do not intend to change it.</P>

      <P>Traditionally, Irish trade in live cattle has been primarily with Northern Ireland, the UK and Libya and I assume that it is the latter market to which the Deputy is referring.  In this regard, live cattle exports to Libya were suspended in May 1990 due to Libyan concerns over BSE.  Since then extensive consultations have taken place at ministerial and official level with the Libyan authorities.  In September 1990, I visited Libya with officials following which a Libyan delegation visited Ireland in late November 1990.  They indicated that they would make a favourable report to their authorities regarding the health status of cattle and beef.</P>
      <P>Developments have moved slowly since partly because of local Libyan difficulties in the animal health area. However, contacts between the Irish and Libyan authorities are continuing and I am hopeful that as a result the live cattle trade will resume shortly.</P>
      <P>In so far as the store trade itself is concerned prices for forward stores are at levels close to last year.  This is a reflection of the stability resulting from the revision to the arrangements for processors' margins for intervention beef which I negotiated last August.  There is obviously a wide variation in prices depending on quality with the good quality stores doing better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that store heifers and <Col N="1094" /> weanlings are making somewhat lower prices than last year.  In this context I was pleased to support the recent Commission proposal to increase the suckler cow premium this year by up to 20 ECU (£17.58).  I am satisfied that this move will improve confidence and provide important income support for producers.</P>

      <P>The IDA are the main <Col N="1095" /> executive agency with statutory responsibility for overseas industrial promotion. In addition to the availability of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing and certain internationally traded service industries, the IDA provide a range of financial and advisory supports to both new and existing overseas industry.  Financial incentives available include capital grants, employment grants, training grants and research and development grants.  The IDA have a selective approach to attracting foreign investment, targeting sectors producing sophisticated and high value products which offer the best growth potential to the economy.</P>
      <P>Payment of capital grants in the case of overseas projects is phased in relation to actual performance, usually job-related, and grant claw-back arrangements are included in the case of large upfront investment.  Other grant conditions may include the provision of a parent company guarantee and a grant matching condition which requires the company to match the IDA investment with equity. Such measures are basically designed to ensure that projects represent good value to the Irish taxpayer.</P>
      <P>A review of industrial policy is currently taking place and while this is intended to address particularly the internationally trading indigenous industrial sector, it will not be confined to this area. In advance of completion of the review, it is not possible to say whether changes in the incentives available to foreign industrialists will be necessary after January 1992.</P>

      <P>The requirement to take account of free board and lodgings has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants in different family and financial circumstances.</P>
      <P>The value of the benefit of free board and lodgings is assessed by reference to the net income of the people providing the free board and lodgings divided by the number of non-earning members of the household.  In establishing the value of free board and lodgings a disregard of up to £105 per week is allowed on the parental income.  This means that where the parents only source of income is a contributory old age pension the free board and lodgings assessment will be very low.</P>
      <P>Last July I introduced a minimum payment of unemployment assistance of £5.00 per week to those who would be entitled to less than this because of a high means assessment from board and lodgings.  Further improvements in this area will be considered as resources permit.</P>

Following an investigation by a social welfare officer a deciding officer assessed her with means of £40 per week from 28 November 1990 to 18 March 1991, based on the benefit of board and lodging enjoyed by her while residing in the family home.  Section 146 (1) (e) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended by section 13 (1) (e) of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, states that in calculating the means of a person claiming unemployment assistance the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by him/her shall be deemed to constitute the means of the person.</P>
      <P>Her claim was further considered from 19 March 1991, the date she ceased to live in the family home, and was disallowed as she failed to prove that her means did not exceed the statutory limit for receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>She appealed to the independent social welfare appeals office and her case was referred to an appeals officer for determination. On the basis of the evidence available the appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer in the matter.

      <P>The carer's allowance, which I introduced in 1990, provides an allowance for the first time direct to people caring for elderly and incapacitated pensioners. Eligibility for the allowance was extended to a much broader range of people than were catered for under the former prescribed relative allowance scheme and since July 1991 it has been extended to persons caring for recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
      <P>Carer's allowance may not be paid in addition to another social welfare payment. However, it has always been my Department's practice to advise recipients of a social welfare payment to claim an alternative payment where there is a possibility that they may be better off as a result.  Similarly, recipients are advised to retain their existing payment where this would be to their advantage.  The information leaflet on the carer's allowance clearly states that the new allowance may be paid instead of an existing payment provided the conditions are statisfied.</P>

      <P>In a number of larger hospitals, a specific qualified grade of pathology technician is employed.  The current scale applicable is in the range £10,758-£13,020 per annum.</P>
      <P>In Dublin Voluntary Hospitals, an allowance of £2.53 per post-mortem is paid where assistance at post-mortems is given by unqualified staff.  In other hospitals, a grade of mortuary attendant may be employed at a weekly salary in the range of £169.00-£179.67.  A number of post-mortems may be undertaken outside hours of normal rostered attendance in which case overtime payments would be applicable.  These arrangements apply in normal hospital post-mortem situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, in referring to State cases and decomposed corpses, may have in mind provisions in the Coroner's Act, 1962 which provide for payments by local <Col N="1113" /> authorities to lay persons assisting at post-mortems.  The remuneration arrangements under this Act fall within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>The drugs refund scheme, which provides for a refund of any expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of a specified amount over a prescribed period, was amended with effect from 1 August 1991.  Under the amended scheme the prescribed periods for expenditure are the quarterly periods commencing on 1 January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 October in each year.  A refund will be made in respect of any expenditure in excess of £90 over the course of any of these quarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would emphasise that the drugs refund scheme is one of a range of drug schemes which benefit the population as a whole.  In addition to this scheme, other <Col N="1115" /> drug schemes, designed to meet specific needs, are in operation as follows:</P>
    <P>Drug Cost Subsidisation Scheme &mdash; The continued operation of this scheme, which I introduced last year, ensures that persons who are certified as having a long term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for drugs and medicines in excess of £32 per month, are not required to pay more than £32 in any month for their drugs and medicines. They pay that amount to the pharmacist who claims the balance from the GMS (Payments) Board.</P>
    <P>Medical Card Scheme &mdash; Any person, who is deemed by the chief executive officer of a health board to be eligible for a medical card continues to receive all drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances without charge as heretofore. Over 1.2 million people (almost 35 per cent of the population) are covered in this way.</P>
    <P>Long Term Illness Scheme &mdash; Persons suffering from a specified long term illness obtain, without charge, drugs and medicines for the treatment of their condition.</P>
    <P>I will be closely monitoring the operation of all drugs schemes to ensure that particular hardship is not caused to any individual or family.  In this regard, I would stress that the chief executive officer of a health board is empowered to grant a medical card on gounds of hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>As a result of public concern over the increasing extent of solvent abuse, I included a section (section 74) in the Child Care Act, 1991, which makes it an offence to sell, offer, or make available, a substance to a person under 18 if it is known or if there is reasonable cause to believe that the substance or its vapours are likely to be inhaled by that person for the purpose of causing intoxication.  A person found guilty of such an offence is liable to a fine of up to £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment or to both.  I propose to bring these new legal controls into force on 1 December next.</P>
      <P>Because it is unlikely that the availability of abusable solvents and aerosols can be restricted completely, efforts must be made to inform parents, retailers, factories, garages and schools of the dangers associated with inhaling these products. An awareness campaign has been carried out by the health promotion unit of my Department which sought to do this. Pamphlets were circulated to retail outlets nationwide, and a booklet entitled &ldquo;Solvent Abuse &mdash; a guide for professionals and parents&rdquo; is available from the health promotion unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the unit continues to train <Col N="1118" /> groups such as teachers, women's groups (e.g. all youth officers in the Irish Country Women's Association) and public health nurses in the skills necessary to help young people resist peer pressure and other negative influences which lead them to experiment with and/or abuse different types of substances including solvents/aerosols.  I am not aware of any official report produced recently on the subject of solvent abuse.</P>
    <P>However, the health promotion unit, in conjunction with the National Youth Council of Ireland, held a one-day seminar on the subject of solvent abuse in March of this year and a report of this seminar was circulated to all who had attended.</P>
    <P>Invited participants were drawn from a range of disciplines including counsellors, youth workers, Outreach workers, juvenile liaison officers from all over the country, all of whom had contact with the problem of solvent abuse in their area of work.</P>
    <P>During the seminar the various types of abusable products and the locations where abuse occurs were identified and the dangers associated with abuse were highlighted.</P>
    <P>Recommendations were then made on what was needed to assist those who work with young people and to equip those young people with the self-esteem and decision-making skills to avoid the abuse of solvents.</P>
    <P>Acting on these recommendations the health promotion unit and the National Youth Council of Ireland are in the process of preparing resource materials on the subject of solvent abuse, similar to the Drink Awareness for Youth programme which is proving so effective in encouraging young people to be aware of dangers associated with alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>These new resource materials, which will be for use in youth groups or schools, will be available by early 1992 through the health promotion unit and the National Youth Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another initiative which will help fulfil a need identified at the seminar in March is the provision of a substance abuse prevention programme for schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> This programme helps young people to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to all drug offer situations and is at present being piloted in selected second level schools countrywide.  This programme has been jointly developed by the health promotion unit and the psychological service of the Department of Education, with assistance from Mater Dei Counselling Centre, and will run during the 1991-92 academic year.</P>
    <P>The substance abuse prevention programme involves the whole school staff, who receive training, resource materials and support from the project team in relation to areas such as assertiveness, influences on teenagers, self-esteem and decision-making skills in order to help young people refrain from abusing all drugs including solvents/aerosols.</P>
    <P>Following the successful piloting and evaluation of the programme the resource materials will be made available to all second level schools in the country.</P>

      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board are responsible for the provision of health services in South Tipperary.  St. Vincent's Hospital, Tipperary Town, was closed by the board in June 1987.  I understand that an annual saving of £390,000 accrued to the board as a result.  There were no additional costs incurred by the board in relocating staff and patients.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to compare the cost of treatment in acute and district hospitals as the treatment provided and length of stay are much different.  However, when St. Vincent's closed in 1987, the average cost per in-patient case was £1,281.66 compared to an average cost of £742.52 per in-patient case in acute hospitals.</P>
      <P>The buildings which previously accommodated the district hospital have been adapted for use as a community care day centre, a psychiatric day centre and community care offices.  I provided £40,000 from lottery funding in 1988 to enable the necessary renovations to be carried out.  The new facilities opened in 1988 and they have greatly strengthened community care services in the area.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the position regarding Croom Orthopaedic Hospital.</P>
      <P>During 1991 it has not proved possible, from within available resources, to approve additional permanent nursing posts for Croom Orthopaedic Hospital. The deployment of existing staff within a health board is, of course, primarily a matter for the management of that board.</P>
      <P>The question of the approval of additional nursing posts for Croom Orthopaedic Hospital will be considered as sympathetically as possible in 1992, having regard to the many competing demands for resources and the board's priorities for new developments.</P>

      <P>The Health Research Board provided a total of £237,000 for a female fertility research unit in University College Galway in respect of a project &mdash; completion date 31/12/90.  The objectives of the project which was conducted between 1986 and 1990 were (a) to develop rapid, cost effective, non-isotopic methods for measuring reproductive steroid hormones in saliva and (b) to evaluate the clinical applications of those assays in natural family planning, the management of female infertility, the return of postpartum fertility, habitual abortion and in post-menopausal women undergoing hormone replacement therapy.  The final report of the project is expected to be published next month and I will arrange to let the Deputy have a copy of this report.  In the meantime, I am sending him a copy of the annual report of the HRB for 1990 in which the main achievements of the study are summarised.</P>

      <P>The long term illness scheme covers 15 specified illnesses, and there has been no extension to the scheme since 1975.</P>
      <P>The long term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
      <P>Persons, with conditions such as that described by the Deputy, who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable to meet their medical expenses without undue hardship may be granted a medical card which will entitle them to the supply of all drugs and medicines without charge.</P>
      <P>Any other person with an ongoing medical condition, which imposes a requirement for continuous medication, can benefit under the terms of the drugs cost subsidisation scheme.  This scheme limits the actual expenditure of authorised beneficiaries, on prescribed medicines, to £32 per month.</P>

      <P>I am aware that each year, during the peak Christmas period, air carriers operating between Ireland and Britain do not make available the lowest promotional air fares which are available at other times of the year.  The airlines have explained to me that it is very difficult to achieve economic loads on services out of Ireland in the pre-Christmas period and into Ireland in the post-Christmas period. This major imbalance between inbound and outbound traffic severely disrupts the normal economics of the airlines' operations and they, therefore, deem it necessary to withdraw the lowest promotional fares from the market for travel during this period.</P>
      <P>Seats are available at other promotional fares but, because of the very high level of demand for travel at Christmas, these seats are generally booked out at an early stage.  Nevertheless, I am advised by the airlines that they make every effort to accommodate passengers wishing to travel home to Ireland at Christmas by mounting additional capacity and maintaining fares at reasonable levels consistent with their commercial obligations.</P>

      <P>I am informed by my Department that the <Col N="1135" /> person referred to by the Deputy applied for a certificate of competence in respect of passenger operations but not in respect of road haulage operations.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Road Passenger Transport) Regulations, 1991, which came into operation on 21 March 1991 provided, by way of an exemption from the standard competence requirements, for the granting of a certificate of competence in road passenger transport to any person who, within 21 days after the date on which the regulations came into force, satisfied the Minister that, before 1 January 1975, he either held a large public service vehicle licence or effectively and continuously managed a road passenger transport business. Appropriate notice of this provision was promulgated through the daily newspapers.</P>
      <P>An application for a certificate of competence based on this provision was received from the person in question on 24 May 1991.  However, as this was after the deadline of 11 April 1991, the application could not be considered.  The applicant in this case has been made aware by the Department of the standard competence requirements and of the options available to him for meeting these requirements.</P>
