      <Quest>the number of meetings of the Central Review Committee of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress which have been held to date; if the March unemployment figures have been discussed by the committee; if any special meeting of the committee is planned to discuss the substantial increase in unemployment disclosed in these figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have held three meetings to date.  In addition, the Central Review Committee, including all appropriate public authorities, supplemented by representatives from the Combat Poverty Agency, the Irish Resource Development Trust and the Trust for Community Initiatives, held a meeting on 4 March 1991 to discuss arrangements for the area-based response to long-term unemployment as provided for in section VII of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> As I indicated to the House on 12 March 1991, any public statements on the deliberations of the committee are a matter for the committee themselves to decide.  It is also a matter for the committee to decide the timing and agenda of any meetings held.</P>

      <P>My question specifically related to whether the March figures for unemployment had been discussed at the meetings concerned.  May I ask the Taoiseach if those figures have been referred to?  I am sure he is aware that the figures for March of this year are the highest since March 1988 and that there is clearly a very worrying trend in relation to increasing unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures were not available for the last meeting, but the Deputy can be assured that the unemployment situation generally is a matter for concern and discussion at the committee.</P>

      <P>The emphasis in the programme appears to relate to the question of long-term unemployment which obviously is a serious matter, but the figures for March indicate new people coming on the unemployment register and the figures do not include roughly 8,000 people who were excluded from the live register because they are on various pre-retirement schemes.</P>

      <P>The areas have been selected and announced.  The whole process is under way and all the necessary arrangements have been made.  I would not be able to give the Deputy the exact number of unemployed in the areas, but he will be aware that the areas are selected on the basis that they are high unemployment black spots.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission will have the opportunity to make a public first statement to <Col N="604" /> Government later this week.  In their first statement I understand that the commission are recommending initiatives which they consider could be put into practice immediately and which, they believe, complements the equal opportunity measures in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> In line with our commitment to securing equality for women in Irish society, the Government will carefully consider the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Government 1989-1993 makes provision for a review after two years.  The implementation of the Government's objectives, as set out in the document, together with the objectives in the Fianna Fáil document <i>National Recovery</i>&mdash;<i>The Next Phase,</i> is proceeding very satisfactorily. For instance, a new programme has been concluded with the social partners; the targets for the public finances have already been substantially exceeded; tax reform and harmonisation is on target; the health services have been improved; special measures for the unemployed are being introduced in urban disadvantaged areas, the pupil-teacher ratio is being reduced, and an environmental protection agency is being established; substantial law reform is taking place.  I would also refer the Deputy to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which has been approved by the Dáil, which sets out in more detail both the recent progress achieved and ambitious objectives for the 1990s agreed by the Government with the social partners.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach said, there is provision for a review of the programme with the Progressive Democrats. Is that review under way and are there areas which are being specifically addressed?  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the press reports indicating serious dissatisfaction among the Progressive Democrat element within the Coalition are borne out by the facts within the Cabinet?</P>

      <P>My concern is not with the internal problems of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  My concern is about the programme on which the Government are operating and the extent to which it is intended to change that programme.  There are clear indications from the Progressive Democrat element of the Coalition that they are not happy with the rate of progress.  Is it proposed to change the programme?  If so, will it change only in relation to that which was negotiated with the Progressive Democrats?  Will the Fianna Fáil element of it change?  Will the submission made to the European Commission change?</P>

The National Gallery have no particular plans just at the moment, but there are other vehicles through which such contacts and exchanges are processed.

      <P>Yes, I do not disagree. It is just a question of suitability of venues, invitations and arrangements. There is quite a lot of activity going on. Some of the artists who have received CRC funding for the promotion of Irish art abroad from 1 January 1991 to date include Louis le Brocquy in Japan.  Fred Conlon, a sculptor in India, Ciaran Lennon, a painter in Spain, a group of <Col N="609" /> painters in Italy, Daniel de Chenu in Japan, Bernard McDonagh, a painter in Belgium, a group of photographic artists in the US, Joe McGill, artist and sculptor in the US, and Patrick Hall, a painter in the US.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the Czechoslovak Federal Prime Minister, Mr. Marian Calfa, I visited his country on 11 to 13 April, and had discussions with him, as well as with the Prime Ministers of the Czech and Slovak Republics, Mr. Pithart and Mr. Meciar, respectively, the Speaker of the Federal Parliament, Mr. Alexander Dubcek, the Deputy Speaker of the Czech Parliament, Mr. Kasal, and the Speaker of the Slovak Parliament, Mr. Mikloska.  The discussions took place at various locations in Prague and Bratislava.</P>
      <P>A planned meeting with President Havel had to be cancelled because he, regrettably, was taken ill.  I had no wish to impose the strain of even a brief meeting on the President but I took the opportunity of indicating that the Government here would welcome a visit by the President to Ireland at some time in the future, if he should so wish.</P>
      <P>While in Prague I was awarded the memorial medal by Charles University at an impressive ceremony in that ancient and hallowed university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subjects covered in my discussions <Col N="610" /> with Czechoslovakia's leaders included a review of the political and economic situation in our two countries, developments in the European Community including the negotiations for a new association agreement with Czechoslovakia, developments in Central and Eastern Europe, the CSCE and bilateral relations between Ireland and Czechoslovakia.</P>
    <P>At these meetings, I stressed, as appropriate, the commonality of interests between small or medium-sized countries like Czechoslovakia and Ireland and the possibility of greatly enhanced benefits to both our countries from increased exchanges of trade and services &mdash; which is now possible following the liberation of Czechoslovakia from over 40 years of oppression and its return to democracy.  Prime Minister Calfa and I agreed that, with a view to developing these possibilities further, a special group of officials should meet to draw up proposals for the development of contacts between the two countries, at both official and commercial levels and for positive and specific actions to this end.  Even though Ireland has limited resources of material wealth to dispense, we are nevertheless in a position to be of great assistance in dealings with the EC and other international organisations, as well as in the ability to provide expertise in modern administrative training and management services.</P>
    <P>I was accompanied on my visit by a delegation representative of a wide range of companies and organisations in both the public and private sectors here, including the Confederation of Irish Industry, Córas Tráchtála, Bord Tele-com, the ESB, Aer Rianta, FÁS, the two main Irish banks and other private interests.  The members of the delegation had a series of useful meetings with their opposite numbers in Prague and Bratislava and all reported a high degree of satisfaction with the results.</P>
    <P>Since my last meeting with Prime Minister Calfa, there has been a rapid growth in co-operation in a wide range of areas such as assistance in the development of <Col N="611" /> social security and health services, telecommunications, airport management and development of duty-free facilities, and education, where Trinity College has secured a contract under the EC's Tempus Programme to develop postgraduate management courses in Prague. During the course of my visit I was in a position to announce that FÁS will be organising a special course next autumn in each of the two Republics on training for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as our offer of scholarships to 15 students from Czechoslovakia to pursue third-level university and other third-level courses here, starting in October next.  At the conclusion of our discussions, Prime Minister Calfa and I signed an agreement on the abolition of visa requirements for travel between our two countries.</P>
    <P>In so far as relations with the European Community are concerned, I assured Prime Minister Calfa of Ireland's full support for the early conclusion of the association agreement with Czechoslovakia.  I also said we would be as helpful as possible in his country's dealings with the Community.  It is, of course, in all our interests, both at bilateral level and in the wider EC framework, that Czechoslovakia succeeds in its efforts to return to the market economy, given that country's position and pivotal role in Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to place on record in the House my warm apreciation of the courtesy and efficiency of our hosts in Prague and Bratislava, and my grateful memories of the gracious hospitality with which we were met in a country with a magnificent past and which now, with its liberation, has the possibility of returning to its former position among the leading countries of the world.</P>
    <P>Concerning plans to visit other east European countries, any such plans would be announced shortly in advance of the event, in accordance with the established practice in this regard.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the detail of his reply.  Clearly, the visit was fruitful.  Did the group of Ministers to whom he referred meet yet? What arrangements have been put in place for this group to meet in order to further relations between Ireland and Czechoslovakia?  Would the Taoiseach indicate whether detailed discussions took place on the CSCE given that Ireland's position on the CSCE seems to be close to the position of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republics?</P>

      <P>The Ambassador and a few key officials are meeting with the Czechoslovak side to agree a more permanent structure, a committee or group, which will have the responsibility of fostering relationships and an increased number of exchanges between the two countries.  A working group are now engaged in the task of working out with our Czechoslovak friends a more permanent structure.  They are meeting and, hopefully, they will soon bring forward suggestions for a permanent structure which I would visualise including representatives of the official, semi-State and private sectors on both sides.</P>
      <P>Certainly we talked about the CSCE; Prague will, of course, be the headquarters of the CSCE.  The Czechoslovaks are very interested in the whole CSCE process and are firmly committed to it, as we are also.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach did not meet President Havel.  In that event did he discuss with the Prime Minister the question of their ceasing to trade in arms?  Did he take the opportunity to compliment the Czech and Slovak Republics on that decision in view of <Col N="613" /> the economic difficulties that have arisen from their decision to cease trading in arms, particularly to the Middle East?  If the opportunity arose within the EC of conveying similar sentiments on the supply of arms to the Middle East would he go down that road, particularly with regard to France?</P>

      <P>It is not possible to be in Czechoslovakia, particularly Slovakia, for very long without being very much aware of the whole situation with regard to the armaments industry.  Bratislava was identified by the Communist bloc as the supplier of armaments to the Soviet and Eastern Bloc.  They had a massive arms industry there which they have now abandoned.  I agree with the Deputy that it is a very noble action on their part to give up the manufacture of armaments. To a large extent, of course, the Soviet Union is no longer a customer, and neither are any of the other countries, for these products, but it is causing them very serious problems.  Naturally, the armaments industry was a huge employer in Bratislava and they are now facing enormous employment and economic problems as a result of this and they are desperately seeking ways of introducing new types of industry and employment.</P>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach ask the Prime Minister about the continuing manufacture and export of Semtex and its sale to the Libyans and hence the IRA?  In the course of his reply the Taoiseach told us about his discussions on opportunities for Czechoslovakia to trade with the EC.  Did the Taoiseach discuss specifically whether agricultural products, particularly beef, would gain access to the EC and did he make any promise that he would assist Czechoslovakian products coming into the EC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed the question of Semtex but I think that question is now under control.</P>
      <P>Frequently I discussed with my counterparts there the question of the new type of association agreement with the EC.  As the Deputy knows there is a trade agreement in operation at present and it is now hoped to substitute it with what is now known as a third generation association agreement which is, of course, being negotiated at present.  The negotiations for that association agreement are, of course, conducted on behalf of the Community by the Commission and I would have no role in any aspect of those negotiations.  However, I did say to the Czechoslovakians that I was in favour and would help and support the idea of their getting an association agreement negotiated and implemented as quickly as possible.  Quite frankly, without an association agreement I do not think they have much future or have any real possibility of solving their many economic and social problems.  I did take it on myself to suggest to them, with regard to the difficulties that are arising in negotiating that association agreement, that a good agreement now would be much better than a perfect agreement later.  In addition, I suggested they should put all their efforts into getting an association-type agreement in place even though it might not fully meet all their present requirements.  Of course Czechoslovakia is one of the few countries in Eastern Europe, fortunately, which is self-sufficient in food.  It is a strange paradox but the co-operative farming system actually appears to have worked well in Czechoslovakia so that they do not have any problems supplying themselves with food.  But the question of access of agricultural products by Czechoslovakia to the Community is a matter for very difficult negotiations and one which is within the province of the Commission, not with me.</P>

      <P>I do not see why the Deputy should single out one member state.  The regrettable fact is that the five members of the Security Council are all in the business of supplying arms to the Middle East and the Gulf area.  This matter was discussed at our last summit meeting in Luxembourg when decisions were taken in regard to the whole question of the supply of armaments.  It was felt that must increasingly become a matter for discussion and decision by the Community.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 10 together.</P>
      <P>President de Klerk will pay a one-day working visit to Ireland on Thursday next, at the invitation of the Government, following an initial approach by the South African side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President de Klerk will be accompanied by Mrs. de Klerk and by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, <Col N="616" /> Mr. Leon Wessels.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I will have talks with President de Klerk and Mr. Wessels.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that much of the credit of the major and positive developments over the past year or so towards ending apartheid must go to President de Klerk personally, and he has given a clear undertaking to implement measures to this end, which has been welcomed by the international community, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>The visit will usefully signal the Government's firm support for the process initiated by President de Klerk.  It will also serve to mark our desire to see the momentum of that process maintained in order that the apartheid system is fully abolished at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach, that we should be gracious and acknowledge the tremendous progress that President de Klerk has brought about in his country.  Seeing that Ireland is one of two countries in the EC continuing to operate sanctions against South African produce, can the Taoiseach say whether this matter will be discussed on Thursday next during his meeting with President de Klerk?  Is the Taoiseach inclined to the view that our exercise of sanctions against South Africa should be brought to a conclusion in view of the lead shown by President de Klerk?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>I am quite sure the matter will be discussed.  Our position is fully on record in that, in this area, we move with our EC partners.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a matter for stridency but rather one for balanced, mature judgement.  What we all want to achieve is the abolition of apartheid. Ireland's record is second to none in this whole area, which has been acknowledged by all those who are working consistently for the abolition of apartheid. But we have got to ascertain how best that can be done.  In this regard we will move cautiously and carefully, in full co-operation and agreement with our European partners, to the extent that that is possible.  It appears to be the view of most people at this stage that President de Klerk has done a lot, is sincere, and should be supported.</P>

      <P>Let us for a moment imagine that if, for some reason, President de Klerk were now not to be supported and were to fail, I do not think anybody, least of all the Deputy concerned, would want that.  So we must form a judgement as to how best to get to the point we want, which is the final abolition of apartheid.  It seems to me that, at this stage, we should offer President de Klerk support in what he is trying to do in the belief that he is sincere in what he is trying to do.  That is a judgement we must make but I am prepared to make it at this stage.</P>

      <P>I might pose two questions to the Taoiseach.  First, in the consideration given by the Government to the question of whether an invitation should be extended to President de Klerk, did the Government give some consideration to views put forward by others from South Africa, the ANC and religious leaders?  Second, would the Taoiseach say whether the South African Government put forward a timetable for the dismantling of apartheid in the context of discussions they had with the Government before the invitation was extended?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not have any discussions with the South African Government.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs met President de Klerk some time ago but we did not have any recent discussions with President de Klerk before the invitation was issued.  Hopefully those discussions will take place on Thursday next.  I think I know the views of most people in this House on this issue.  I think this House and the Irish people generally have been very consistent on this issue. We did not receive what I might call any very trenchant objections to extending the invitation to President de Klerk.  The approach was made by the South Africans, in return for which we extended the invitation because we felt that, at this stage, it could do nothing but good to have a friendly, amicable meeting with President de Klerk, express our continuing concerns and ascertain how far we can advance the situation.</P>

      <P>I do not want to preempt the forthcoming discussion.  I am sure that President de Klerk will be raising the matter of sanctions with us.  I will have to listen to what he has to say.  It is my opinion that the sanctions have, to some extent, served their purpose.  I doubt very much we would be where we are today without two things: first, the sanctions and, second, President de Klerk's own personal efforts.</P>

In view of that, would the Taoiseach bear in mind in his discussions with Mr. de Klerk that the representatives of the people of South Africa &mdash; the black people specifically and the coloured people of South Africa &mdash; have asked that sanctions be maintained until irreversible advances have been made towards the dismantling of apartheid.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 21 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission's specific proposals in relation to CAP reform have not been tabled as yet and, in fact, it is likely to be some months before they are formally proposed.  The Government will obviously be giving the most detailed consideration to the reform proposals that ultimately emerge from the Commission and, in line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> I will be entering into discussions with the various organisations concerned on the approach to be adopted throughout the negotiations.  I believe that these arrangements should ensure the most widespread debate on the reforms and on the position which Ireland will adopt in the discussions in the Council later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> On the basis of the ideas contained in the reflections paper on the development and future of the Common Agricultural Policy which was presented to the Agriculture Council on 4 February I have, however, already initiated a series of bilateral consultations, at both political and official level, with the Commission and other member states.  The Government believe that these consultations, which are again in line with a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> are a vital element in presenting our views on matters relating to the Common Agricultural Policy and in ensuring that our Community partners are fully appraised of the unique importance of agriculture to Ireland's national economy.  The Deputies can be assured that I will continue to make use of all appropriate means for communicating our concerns to other governments and to the Commission and in impressing on them the need to maintain an effective Common Agricultural Policy which recognises the diversity of Community agriculture and pays particular attention to the requirements of economies such as Ireland's which are heavily dependent on agriculture.</P>

      <P>FEOGA grants amounting to £2.1 million were provided to build and equip Ballybay Meats. National grants of £0.837 million were paid by the IDA.  I understand that so far none of these moneys has been recovered. The receiver is endeavouring to sell the Ballybay plant as a going concern and this would, of course, ensure that the best return for the public investment was secured as well as protecting long-term employment in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the figure of £0.837 million which the Minister referred to is in addition to the £10 million which is owed to creditors of the company concerned?  The sum of £2.1 million represents FEOGA grants and the sum of £0.837 million represents grants from the IDA.</P>

      <P>I understand there are also considerable moneys outstanding to Fóir Teoranta.  In his reply the Minister said the best interests of the public and the taxpayer were being borne in mind by the Government when the disposal of the assets was being taken into consideration. I understand the receiver values the factory at £6 million.  Nevertheless, he is offering it for sale for £1.4 million and he cannot get that money.  Obviously this means that the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on Thursday last was correct in stating quite clearly that there is gangsterism, all sorts of intimidation and we must suspect there is a political cover up in this case.  Have the Minister and the Government any intention of seeing that the whole unsavoury episode is brought to a proper conclusion, that the full market value of the plant is obtained, that the plant is put back into production and that these people do not get away with this downright flouting and breaking of the law?</P>

      <P>That is an unwarranted and outrageous suggestion.  The Deputy did not have courage, he would only hint.  There is no basis whatsoever for that outrageous allegation.  Very detailed investigations are being conducted in four countries.  Furthermore, my Department and customs officials have been co-operating very actively to ensure that the fullest detail emerges so that such information as the police need for any action that is required will be available to them.  Let me also say that such powers as I have as Minister for Agriculture and Food in regard to the issue of licences, if it should come to that point, will certainly be very seriously considered by me before I make a decision as to who or what group should operate such a licence.  Let me assure Deputy Deasy, if he needs to be assured &mdash; I think the public are satisfied but Deputy Deasy is not &mdash; about the Government's role and my role about which he made outrageous implications.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>Because of a combination of a number of external factors, in particular the impact on Community consumption and third country markets of BSE and of the Gulf crisis, the Irish beef sector has been undergoing a particularly difficult period and has had to rely heavily on intervention support in preventing a major collapse in market prices.  A crucial factor in supporting prices has been the availability of safety-net intervention which I negotiated during the last review of the beef regime in 1989.  Community intervention stocks of beef as at 28 February 1991 are estimated at 680,000 tonnes of which Ireland accounted for 218,000 tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the onset of market difficulties last year there have been a number of visits at ministerial and official level to <Col N="633" /> third countries to assure international buyers of the quality and wholesomeness of our beef and there has been constant contact at official level with the authorities in these markets.  Furthermore representatives from a number of third countries accepted invitations to visit this country to see our control systems at first hand.  As a result a number of our export markets have been reopened and I expect further progress will be made in this regard as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I should also draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the CBF grant-in aid has been increased by the Government to £1.5 million, subject to voluntary contributions being forthcoming from the meat processors.  I have also secured from EC Structural Funds an additional £2.5 million for CBF payable over a three year period.  The total amount available to CBF in 1991 will be £7.2 million compared with £5.05 million in 1990.  This will enable a considerably expanded promotional effort to be undertaken by CBF, an effort which will be enhanced by their quality assurance scheme.</P>
    <P>CBF are conducting a vigorous marketing campaign in Europe.  I have personally taken part in special promotions in Germany, Spain and Italy and I am confident of a positive response from these and other European markets.  In so far as disposals of intervention stocks are concerned the Commission has been actively seeking purchasers for intervention beef and a number of export sales have been effected.</P>
    <P>A serious downturn has occurred on the world dairy market since late 1989 with commodity products affected in particular. Intervention stocks of butter and skimmed milk powder in the Community now stand at 315,000 tonnes and 346,000 tonnes respectively, of which 94,000 tonnes of butter and 92,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder are of Irish origin.</P>
    <P>In an effort to restore market buoyancy, the Commission increased the disposal aids and the level of export refunds on milk products.  The downturn was to a large degree caused by exceptional trading developments in Eastern Europe. <Col N="634" /> The stabilisation of the situation in Eastern Europe should help the markets to recover although there is a continuing underlying problem with the disposal of butter, because of falling demand for that product.</P>
    <P>As far as Ireland is concerned, the dairy industry has no other short term option but to avail of the support mechanisms at a time of depressed markets. In the longer term the moves towards rationalisation and restructuring will enable the industry to diversify its product portfolio to reduce its reliance on commodity products.</P>
    <P>I have constantly urged producers and the industry generally in both the beef and dairy sectors to avail fully of the advantage of Ireland's image as a producer of wholesome product from a natural and clean environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 19 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My attitude to the use of illegal substances in livestock production is well known and I am committed to take the most rigorous action against any irresponsible and unrepresentative elements who would attempt to supply, use or encourage the use of these substances.  It is essential that a country such as Ireland, <Col N="635" /> should be able to give consumers at home and abroad the assurances, they so rightly demand, that the meat they purchase is pure and wholesome.</P>
    <P>I have introduced stringent legislative and enforcement measures to detect and deal with any abuses in this area.  Our regulations provide for a total prohibition on the manufacture, importation, sale, possession and use of illegal substances. Approximately 400 authorised officers of my Department have extensive powers to search, examine and sample for evidence of possession, trade in or use of illegal substances.  Where appropriate, members of the Garda Síochána and officers of Customs and Excise are similarly authorised.  Veterinary examiners at slaughtering facilities are empowered, on suspicion, to detain, examine and sample any animal or meat and, if the use of illegal substances is confirmed, to condemn such animals or meat.  Farmers supplying illegally treated animals are subject to special investigation which includes locking up and testing of their herds.</P>
    <P>Because of my determination that any drift towards the use of illegal growth promoters be counteracted and stopped, I launched an intensive campaign at farm level last November and established a special team of officers to carry out these duties.  I have met this issue head on and tackled the matter in the most effective way possible by focusing on the administration stage where a urine test will give a definitive result.  All this activity will result in prosecution of a number of people for possession of or use of these substances.  Farmers and distributors are being left in no doubt as to my determination to protect the welfare of consumers and the reputation of our beef industry.  Regrettably, certain media elements have chosen to misrepresent this vigorous pre-emptive action by distorted presentations.</P>
    <P>My Department's staff at our Embassy in London react to adverse media attention by contacting the editors of the publications involved with a view to having such unsupported allegations retracted. Where appropriate, letters have issued <Col N="636" /> to editors for publication in the journals involved.  In addition CBF have been fully briefed as to the factual position on the use of illegal substances and the measures being taken to counteract such abuse in order that the necessary assurances can be given to customers.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that I met privately farmer representatives and representatives of the meat industry for an exchange of views on matters of mutual interest including, <i>inter alia,</i> the issue of illegal use of growth promoters.  I have underlined my determination to stamp out any abuses and have been assured of the full support of the industry in this.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have notified the Commission of the European Communities of the strict controls I have put in place and have requested the introduction of similar controls throughout the Community on a harmonised basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, unfortunately, the measures he has taken have not been satisfactory?  There is no evidence to indicate that there has been any reduction in the use of this chemical which changes fat into lean meat and the Irish beef industry is seriously threatened because of the abuse by some individuals.  Will the Minister bring in measures which will make it nonviable for people to use angel dust?  Will the Minister introduce a mandatory jail sentence &mdash; I know there is a threat of a jail sentence but nobody has been brought before the courts yet to answer a charge in this regard &mdash; to protect the industry?  Our image abroad is seriously suffering.  I have refrained from commenting on the matter up to now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Pending that, let me assure the Deputy &mdash; I have made this very clear&mdash; that imprisonment, and/or fines and, if necessary, increased levels of imprisonment and fines will certainly be considered by me.  However, as the Deputy knows, I do not have the right to demand mandatory jail sentences as that is always at the discretion of the courts.  I assure the Deputy that, in presenting such evidence as the courts would require to help them assess the sentences they should impose, they will have a very full picture from officials of my Department, and others, as to the damage being done to our economy by these treacherous, unrepresentative people.  I want to get the message across that the standards we have put in place are the most stringent in the European Community.  As Minister, I have put these standards in place on behalf of the Government and I want to see the same standards in other member states because that is the best guarantee to the consumers.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent survey of farm incomes, prepared for Co-operation North by Queens University, Belfast and University College, Dublin, which showed that the likelihood of relative poverty for rural households has remained at approximately 30 per cent since 1973; if he has any plans to deal with the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the survey referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the percentage quoted by the Deputy refers only to the risk, rather <Col N="638" /> than to the existence, of relative poverty, the report indicates a low income problem among certain categories of farmers. Farm households, where there is no alternative source of income and where the main activity is drystock farming, are identified as those most at risk.  A number of initiatives, under the auspices of the operational programme for rural development have been put in place to address such problems, <i>inter alia,</i> by creating alternative sources of income to supplement farm income for those who cannot make an adequate livelihood from farming alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister recognises the content of the report is important as it describes the scale of farm poverty.  Noting that poverty exists in households on small and medium sized farms and that subsidy and headage payments account for a good percentage of the income to such households, will the Minister agree that the changes now proposed in the Common Agricultural Policy will worsen the situation for such people? In regard to restructuring, will a policy which the people can follow be presented to them?  Will the Minister state clearly and categorically if there is such a policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot comment on the changes which may be introduced in proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy as they have not yet been tabled.  However, I understand from the Commission that the intention is to support and help low income farmers and, therefore, I do not agree with the Deputy's interpretation of the reports we are hearing at present.  Let me also assure the Deputy that other aids available to us in terms of increased headage payments which apply in those areas, particularly premium payments, will be specifically targeted at low income farmers.  I should also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the programme for rural development to which I referred.  This is a major opportunity to enhance incomes in areas which would otherwise be low income farm areas.</P>

      <P>The IDA strategy for the food and drink industry 1988-92, through which Government policy for the industry is being implemented, states quite clearly in the chapter on the dairy sector that the authority will actively promote and support restructuring of the Irish dairy industry through amalgamations, mergers and acquisitions.  In pursuance of this policy, which is essential to secure the long term future of the dairy industry in increasingly difficult and competitive international markets, the authority have been in discussion for some years with the main companies in the sector regarding their development plans.  However, it would be inappropriate to comment on any particular discussions which may have taken place with individual companies as these are confidential between the Authortity and the companies concerned.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Minister is telling the House the Government see it as appropriate for the IDA to act as an initiator and a facilitator in terms of mergers in the dairy industry.  What is the Government's concern about jobs in the dairy industry, particularly in some of our small towns where high tech jobs are involved in that industry?  If there are mergers, these jobs will be lost which will be a very serious loss to the towns, especially when they are added to the number of other jobs lost.  Are the Government losing sight of the fact that the most important consideration in any industry is the protection of jobs?</P>

      <P>The concern of the Government is the creation of an internationally competitive dairy industry in Ireland.  The Government are aware of the increasing international competitive aspect of the dairy industry world wide. With challenges like the reform of the CAP, the emergence of supplies from Eastern Europe and the impact of the GATT negotiations, there is an increasingly competitive international climate for the dairy industry to survive in.  The Industrial Development Authority are aware of this increased competitiveness but they also appreciate the importance of retaining as many jobs as possible, and it is a part of their policy to provide additional jobs.  As a part of the policy from 1988 to 1992 they visualise the creation of 750 additional jobs in the industry.</P>

Are we to have two co-operatives or five co-operatives; has any figure been mentioned?  Is it the Minister's strategy to reduce the number of co-operatives significantly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no specific number of co-operatives.  What is quite clear is that the structure of the industry has to be rationalised and made more efficient and that can be done by co-operatives merging or between co-operatives where, at particular times of the year because of the seasonality of production, they can co-operate in the production of various products.  What is quite clear is that the development of an efficient processing industry in Ireland is the only way for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The basic cause of the present situation in the bakery industry is not the recent bread price war which was dealt with in some detail by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on 12 February but a longstanding over-capacity problem in the industry combined with changing consumer patterns and the entry into the industry of new and more efficient operators. These facts were acknowledged in the report of a study of the industry carried out by the Sectoral Development Committee last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as my Department's area of responsibility is concerned, the main recommendation in this report is that the industry itself is best placed to take the initiative in planning its future and that it should do so with the minimum of Government involvement.  Based on that recommendation, I would see the role of <Col N="642" /> my Department to examine rationalisation proposals put forward by the industry and to encourage and support such proposals where it is appropriate to do so.  The other main recommendations in the report are matters for other Government Ministers in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised at the Minister's reply to this question when he says that the recommendations are a matter for other Government Ministers. Would the Minister not agree that the traditional bakeries closed in the wake of the removal of Government retail price maintenance and bread subsidies to bakeries and the development by the bigger bakeries of high technology?  Would he accept that the recommendation for a multiple grocer fair trading rules and a definition of what maximum share of the grocery trade may not be exceeded, which would help to bring some bit of fair play to the smaller bakeries, would be very desirable?  Would the Minister not agree that he should take on board those recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficult situation in the bakery industry.  In fact there was a loss of over 3,000 jobs between 1982 and 1989.  However, at this point the industry is stabilising.  I note recently one large company, by association of seven to eight bakeries with the one brand product, has been carrying out quite a useful job.  I see stabilisation in the industry now and hopefully the job losses are at an end.</P>

      <P>On the possibility of something similar happening in the milk trade, I had a Private Notice Question down which was refused on the grounds that it was not urgent.  Given the figures produced by the Minister now in regard to job losses in the bakery trade, would he not agree that it is urgent that something be done about the milk trade and the supply to supermarkets before a similar situation arises in that industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a great need for consumer information and information concerning the dietary aspects of bread? Some years ago it was one of the main staples of every household, whether it was home baked or bought.  Now there seems to be some question about the consumption of bread.  Would the Minister agree that there is a need for an educational promotional exercise?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the five Private Notice Questions together.  Before I address the specific questions I should like to make a few general points.</P>
      <P>At this morning's Government meeting the serious issues which arise from this dispute were considered very carefully.  I should like to read into the record of the House the text of a statement which the Government have issued:</P>
      <P>At their meeting this morning the Government considered the very serious situation which has arisen as a result of the strike action by electricians employed by the ESB which is being supported by other key workers in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are extremely concerned that a dispute in this essential industry should have occurred so soon after agreement on a new three year <Col N="645" /> National Programme had been reached between all the social partners and the Government and after this Programme and the Pay Agreement associated with it had been overwhelmingly endorsed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They deeply regret the serious disruption to production and employment, and to the social services and the inconvenience and hardship caused to families especially to the aged and the ill which will be inevitable if this dispute continues.</P>
    <P>The dispute comes at a time when the country has begun to get on top of many of the fundamental problems both social and economic which we have faced in recent years.  Any setback to this progress would be completely unjustifiable when the country faces uncertainty in the international scene.  Disputes of this kind make all the more difficult the task of creating the jobs which we need.</P>
    <P>The interests of the country and its people cannot be allowed to take second place to the interests of any one group of workers when there are procedures to enable their grievances to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined that the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> shall be adhered to.  The electricians claim can be assessed by procedures in that context.  The Government therefore in the public interest call for a return to normal work immediately while the appropriate procedures to look at any possible grievances are put in train.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate from this statement that all members of the Government have been fully informed of the situation.  I should like to assure Deputies that my Department are in regular contact with the Departments of Labour and Finance and with the ESB and the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>I want to briefly summarise the background to the dispute.  As the House will be generally aware, about 18 months ago the Electrical Trade Union initiated a claim for a salary increase for electricians <Col N="646" /> mainly on the grounds of impact of reorganisation in 1986.  A number of negotiating sessions took place with the union but as no agreement could be reached the claim was referred to the ESB's Joint Industrial Council in September 1990. The council issued their recommendation on 14 November 1990 which effectively requested both parties to meet again to find a solution.</P>
    <P>The sides met subsequently on at least two occasions.  The matter was then referred back to the Joint Industrial Council who ruled that one in-scale increment would apply to all electricians and that electricians on their natural maximum, that is those who may not advance further without promotion or progression through qualifications, as agreed, be paid a once-off lump sum of £650.  The ESB accepted the decision of the Joint Industrial Council.  However, the ETU rejected the council's ruling. Following expiry of the 30 day cooling-off period which applied after the issue of the council recommendation, which is in accordance with agreed procedures, the union informed the ESB by letter of 5 April 1991 that their executive, having carefully considered the matter at issue, decided to sanction entering into an official dispute with the ESB.  This letter formally put the ESB on 14 days notice to that effect.</P>
    <P>Further meetings took place all day Friday last but negotiations broke down. The strike took effect from yesterday morning and the Labour Relations Commission immediately invited the parties for exploratory discussions.  Those discussions have continued today and are in progress this afternoon.  I understand that due to the serious nature of the dispute the full Labour Relations Commission will meet this evening to consider the situation.</P>
    <P>Anyone in the House who was listening to the 1 o'clock news will have heard of the widespread disruption which has been caused all over the country.  All sections of the community, industry, agriculture, commerce, health services and domestic consumers have had to endure lengthy power cuts.  This afternoon the ESB have <Col N="647" /> 1,250 megawatts of operational plant compared with a normal peak load of about 2,100 megawatts.  While the situation is finely balanced, the ESB hope they will continue to have sufficient capacity to operate the published rota system.  Arrangements to share equitably the available power are hampered by the fact that switching would normally be carried out by ETU members.  This may mean that it will not be possible to follow the published rota in all areas.  Yesterday the ESB were in contact with hospitals around the country and I understand that almost all of them have stand-by generation facilities.  Of course, the ESB will endeavour to give priority to such essential users of electricity.</P>
    <P>To summarise, it is, therefore, clear to me that the effects the dispute are having are totally out of proportion to any possible grievances which could be felt by the workers concerned.  This, of course, results from the nature of the industry concerned.  Adequate machinery exists to have any grievance considered.  I want to conclude by reiterating the Government's request for a return to work immediately while the appropriate procedures to look at any possible grievances are put in train.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask for brief, relevant and succinct questions.  I take the view that one supplementary question from the five Deputies involved should be adequate in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, a Cheann Comhairle, I am sure you will accept my raising two points in the one question.  I should like to indicate that Fine Gael issued a request today to both sides to return to work while discussions are going on.  I should like to ask the Minister to deal more specifically with the point raised in my question &mdash; the plans he has to deal with an ongoing dispute.  Does he have any emergency plans in place?  Can he guarantee a minimum level of service? What kind of reassurances or commitments can he give people generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, is the Minister aware that <Col N="648" /> this is the third time during the last decade that we have been faced with a dispute of this nature?  Similar disputes took place in 1984 and 1987.  Can he be satisfied with a situation where industrial relations problems have clearly not been resolved?  Have his Department looked at this matter?  Have they made any effort to ensure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I did ask for brevity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that this type of dispute will not occur again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out first that there are adequate and extensive procedures available to the union in this case which have not yet been fully explored.</P>
      <P>In regard to the point raised by the Deputy, it is not possible for me to say with certainty what amount of power will be available at any given time from now on.  If this dispute continues for a long period a very serious situation will develop.  The reason for this will be the non-availability of electricians who would normally share out supplies, which they have done in previous disputes when the shift workers in the power stations were on strike.  That facility is not available to us down the line throughout the country. In the event of power cuts taking place the board cannot operate on the normal rota and zone system which has been used in the past to share out electricity.  They cannot guarantee to do this with any accuracy now for the reasons I have given.  However, the ESB have assured me that they will, of course, make every effort to share out the available electricity as fairly and efficiently as possible.  It is therefore unlikely that definite advance notice of power availability on a geographic or time basis can be given on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As you will be aware, a Cheann Comhairle, I initially directed this question to the Department of Labour as I believe it is solely an industrial relations problem and should have <Col N="649" /> been dealt with by the Minister for Labour here this afternoon.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to recommend a resolution of this dispute.  I urge both the ESB and the ETU to resolve this dispute today in the national interest.</P>
      <P>Was the Minister not aware of this festering problem in the ESB which dates back to 1986?  Was he not aware that the cooling-off period had expired?  Was he not further aware that negotiations had broken down last Friday?  Where were the Labour Court, the conciliation officers and the Labour Relations Commission on that occasion?</P>
      <P>We were told in the House that they would resolve the problems even before they surfaced.  Where were they?  Would the Minister not agree that this strike could have been avoided if action had been taken last Friday?  The Government should take a major share of the responsibility for this strike and for the overall disruption today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's initial statement urging workers to return to work.  Those sentiments are shared by everybody.  All the procedures available to the workers and the union involved have not yet been fully explored.  This strike started yesterday morning and the Labour Relations Commission acted immediately so it is improper to seek to place the blame on any of the members for the official response with regard to that commission.  They have acted as quickly and as efficiently as they could in the matter.</P>
      <P>Exploratory talks between both sides were initiated yesterday by the commission. Those discussions are continuing this afternoon.  The full commission will hear the case.  This claim went through the Joint Industrial Council which is unique to the ESB workers, under an independent chairman, who made recommendations which were not accepted by the union side but were accepted by the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge Deputies in the House to <Col N="650" /> be careful.  This is a very sensitive dispute. It is having a widespread effect on the lives and well being of our citizens and is causing untold hardship throughout the country.  It is important that we should not seek to try to resolve the specifics and the details of the dispute in this House. The Departments of Labour and Energy, the officials in the ESB and the officials in the Labour Relations Commission are devoting all their resources and time to trying to find a solution within the agreed procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party also regret that this dispute has happened having regard to its implications for industry and the consumer.  Has the Minister not agreed that the origins of this dispute go back to the rationalisation of 1986, that in fact it is a matter that was proper to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> rather than the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and that the union concerned sought to intrude their concerns into the negotiations at the time of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> being put in place? Is it not without precedent, that in a dispute of this gravity the Labour Relations Commission have worked on the matter over the weekend?  I would remind the House that my question also was to the Minister for Labour.  Are we now to find that as well as the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission being absent from the country at the weekend, as he is entitled to be, the Minister for Labour was also absent?  Although the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission is entitled to be away, the process of industrial relations is not entitled to be held up as a result.  The Government bear a great share of the culpability for this dispute having got to this grave stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may serve the Deputy's interests to seek to place the blame where it does not lie, but that does not help us find a satisfactory solution to a grave problem.  This is not the time or place to debate any detail of this dispute.  This House in its wisdom has established extensive procedures which have proved <Col N="651" /> to be efficient and effective in the past.  I would urge workers to avail of existing facilities under existing procedures and have meaningful discussions which would lead to a resolution of this dispute as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister for Energy is trying to reply for the Minister for Labour.  What has the Minister for Energy been doing for the past 44 days &mdash; the 30 days cooling off period and the 14 days' strike notice? With a major crisis facing the country, why were the Minister and the management of the ESB caught flat footed? Both of them underestimated the effect of this strike and the support it would have.  Did the Minister report to Government 44 days ago that a problem was looming in the ESB which would mean a major crisis, and ensure that steps were taken to resolve the problem?  What priority does the Minister for Energy give to major industries such as Irish Steel and Fruit of the Loom, where hundreds of jobs are at stake, and to dairy farmers, in the allocation of electricity supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained to the House the difficulty in guaranteeing priorities.  The ESB will exercise as much discretion as they can in trying to meet the greatest needs particularly where there might be hardship.  The effect is not confined to the industries which have been mentioned.  The effect is widespread.  I would again urge the union involved to consider the seriousness of the position and enter into meaningful discussions with the ESB under the procedures available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, in view of the fact of there being no fewer than four strikes in this area in recent years, that it indicates a lack of long-term strategy?  Would he agree that every effort should be made to have a &ldquo;no strike&rdquo; clause in the agreement between <Col N="652" /> unions and the ESB so that this type of industrial action can never happen again?</P>

      <P>Thank you.  What concerns me, and I hope it concerns the Government, is that, arising from the Minister's earlier reply to my supplementary, he clearly indicated to the <Col N="653" /> House that he cannot give any guarantee in relation to supplies.  Can he answer the charge that this must amount to Government negligence in view of the fact that this is not the first time this decade we have faced this situation, and that we could be facing into a week, at the end of which we do not know whether the people will have access to a vital national resource at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this Finance Bill is to provide a legislative basis for the taxation measures which I announced, or foreshadowed, in my Financial Statement on 30 January.  Despite the constraints imposed by difficult external conditions, the <Col N="756" /> Government are making further significant steps in taxation reform again in 1991.  The provisions of this Bill, taken with those of the 1990 Finance Act, represent major progress towards gearing our tax system to the needs of the economy and to the requirements of the EC single market.  In a little more than one year, we will have achieved: a reduction of 3 percentage points in the standard and top rates of income tax; a cut of 4 percentage points in the standard VAT rate; a considerable narrowing of the difference in excises between this country and the UK; a reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax to 40 per cent from 1 April this year; and significant reductions in the top rates of capital taxes.</P>
    <P>This progress in reducing rates does not, however, represent the full extent of the Government's commitment to tax reform.  It has to be seen in conjunction with: (a) our determination to improve tax collection and enforcement, so that taxes due are paid promptly and fairly. This year's Bill contains important initiatives in relation to the administration of capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty and capital gains tax, which means that all our main taxes are now on a self-assessment basis; (b) our commitment to broadening the tax-base generally, to making the tax system more equitable, and to ensuring that special reliefs and incentives are better targeted.  This year's Bill maintains the thrust of earlier years, towards reducing the cost of &ldquo;tax-expenditures&rdquo;, seeking to maximise their effectiveness and giving a fair deal to everyone; (c) our firm intention to build on the progress already made, especially in relation to personal income tax, which is no important for the attainment of our employment goals; and (d) our commitment to disciplined management of the public finances which, in the final analysis, is crucial to sustainable lower tax rates.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the specific provisions of this Bill, I will outline our broad economic and budgetary strategy and comment briefly on the immediate prospects for the economy, and on budgetary developments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> The Government's economic strategy in the last few years has been based on lower public borrowing, improved competitiveness and strict adherence to our obligations in the EMS.  This created the conditions for lower inflation and lower interest rates, which benefit everybody, and inspired greater investor and consumer confidence.  These, in turn, resulted in a rate of economic growth among the highest in the EC, and, most important of all, in higher employment. By any standards the strategy was an outstanding success, not least because this progress was accompanied by sound economic fundamentals.  With these, we are in a much better condition to withstand the present downturn in the international economy.  By adhering to this broad strategy, we will be well placed too to benefit from its upturn in due course. The Government will be resolute in this regard despite the difficulties which the international scene may pose for us this year.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was the cornerstone of much of the economic and social advances of the past three years.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> continues that strategy which underpinned the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Its primary aim is to develop a modern, efficient economy capable of sustained economic and employment growth.  Only in this way can we earn the resources necessary to address broader social objectives.</P>
    <P>Budgetary discipline must, and will, be maintained under the programme.  In my budget speech I reaffirmed our mediumterm objective of progressively reducing the debt-GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993, and our longer term aim of bringing this ratio more into line with the rest of the European Community.  The budget target for 1991 &mdash; which envisages total borrowing of just under 2 per cent &mdash; was set with this goal firmly in mind.</P>
    <P>The pay accord in the programme should help to consolidate the competitive gains of recent years.  It should also ensure a further improvement in workers' living standards, against a background of <Col N="758" /> good industrial relations.  The combination of moderate pay increases, low inflation and income tax concessions in excess of £800 million on a cumulative basis gave substantial increases in real take home pay over the PNR period. The tax concessions in this year's budget combined with the pay increases agreed in the programme and an expected inflation rate of 3 per cent, provide the basis for a further increase in real take home pay this year.</P>
    <P>Our policy of improving benefits for those on social welfare is being maintained. An innovative new approach is being adopted towards tackling unemployment black spots.  Structural reforms aimed at making us a more competitive efficient economy will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The policy strategy which is reflected in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> in this year's budget measures and in the Government's stance generally is giving the right signals to investors both at home and abroad.  The credibility of economic policy is central to maintaining the confidence in Ireland which is crucial to our future.  A climate which encourages and sustains investment, the engine of growth, is the only solid basis for employment creation.  This credibility was established during the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and it is being reinforced by the broad consensus which now obtains, for the continuation of that economic strategy in the new programme.</P>
    <P>Turning to the prospects for 1991, I made it plain in presenting my budget that 1991 would undoubtedly be a difficult year.  It was inescapable that slower growth abroad would affect us adversely. It was largely on this account that I projected that our growth rate this year would be less than half that of 1990.  The prospect is that the international economy may be somewhat weaker, at least in the first half of the year, than expected two months ago.  The UK authorities, who had been forecasting a modest rise in output this year, are now talking about a decline of 2 per cent.  Moreover, the prospect for growth in our continental EC trading partners &mdash; particularly in <Col N="759" /> Germany &mdash; is now weaker than forecast at the end of last year.</P>
    <P>Though it will be no easy task to attain our Budget Day forecasts for growth, I remain optimistic about the short term prospects for the Irish economy.  Better competitiveness and lower inflation should enable us to increase our share even in weaker international markets. The decisive conclusion to the Gulf crisis should see a resumption of strong investment growth, supported here by EC Structural Funds and by businesses continuing to gear up for the EC Single Market.  The measures taken in the budget, together with the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> will help to sustain investor confidence, and they will boost real incomes as the year advances.  Most of the domestic economic indicators which have become available since the end of January relate to developments in 1990 but, in so far as they throw some light on prospects for this year, they support the view that 1991 will be a year of more modest progress.  Manufacturing output remains subdued, at least in comparison with the very strong expansion of recent years, and consumer and investment spending have shown a weaker trend.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind, of course, that our information essentially pre-dates the ending of the Gulf War.  Not only did the war have adverse direct effects on international trade, but the associated uncertainty also damaged consumer and investor confidence.  It is no surprise that expenditure on durables was restrained in the earlier part of the year, and as might be expected, indirect tax receipts felt the impact.</P>
    <P>Of course, it must be borne in mind, in interpreting the tax returns, that at this stage what we are looking at is, in effect, the tail-end of the 1990-91 tax year.  Consequently, year-on-year comparisons reflect the full impact of the reductions in tax rates introduced in the 1990 budget, both in the area of indirect taxation and in income tax.  As we get further into the year, the influence of this factor will become less significant.  In any case, we <Col N="760" /> have yet to see the impact on consumer spending of the budget and the new programme measures which, for the most part, take increasing effect as the year progresses.  These should give a boost to the revenue trend in the months ahead. As far as expenditure is concerned, outlays on social welfare have been affected by higher than expected unemployment in the first quarter, consequent on the sharp fall in net emigration.  This apart, expenditure trends for the year to date show no significant departure from the expected pattern of departmental spending profiles.</P>
    <P>Given the particular uncertainties which are a feature of 1991, it was bound to be difficult to evaluate the overall budgetary picture until a good part of the year would have passed.  Nevertheless, the Government will monitor the evolving situation very closely, and will not hesitate to do what is necessary.</P>
    <P>The recent reduction in domestic interest rates was a welcome development.  In that context I would like to pay tribute to those financial institutions which passed on the 0.5 per cent reduction to their borrowers and mortgage holders with the minimum of delay.  While we will continue to be constrained by the international interest rate environment I would hope that it will be possible for Irish interest rates to more fully reflect our strong economic fundamentals.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address the individual sections of the Bill.  Details of these sections are contained in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies with the Bill.</P>
    <P>The opening sections of the Bill deal with the substantial package of income tax reliefs I announced in the budget.  All in all, nearly 700,000 taxpayers will see their marginal income tax rate reduced as a result of these changes.  These reliefs continue the established trend in income tax policy of making special provision for the low paid, especially those with children, extending the standard band, and reducing the top and standard rates of tax.</P>
    <P>Increasing the general exemption limits is an effective way of relieving <Col N="761" /> income tax for the low paid.  These limits are being increased by £150 for a single person and £300 for a married couple, with the age exemption limits going up by a similar amount.  The child addition, which I introduced in 1989 at £200 per child and increased to £300 per child last year, is being raised to £500 per child in respect of the third and subsequent children.  This year's measures will exempt some 18,000 taxpayers with 23,000 children from tax altogether.  A further 26,500 taxpayers with 36,000 children will be brought into marginal relief.  The marginal relief rate itself is being reduced to 52 per cent; two years ago this rate stood at 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is the third year in a row in which I have substantially increased the exemption limits.  In 1988, the exemption limit for a married couple was £5,500 and took no account of children.  It is now £6,800, an increase of nearly 25 per cent.  For a married couple with three children, the increase is to £7,900, or nearly 44 per cent.  For a couple with five children, the new figure is £8,900, which is an increase of over 60 per cent.  These substantial increases in the income tax thresholds, in conjunction with family income supplement which I improved further in this year's budget, represent an effective response to the position of low-income families, while ensuring an incentive to take up employment.</P>
    <P>Widening the standard-rate band has the desirable effect of pushing up the income levels at which higher tax rates are reached.  The standard band is being extended by £200 for a single person and £400 for a married couple.  This is the fourth year in succession in which this band has been extended.  It was £4,700 for a single person, and £9,400 for a married couple, in 1987; these figures are now £6,700 and £13,400 respectively, an increase of over 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the personal allowance is being increased by £50 for a single person and 100 for a married couple, with appropriate consequential changes in the widowed personal allowance and in the widowed parent and single parent allowances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> The third area on which income tax policy has concentrated in recent years is the actual rates of tax themselves.  This year I am providing for a reduction of 1 per cent in both the standard top tax rates.  This brings them to 29 and 52 per cent respectively: before the 1989 budget, they stood at 35 and 58 per cent.</P>
    <P>In other words, the past few years have seen very substantial improvements in the three focal points of income tax policy: the general exemption limits have been increased over the last three budgets by at least 25 per cent, and in some cases by over 60 per cent when the child addition is taken into account; the standard rate has been cut since 1989 by more than one-sixth; and the top rate of tax cut by more than one-tenth and the standard band has been extended by over 40 per cent, so that a significantly lower proportion of taxpayers face the higher rates. This is the way to deal with the tax wedge that is so much talked about: by real and substantial progress on extending the standard band and by reducing our tax rates.</P>
    <P>These would be no mean achievements in any economy.  Against the backdrop of the severe budgetary constraints imposed by the need to restore order to the public finances, they are clear proof of the Government's determination to reform taxation.  Of course, despite these achievements, the Government recognise that more remains to be done as budgetary circumstances allow.  I made this clear in my budget speech: the Government's aim, as I said, will be to reduce both the standard and top rates of tax by 2 per cent in each of the next two years.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains additional provisions to respond to the needs of certain taxpayers.  A new allowance is being introduced to help widowed parents cope financially in the difficult bereavement period which follows the death of their spouse.  This allowance, which will apply for the three years following that in which the spouse dies, will be £1,500 for the first year, £1,000 for the second year and £500 for the third year.  This is being implemented in such a way that those <Col N="763" /> people whose spouse died since 6 April last year will qualify.  The ceilings on the relief on rent for persons aged 55 years or over who live in private rented accommodation are being increased from £750 to £1,000 for a single person and from £1,500 to £2,000 for a married person.  In addition, I have decided to introduce a special ceiling of £1,500 for widowed persons. Finally, as announced in the budget, the PAYE allowance is being made available to persons whose place of employment is outside the State where they are paying tax under a PAYE-type system.</P>
    <P>The last section in Chapter I arises from my announcement last December of certain relaxations in exchange controls. I said that individuals would, subject to certain conditions, be permitted to open foreign currency accounts with Irish financial institutions.  I pointed out that deposit interest retention tax would apply to interest from such accounts, and that therefore permission to open them would have to await the passage of the Finance Bill.  In keeping with this announcement, section 11 provides for the application of deposit interest retention tax to interest from foreign currency accounts held by individuals, with effect from 1 June 1991.  Non-resident individuals opening new foreign currency accounts on or after that date will, of course, be able to receive interest gross on presentation of the usual declaration of non-residence.  Existing foreign currency accounts of non-residents will not be affected by the provision; nor will accounts of companies.</P>
    <P>Chapter II of the Bill deals with the relief for investment in corporate trades, commonly known as the business expansion scheme.  It provides for the changes set out in the Financial Resolution passed by this House on budget day, 30 January, and for the transitional arrangements and other measures relating to the scheme which I announced in my statement of 12 March.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the changes are as follows.  To begin with, the scheme itself is being extended for two years, until 5 April <Col N="764" /> 1993.  Secondly, shipping, hotels, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation are being excluded from the scheme. Thirdly, the amount of BES funding an individual company can raise under the scheme is being reduced, from £2.5 million to £500,000.  Fourthly, a lifetime cap of £75,000 is being imposed on the amount on which an individual taxpayer can claim relief.  Subject to transitional arrangements which I will come to in a moment, these measures relate to shares issued on or after 30 January.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that on 12 March I issued a statement setting out transitional arrangements to apply to companies which, in the period between 1 January 1990 and 30 January 1991, had entered into binding contracts in writing to purchase or lease land or buildings, or plant or machinery, or to construct or refurbish a building, in the case of manufacturing, international services, or tourism companies; or to purchase a ship, in the case of shipping companies.  Companies which had entered into such contractual commitments by the date would, subject to meeting certain conditions, be permitted to raise up to £1 million in BES funding &mdash; less any BES funding already raised, of course.  To qualify under those arrangements, shares must be issued by 31 August 1991.  Section 14 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>My 12 March statement also dealt with two other matters, multiple companies and loans to subsidiaries, and section 15 includes provision for those.  After budget day, evidence began to emerge of the increasing use of multiple company structures.  These were clearly intended to get around the new £500,000 limit, and I said that I would be introducing measures to counter this development. The Bill provides that, where a company is party to an arrangement or understanding or agreement with another company or companies which is designed to circumvent the £500,000 per company limit, they will be entitled, not to £500,000 each, but to £500,000 divided equally among all the companies.</P>
    <P>The other provision of section 15 ends the facility for a company to on-lend to a <Col N="765" /> qualifying subsidiary funds raised under the BES; such funds can, in future, only be used to acquire shares in, rather than on-lend to, the subsidiary.  The ability to on-lend BES funds was being used to give quasi-guarantees to investors under the scheme.  Such guarantees meant that the risk which an equity-holder normally accepts was being shifted away, and the BES investor was in effect not a shareholder, but a creditor.  This practice was not within the spirit of the scheme's objectives.</P>
    <P>These two provisions will apply in respect of eligible shares issued on or after 12 March, except for companies qualifying under the transitional arrangements, or where a company had applied to Revenue for outline BES approval, or issued a BES prospectus, before that date.</P>
    <P>Section 46 also provides, as I announced in the budget, that if a self-employed taxpayer's preliminary tax payment under self-assessment is based on 100 per cent of his liability for the previous year, he must exclude for this purpose the effect of any BES relief to which he was entitled for that year.  Otherwise, a BES investment would serve to reduce not only tax liability for that year but also the preliminary tax payment in the following year.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with the business expansion scheme, I would like to make some general remarks about the scheme and about the purpose of the changes being made to it.  The first point I want to emphasise is that the objective of the changes is to refocus the BES on its proper purpose of generating capital for smaller, riskier companies.  Hence, the exclusion of asset-backed sectors and the reduction of the company limit from £2.5 million to £500,000.  Without these changes, the cost of renewing the scheme would have been prohibitive.  Renewal was, therefore, made possible by them.</P>
    <P>The second thing I want to do is to nail the accusation that the BES is dead as far as tourism is concerned.  It is not.  There is still a large number of non-accommodation tourist facilities which qualify for <Col N="766" /> investment under the scheme; for example marina services, cruiser hire, equestrian centre services and tour coach services.  In fact, the exclusion for the asset-backed sectors should operate to improve the chances that such ventures will, in fact, be able to raise funds for investment.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to make concerns the transitional arrangements I made in March.  They were a recognition that there were cases where binding contracts in writing had been entered into on or before budget day in anticipation of BES funds.  The wisdom of entering into binding written contracts in advance of securing the money to fund them is, of course, questionable, but it was to deal with the difficulties that would arise for companies, especially smaller companies, where such contracts existed that I announced these transitional arrangements. They are, however, transitional only; only a limited number of companies will be able to benefit from them, and only to the extent of £1 million per company less any BES funds already raised, and only where the shares are issued by 31 August.  This Government are not in the business of putting small businesses out of business and, consequently, I made the transitional changes to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>However, the budget measures remain; a lifetime cap has been imposed on investors, the company limit has been reduced from £2.5 million to £500,000, and shipping, hotels, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation are excluded from the scheme.  That is the position and so it will remain.</P>
    <P>I also want to deal with the view that the BES has done no good in the economy, and that it should have been abolished. A review of the scheme carried out by my Department, in conjunction with the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Tourism and Transport, and the Marine and the office of the Revenue Commissioners, makes clear that whatever the cause and effect additional jobs were arising in companies which raised BES funds.  It also threw light on the <Col N="767" /> question of where the BES was most costeffective which, in the final analysis, is the key question about any incentive scheme.</P>
    <P>The review covered 347 companies and identified some 4,250 additional jobs in those companies.  It identified State aid in respect to those companies of some £74 million, between tax foregone under the BES and direct State aid in the form of IDA grants.  This sectoral breakdown was as follows: 3,138 additional jobs were identified in 275 manufacturing and international services companies, which had received £36.9 million in BES investment at a tax foregone cost of £20 million approximately and £24.9 million in direct State aid.  One thousand additional jobs were identified in 63 tourism companies which had received £46.8 million in BES investment at a tax foregone cost of approximately £23.5 million.  Seventy-eight additional jobs were identified in four shipping companies which had received £7.7 million in BES investment at a tax foregone cost of £3.9 million, while 28 additional jobs were identified in five special trading houses which had received £3.3 million in BES investment at a tax foregone cost of £1.7 million.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is not possible to establish objectively to the exclusion to the element of judgment that State support &mdash; including low-cost finance under the BES &mdash; was directly the cause of the additional jobs identified.  Jobs growth is very likely to have reflected other influences as well, not least the favourable economic climate which has existed in recent years.  In addition, account was not taken of possible effects on non-BES companies, in the relevant sectors or otherwise.  Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that BES funding played some part.  It will also be noticed that there were significant variations across sectors in the level of additional jobs identified.  These considerations underpinned, although were not the exclusive or deciding factors in, the budget decisions taken on the BES.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains three sections relating specifically to income tax on farming.</P>
    <P>Section 10 increases the existing £2,000 <Col N="768" /> income tax exemption for lessors of farmland who are aged 55 years or over, or who are unable to carry on farming because of mental or physical infirmity. This measure is aimed at encouraging greater land mobility and enabling younger farmers to have the use of land for a reasonable period in order to plan ahead.  The new exemption limit will be £3,000 in the case of leases of at least five years duration and £4,000 where leases are for seven years or more.</P>
    <P>Section 23 continues, as an exceptional and temporary measure, the 50 per cent rate of accelerated capital allowances for certain expenditure incurred by farmers on the control of farmyard pollution, where such expenditure is incurred before 1 April 1993, and approved by the Minister for Agriculture and Food either under the scheme of investment aid for the control of farmyard pollution or the farm improvement programme.  The accelerated capital allowances will apply on a net-of-grant basis.  This special concession is intended to assist these farmers who avail of these schemes which protect the environment.  The existing scheme of stock relief, which is unique to the farming sector, is renewed for a further period of two years in section 16.</P>
    <P>The International Financial Services Centre has been a tremendous success story for this country.  So far, approximately 160 projects have been approved for the centre and companies have entered into definite employment commitments for almost 2,600 new jobs.  The Bill contains a number of provisions which will help ensure that the centre will continue to thrive.</P>
    <P>In the case of investment companies which have been designated by the Central Bank, section 17 provides for &ldquo;tax transparency&rdquo;, for example foreign investors will only be liable in their home countries for any tax due in respect of their shares in the income or gains of the company.  This brings them into line with similar investment vehicles, such as UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) and Unit Trusts.</P>
    <P>Section 102 of the Bill exempts from <Col N="769" /> companies' capital duty all investment companies to which the provisions of Part XIII of the Companies Act, 1990, relate. This exemption already applies to UCITS and it is considered appropriate that it should extend to other investment vehicles, to which Part XIII of the Companies Act 1990, relates, in the IFSC.</P>
    <P>Although insurance was one of the financial services listed for the IFSC in the Finance Act, 1987, life assurance business has not yet been attracted into the centre.  It has been suggested that the IFSC is at a disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> competitor centres because in Ireland the investment income of policyholders is liable to tax as well as the normal trading profits of the company, whereas continental countries do not operate this kind of taxation system.  A disadvantage also arises <i>vis-á-vis</i> other forms of savings products, such as UCITS and Unit Trusts, already operating in the IFSC, in respect of which &ldquo;tax transparency&rdquo; has already been granted.  Accordingly, I have included provisions in section 25 which will, I hope, ease the way for the entry of life assurance business, which has very significant employment potential, to the IFSC.  The effect of section 25 is that such companies transacting business with non-residents only will effectively enjoy tax exemption in relation to the income of policyholders, leaving such income to be taxed in the hands of the recipient, as is the norm amongst continental European countries.  The section also incorporates some precautions which are designed to ensure that shareholders' profits will be partially &ldquo;ring-fenced&rdquo; in order to preserve the tax due on these profits.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent rate of corporation tax is a vital part of the package which has been designed to attract business to the IFSC.  Originally, that incentive was due to expire on 31 December 2000.  Following agreement with the EC Commission, that date is now being extended under section 29 to 31 December 2005.  The period during which new projects may be approved for the IFSC has also been extended, from 31 December 1990 to 31 December 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> This is a major boost to the centre and will, I am sure, help to consolidate its future.  It is my earnest hope that many companies will take advantage of these extensions and move quickly to establish in the centre.  There is no doubt in my mind that the centre has an important part to play in the worldwide financial services industry and it is the Government's intention to ensure that it can continue to do so.</P>
    <P>As with the IFSC, the Bill also extends the expiry date for the Shannon 10 per cent tax rate from 31 December 2000 to 31 December 2005.  In addition, the provisions of sections 17 and 102, in relation to investment companies, will apply in the Shannon zone.</P>
    <P>In section 18, the National Treasury Management Agency, which was established on 3 December 1990, is being given an exemption from corporation tax and capital gains tax.  The agency is totally funded from, and carries out certain delegated functions for the Exchequer. Because any tax it would pay would in effect be funded by the Exchequer, the exemption avoids a circular transfer process. A corporation tax exemption is also being given to the pensions board. Section 35 provides for this.  The board are self-financing, with their administrative expenses being met by fees levied on pension funds.  Any surpluses arising to the board will be once-off or used to provide against unexpected expenditure. It would be inconsistent to tax the board's surpluses, derived from fees levied on pension funds which are themselves exempt from corporation tax.</P>
    <P>Section 19 closes a loophole in relation to the availability of double rent allowance to lessees in the urban renewal designated areas.  Under existing provisions, it would have been possible to obtain more than the intended ten-year span of relief.  This section limits lessees to a maximum of ten years.  The section affects rent payable on leases entered into on and from 18 April 1991, the date of publication of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 21 relaxes the current requirement that, for initial capital allowances <Col N="771" /> on buildings to be available to the purchaser, the buildings be unused when acquired.  These allowances will now be given if the buildings are sold within one year of being first used and the allowances have not alreay been claimed by any other person.  This change will help property developments, particularly in the designated areas, where the current commercial practice is frequently to sell buildings with tenants in occupation.</P>
    <P>Section 22 implements the budget proposal in relation to the use of capital allowances through certain property investment schemes.  These schemes were deliberately designed to maximise the short term use of the capital allowances available for the construction of buildings in the designated areas in an unintended and unacceptable way.  If appropriate action were not taken, the schemes would have led to a considerable front-loading of tax losses on the Exchequer in 1991 and subsequent years. Obviously I could not have permitted this.  Accordingly the section restricts the use of the capital allowances in question in the case of such schemes.</P>
    <P>The section has been carefully drafted to ensure that there will be no adverse effect on the normal type of joint investment in property which has taken place in recent years.  Thus the restrictions will not apply to schemes which are in accordance with a practice which commonly prevailed in the State in the five years to budget day 1991.  To take an example, where four individuals jointly purchase a new building in a designated area in the traditional way, it is intended that the associated capital allowances will continue to be available for set-off against all the income of each of these individuals for tax purposes.  The Revenue Commissioners will be prepared to express an opinion on the entitlement to capital allowances where requested to do so in any particular case.  Thus, a group of investors contemplating an acquisition or development in a designated area need be in no doubt about their position.</P>
    <P>Section 24 makes a number of changes <Col N="772" /> in the legislation governing the availability of domestic-sourced section 84 loans. The changes are in continuation of the general policy of widening the tax base and reducing the cost to the Exchequer of section 84 loans while, at the same time, providing transitional arrangements in the case of certain loans for new industrial projects.  The cost to the Exchequer is reduced through the lowering of the ceiling for new loans from 75 per cent to 40 per cent of the loan volume as at 12 April 1989, with effect from 31 December next.  This reduction takes account of the fact that about £500 million in loans to Shannon financial services companies will terminate on that date. The new 40 per cent ceiling will apply earlier in the case of any particular lender if any such Shannon loan of this lender terminates before 31 December next.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of section 84 loans is also being reduced by taxing the interest in the hands of the lender in the case of what are known as high-coupon loans.  These are loans in foreign currencies with high interest rates which are much more costly to the Exchequer than the ordinary IR£ loans.  The prohibition will operate through the taxation of the interest on section 84 loans in the hands of the lender where the interest rate exceeds 80 per cent of DIBOR.  To cater for the fact that the UK is still our major trading partner, sterling loans are excluded from the scope of this restriction.</P>
    <P>Transitional arrangements are being introduced in the case of loans for certain new manufacturing projects.  Where it is not possible for such loans to come within the new 40 per cent ceiling, the provisions permit the giving of these loans above the ceiling.  The 80 per cent of DIBOR rule will not apply to certain new loans for manufacturing companies where commitments had been given before budget day.</P>
    <P>Section 25 allows life assurance companies to amalgamate their ordinary and industrial branch funds for corporation tax purposes.  The 1989 Insurance Act permitted the amalgamation of these separate funds into a common fund for life <Col N="773" /> assurance policies.  This section brings the tax legislation into line with this.  In order to minimise the cost to the Exchequer, the past tax losses on industrial business are being ring-fenced so that they can be offset only against the future income from the industrial side of the business.</P>
    <P>Section 26 contains taxation provisions aimed at facilitating the securitisation of mortgages.  Securitisation is a special type of arrangement under which a bank or a building society effectively sells off a package of its mortgages through an intermediary to investors such as pension funds and life assurance companies. Securitisation will provide a new investment outlet in the State for pension funds and life assurance companies and will also provide the scope for extra mortgage finance for the banks and buildings societies. The borrower's consent will be required for the securitisation of the mortgage to take place and the borrower will continue in practice to have the same business relationship with the bank or building society as existed prior to the securitisation.</P>
    <P>Section 27 ensures that the standard rate of corporation tax will continue to apply in the case of the processing of meat which is sold into intervention.</P>
    <P>Section 30 extends from 2000 to 2010 the termination date for the special 10 per cent rate of corporation tax in the case of certain activities in line with the similar extension for manufacturing contained in last year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>Section 31 converts into domestic tax law the EC Directive on a common system of taxation for the distribution of profits from a subsidiary company in one EC country to their parent located in another member state.  This directive is part of a package of three measures on which agreement was reached during Ireland's EC Presidency after a delay of 21 years.  The other two measures are concerned with mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and exchanges of shares involving companies in different member states and with an arbitration procedure where there is disagreement between the Revenue authorities in different EC countries on a particular <Col N="774" /> double taxation question.  It is hoped to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage containing the provisions in the mergers directive.  The new arbitration convention will be dealt with by way of a Government Order in accordance with the normal practice for double taxation treaties.  The aim of section 31 is to ensure that the profits distributed by the subsidiary to its parent are not taxed by both the countries concerned.  Although the reliefs provided by section 31 already apply under existing double taxation treaties with the majority of our EC partners, the new provisions will extend the reliefs in the case of the remaining EC countries.</P>
    <P>The scope of the tax exemptions for pension funds was extended in the 1988 Finance Act to investment in financial futures and traded options in the State. Section 32 will now allow for similar treatment for such investment in foreign futures and options exchanges.  This change is appropriate in the context of 1992.</P>
    <P>In last year's Finance Act, a one-year tax relief was given for corporate donations to the Trust for Community Initiatives. The trust was set up by the business community as their response to my call for an initiative from them aimed at alleviating poverty and increasing employment. It promotes a wide range of community development projects throughout the country.  I have decided to renew the tax relief on company donations to the trust for one further year and section 33 provides for this.</P>
    <P>The main provisions in Chapter VI are to give effect to the introduction of self-assessment for capital gains tax, as announced in the budget.  This will bring capital gains tax into line with other taxes such as income tax, corporate tax and capital acquisitions tax, to which self-assessment already applies.  Capital gains tax will continue to be due in the year following that in which the disposal of the assets takes place.  Preliminary tax will be payable on 1 November in the tax year following the disposal of the assets, and the tax return will be due on the following <Col N="775" /> 31 January.  In order to avoid the possibility of an interest charge, preliminary tax must be at least 90 per cent of the full amount of the tax due for the year of assessment.  To help taxpayers and their agents adapt to the changeover, the Revenue Commissioners have produced an explanatory booklet on the measures as introduced.  This is being posted to taxpayers on their agents and is also available on request from tax offices.</P>
    <P>In addition to this major change, the Bill contains in Chapter V three proposals which will provide relief from capital gains tax in certain cases.  The first concerns the disposal of an asset, whether a business or a farm, on the retirement of the owner.  The threshold for relief on disposal of an asset outside the family is being raised from £50,000 to £200,000. The second proposal concerns the provisions governing the disposal of shares by a retiring director of a family company. The requirement that the individual making the disposal be a full-time working director for the ten years prior to the disposal is being eased.  The requirement in future will be that he or she has been a working director in the company for ten years of which five years must have been full-time.  Moreover, this time period need no longer be immediately prior to the disposal of the asset.  These changes will make it easier for people to retire from a business or farm and thus enable business and farms to pass to younger management.  They will also cater for people whose active involvement in a family company is curtailed by, for example, illness or disability.</P>
    <P>The third provision is being introduced to encourage private owners of works of art to lend them to galleries for display to the public.  When a work of art, worth over £25,000, has been on loan to an approved gallery for six years for display to the public, it will be exempt from capital gains tax on its subsequent disposal.</P>

      <P>Chapter VII deals with urban renewal measures, and in particular with the special package of incentives for the Temple Bar area.  The Government have chosen the renewal and development of Temple Bar as a flagship project in Dublin's specific contribution to mark its status as European City of Culture in 1991.  The aim is that the existing buildings in the Temple Bar area should be refurbished and conserved in a manner which maintains their character, that new construction will only be allowed where it complements the architecture of the area, and that the activities to be encouraged in the area will be those which are in sympathy with its ambience. In order to ensure that this happens, a special role is being given to Temple Bar Renewal Limited a company chaired by the Lord Mayor.  The approval of this company as to the appropriateness of the work involved will be necessary before refurbishment or new construction work can qualify for the specific tax reliefs, which will exist for a five year period, up until 5 April 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Temple Bar area is defined in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  Section 49 contains the details of the tax reliefs. In summary, these distinguish between expenditure on existing buildings, and that incurred on new buildings.  For existing commercial buildings, owner-occupiers can avail of a 100 per cent allowance for capital expenditure on refurbishment. This expenditure will include not only the actual refurbishment expenditure but <Col N="777" /> also the lesser of the cost of acquiring the building or the value of the building at 1 January 1991, provided that the expenditure on actual refurbishment is at least equal to this additional cost or value element. Where a lessor refurbishes a commercial building, a 50 per cent initial and 4 per cent annual allowance will be given. A 100 per cent allowance, as with commercial premises, will also be available to owner-occupiers who refurbish their residential buildings.</P>
    <P>For new commercial buildings, construction expenditure will attract a 50 per cent capital allowance for owner-occupiers. In the case of lessors, there will be a 25 per cent initial and 2 per cent annual allowances.  Lessees in both existing and newly-built commercial premises can also avail of double rent allowance.  Owner-occupiers of new residential buildings can avail of a 50 per cent tax allowance, at 5 per cent per year over ten 10.  Finally section 23 reliefs will apply to the construction of new residential premises and to the refurbishment and conversion of existing buildings.</P>
    <P>It is intended that a 100 per cent capital allowance will be provided for development of multi-storey car-parks in the Temple Bar area.  Where these car-parks are leased, a 50 per cent initial and 4 per cent annual allowance will apply.  In recognition of the need to integrate car-parks with the architecture of the area, they need not be free-standing.  This integration principle is also catered for in allowing apportionment of expenditure for tax relief purposes within a building which is partly commercial and partly residential.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections in this Chapter provide for the general urban renewal measures.  Section 50 extends the time-scale for section 23 reliefs on construction and conversion for a final year, up to 31 March 1992, in the non-designated areas. In the designated areas, these reliefs will last until 31 May 1993 and until 24 January 1993 in the Custom House Docks area.  As in the case of the special tax reliefs, they will be available until 5 April 1996 in the Temple Bar area.  This section <Col N="778" /> also removes the ring-fence on conversion expenditure incurred under the section 23 scheme in the designated areas including the Temple Bar area.  This means that such expenditure can in future be offset against all rental income whereas previously it could be offset only against rental income from the property in question.</P>
    <P>Section 51 provides a parallel extension for refurbishment expenditure under section 23, and for the removal of the ring-fence which applied to it on the same lines as in the previous section.</P>
    <P>Section 52 gives a similar relief where there is a conversion of a building not previously used as a dwelling into a single dwelling.</P>
    <P>Chapter VIII contains certain taxation provisions that are needed to complement the changes in the 1990 Companies Act which will allow companies to buy back their own shares.  The existing tax rules are designed to address arrangements under which profits are transferred to shareholders without payment of a dividend, thereby avoiding an income tax charge.  They treat the redemption of shares by a non-quoted company as a distribution of the company's profits to the shareholder, which renders the shareholder chargeable to income tax.</P>
    <P>These rules are now being relaxed, subject to certain anti-avoidance safeguards. Where the various conditions designed to prevent avoidance are met, the shareholder's gains on the buy back of shares of unquoted companies will be subject to capital gains tax, instead of income tax, treatment.  In general, this will mean a substantial reduction in the shareholder's tax liability in such situations and accordingly will facilitate shareholders in non-quoted companies who wish to dispose of their shares and terminate their connection with the company. Unlike the case of quoted companies, there has up to now been effectively no market in these unquoted shares.  The changes introduced by Chapter VIII will, by facilitating share buybacks by the companies, greatly increase the liquidity of the shares of these companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> Part II of the Bill &mdash; sections 67 to 69 &mdash; deals with customs and excise provisions. It implements the measures which I announced in the budget in relation to tobacco taxation, the concessions relating to liquified petroleum gas, including that for the horticultural industry, and the rationalisation and restructuring of road tax charges.  Provision is also made for the introduction of special low rates of annual road tax for veteran and vintage vehicles.</P>
    <P>Section 114 provides for a reduction in the level of adaptation required from 30 per cent to 20 per cent of the tax exclusive cost of the vehicle for qualification under the disabled passenger provisions of the disabled driver scheme.  A general review of the scheme of tax concessions available to disabled drivers and passengers is already in train.  On completion of the overall review, I will, of course, be consulting with the Opposition spokespersons in line with the undertaking that I previously gave in this House.  However, I consider that this change is desirable and since it requires specific amending legislation it would otherwise have to await the 1992 Bill.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill gives effect to the VAT changes announced in the budget as well as a number of further measures. The budget measures comprise the reduction of two percentage points in the standard rate to 21 per cent, the increase from 10 to 12.5 per cent on certain low rated goods and services, the extension of the provisions regarding certain categories of accommodation in the interest of creating greater equity in the sector, the taxation of certain non-postal services of An Post, and the application of VAT to the services of veterinary surgeons as required by EC law.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on budget day, the net effect of the VAT rates changes is to return £37 million to consumers.  This figure makes a nonsense of the suggestion that householders will be worse off on account of these changes.  It should, in any case, be plain that the cost of many everyday purchases will benefit from the further cut in the main VAT rate, given <Col N="780" /> its very wide scope.  Though some increases in the reduced-rate areas were needed to partly fund this reduction, the necessity for significant restructuring, if our VAT code is to be brought into line with the requirements of the EC Single Market, has long been apparent.  The considerable progress we have made in this regard over the past two budgets has reduced significantly the incentive for tax inspired cross-Border shopping.  It also played a key role in making possible the liberalisation of travellers' allowances recently put in place.</P>
    <P>The other VAT measures are mainly technical in nature.  The group registration facility, which allowed Revenue to treat two or more taxable persons as one accountable person in the interests of efficiency, is being extended to cater for VAT exempt bodies.  This change, which is provided for in sections 73, 77 and 78, accords with evolving requirements in the business sector.  Section 75 is intended to allow deduction of VAT on services like solicitors' fees incurred where a business is transferred from one taxable person to another.  In section 79, subsection (a) (i), I am bringing national law into line with EC VAT law so that the assignment or transfer of debts and receivables is exempt from the tax.  Finally, in subsection (a) (ii) of the same section, I am updating the existing VAT law on unit trusts to take account of recent legislation affecting investment undertakings.  No substantive amendment to existing practice is being made.</P>
    <P>The bank levy is renewed for a further year in section 83.  The amount of the levy is unchanged at £36 million.</P>
    <P>The law on stamp duty is very much out-of-date and the Bill provides for an extensive modernisation and rationalisation of the code.  Up to this, there has been no compulsion on the parties to an instrument to have it stamped and pay the duty due.  Enforcement of stamp duty has thus relied primarily on the fact that an instrument has no legal status unless it is stamped.  While the great majority of instruments that should be stamped are stamped as required, there is evidently undue opportunity for avoidance.  In <Col N="781" /> addition, the penalties for evasion have not been changed for 100 years and are consequently of limited effectiveness as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>Sections 87 to 101 of the Bill provide that stamp duty becomes a compulsory tax, thus putting it on the same footing as other taxes.  It sets out who is liable to pay the tax.  In most cases the buyer will continue to be responsible for payment; in other cases, the parties to the instrument will be liable.  The Bill also provides that all relevant information pertaining to an instrument be made available to the Revenue Commissioners and that the Revenue Commissioners may make an assessment of the tax due.  Existing penalties are updated, and new penalties are introduced where they are made necessary by the altered legal status of the tax. A new offence of negligence is introduced, a concept imported from the existing CAT code.  The Revenue Commissioners are given powers to enforce payment of the tax, in line with their powers in other taxation areas, including making the Revenue sheriffs responsible for collecting debts, where necessary.</P>
    <P>It has come to my attention that, under current legislation, it may be worthwhile for parties to large mortgages to have the instrument stamped outside the State. Part of the reason for this is the fact that the stamp duty on mortgages is currently capped at £3,000.  In order to help our financial services industry, to ensure that work will be carried out here which up to now could be sent abroad, and to capture revenue for the benefit of Irish taxpayers, I am reducing this cap to £500.</P>
    <P>Section 103 provides that the personal representative of a dead person be liable for residential property tax.  This is to enable outstanding tax be collected from the estate of a deceased owner.</P>
    <P>The Bill puts into effect the changes in capital acquisitions tax announced in the budget.  The top tax rate is reduced to 40 per cent.  Various reliefs, outlined in the budget, are detailed in the Bill.  Agricultural relief goes up to 55 per cent of the market value of the property, while retaining the maximum of £200,000, and <Col N="782" /> the conditions are amended to focus the relief more clearly on the situation where a farm is transferred to a working farmer.</P>
    <P>In the case of a person aged 55 or over who inherits a house or part of a house from a brother or sister with whom he or she has been living for the previous five years, the value of the house will be reduced by £50,000 or 50 per cent, whichever is the lesser, for tax purposes.  This measure should provide significant relief to a group of taxpayers who can have difficulties meeting their tax bills under current legislation.  The Bill also provides for the extension of the Class A threshold to inheritances taken by a parent from a child.  Again this measure is to alleviate hardship, and only a small number of cases are expected to benefit.  The measure is backdated to 1982, to cover all known cases.  This is an issue that arose in discussions on the Final Stages of the Finance Bill last year where a father had passed on his farm to his son who was later tragically killed in an accident.  All the tax had been paid and consequently the question arose of the same amount of tax being paid in transferring the farm back to the father.  That is what this provision is all about.  I said at the time I would introduce such a provision in this year's Finance Bill and backdate it.</P>
    <P>Sections 111 and 112 give effect to the tax amnesty for CAT and death duties announced in the budget.  The new enforcement measures, which will come into force following the amnesty, are provided for in sections 118 and 119 of the Bill.  These include extending the Revenue Commissioners' powers of attachment and giving the Revenue sheriffs power to collect CAT liabilities.  These measures will be rigorously enforced.</P>
    <P>The Bill as usual contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, some of which I have already mentioned.  Section 113 contains the usual provision relating to the capital services redemption account. Section 115 and the Fourth Schedule apply to revenue offences the same procedures for the collection of fines imposed by the courts as for non-revenue offences.  Section 116 is a technical <Col N="783" /> amendment required to facilitate the proposed relocation outside Dublin of certain offices of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In this opening address I have outlined for Deputies the Government's approach to general economic issues as well as detailing the more significant elements of the Bill.  I look forward to the opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss in more detail the individual sections of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is the first in the House and should be noted. The Finance Bill is a monument to failure. The Government are seeking a statutory framework for a budget which has already failed; a budget which is increasing unemployment well beyond 250,000 on the live register; a budget which is failing to meet its own limited targets, which is reducing confidence and guaranteeing high interest rates; a budget which again fails to reform income tax, which ensures that the PAYE worker will continue to carry an overwhelming burden; a budget which clearly illustrates the paralysis of the Government and the growing conflict between the Coalition partners leading to a total inability to take decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Finance Bill underpins the failures <Col N="784" /> of the Government; where it breaks new ground it merely provides extra means for avoiding tax.  I do not believe that a further extension to the tax dodgers' charter is necessarily good for the country. Even though the budget was announced only 11 weeks ago it is now substantially off the rails and the Minister will have great difficulty in achieving his budgetary targets.  Even though he has been very confident about achieving them in statements in recents days, the section of his speech today which dealt with that matter is far less sanguine.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer returns for the first quarter support this view; Exchequer borrowing for the first three months of the year, at £499 million, was £39 million greater than the estimate for the year as a whole.  Receipts under almost all tax headings &mdash; especially indirect taxes &mdash; are below what was estimated.  Those who defend the budget say &mdash; and I quote from one of them: &ldquo;The greater part of the Government borrowing is usually undertaken in the first quarter of any year&rdquo;.  While this has been so in recent years there is no written &mdash; or unwritten &mdash; law which requires this.  The distribution of Government borrowing in any year is not predetermined but depends on the type of budget introduced by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>When budgets cut public expenditure and increase taxes &mdash; we had a number of these in recent years &mdash; then it is to be expected that a disproportionate tranche of borrowing takes place in the early part of the year.  This is because it takes some time to put the expenditure reductions in place in the line Departments and the extra taxes, with the exception of excise and a month of VAT returns, do not come into effect until the start of the tax year in April.  Consequently, in that type of budget, a disproportionate amount of borrowing takes place in the first quarter but that is not the type of budget which was announced on the last day of January this year.</P>
    <P>When we have a budget along the lines of this year's budget, when it actually increases public expenditure and when its taxation measures are either neutral or <Col N="785" /> expansionary, then there is no valid reason to expect matters to improve later in the year.  We saw this in budgets of the late seventies which were along these lines.  We saw that a bad first quarter was followed by a worse second quarter, leading to a realisation in the third quarter that the budget was off the rails. Then we had a lot of wringing of hands and wondering whether there would be supplementary budgets.  It was then politically decided to leave well enough alone because, when we were going into the fourth quarter, it was not worth doing anything until the following budget and the next financial year.  I am very much afraid this is the kind of budget we now have, where matters will get progressively worse as the year proceeds.  If this happens the Government have only themselves to blame.  The assumptions on which the budget was based were far too optimistic and the chickens are now coming home to roost.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any independent commentator who believes that the economy will grow by 2.25 per cent this year.  If this increase in growth is not achieved, then the increase in revenue estimated to arise from this growth cannot be achieved either.  We also know that unemployment is &mdash; and will continue to be &mdash; far higher than estimated by the Minister.  Extra social welfare payments will cost approximately £35 million and the estimated increase in income tax and PRSI receipts from higher employment will not be realised as employment goes down.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the Finance Bill has taken no step to correct this; as a matter of fact, he has made his budgetary position worse by failing to implement some of the budgetary announcements.  I refer in particular to his failure to implement the restrictions he announced on the business expansion scheme, a reversal of policy which, I understand, will cost the Exchequer £17 million approximately.</P>
    <P>This week we are involved in a very ironic exercise; we are giving a statutory framework to a budget which has already failed and the Minister does not have a single proposal to rectify the position. There is very little attempt to reform <Col N="786" /> taxation, in particular income tax, in this Finance Bill.  Some further progress has been made in reducing the top and standard rates of income tax and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Programme</i> makes a commitment to further reducing the standard rate in the next two budgets.  Any advantage to the taxpayer, however, is cancelled by increasing or eliminating the income ceiling on certain levies, by not indexing certain allowances and bands &mdash; or under-indexing them &mdash; or by the failure to increase certain bands by the full rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Most PAYE workers find our tax system complex; they are not particularly interested in how their tax is deducted but they are interested in how much is deducted and, in particular, how much take-home pay is left after all deductions are made.  Trying to convince people that paying the same amount of income tax &mdash; or extra income tax &mdash; assessed in a different way is to their benefit is a totally futile exercise.  Our tax system has many faults but there are also many misconceptions about it.  We are not a particularly highly taxed country despite the conventional belief.  The burden of taxation is about average for the EC.  We are, however, a very high income taxed country because the tax base is narrow and the PAYE taxpayer, in particular, carries a greater burden than in other Community countries.</P>
    <P>The standard rate of income tax is not particularly high in Ireland, at 29 per cent.  The problem is that average income is not taxed at the standard rate and about 40 per cent of taxpayers pay tax at either the 48 per cent or the 53 per cent rates, and frequently at both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The disincentive to work is not because the standard rate of income tax is 29 per cent instead of 27 per cent or 25 per cent; it is because people on quite modest incomes &mdash; particularly single people &mdash; pay tax at the higher rates.  The overtime, Christmas bonus, pay increase, promotion and the increment are all taxed at 48 per cent or 53 per cent; this is the real disincentive, not whether the standard rate is one penny more or one penny less. The difference between our income tax regime and that of our neighbours is the fact that the higher rates apply on modest incomes, that almost 40 per cent of workers pay tax at the higher rates and that single persons pay tax at the higher rates on what are, in effect, starting salaries. That is worth repeating, single people pay tax at the higher rates on what are, in effect, starting salaries.  When they come straight out of school or college, they pay 48 per cent on their first increment. This is the disincentive to work which is destroying the work ethic for many people; this is what causes voluntary emigration which is highly selective and is driving the skilled young to countries where they are not tyrannised by tax.  Despite record high unemployment, there are now shortages in some skilled jobs emerging in the economy for this reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the key factor in the sorry state of our income tax code is the low level of income at which all the rates commence rather than the level of the marginal rate applying to the individual taxpayer.  The low paid should not be taxed and those on moderate incomes should be taxed at the standard rate on all their taxable income.  The higher rate should apply only to a very small minority of highly paid individuals.  To be specific, I believe that no more than 10 per cent of taxpayers should pay tax at a rate higher than the standard rate.  Some people, especially married men with four or more children, cannot afford to return <Col N="788" /> to work because they make more money on social welfare than they possibly could on a net income after tax deductions and PRSI.  One of the reasons for this is that income tax starts at too low an income and the standard rate, together with PRSI, is too sudden a shock to the income of the low paid.</P>
    <P>A strong case can be made for a commencement rate of tax which is far less than the standard rate of tax.  Some progress will be made by exempting the low paid, but even when those exemptions are put in place, the jump from that level of income to a deduction of 29 per cent plus 7.75 per cent in PRSI is too steep and too sudden at too low a level of income.  I would advocate that the Minister, as well as having a higher rate and a standard rate of tax, would seriously consider having a commencement rate of tax which would ease people into the tax net so that they are not faced with this sudden bang when they go through a particular income barrier which is a very low barrier that they have to break through before they are taxed at this high rate.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is futile to make these arguments to the Government.  Their course is set.  It has been agreed with the social partners.  The taxpayers' money will be taken from one pocket of the taxpayer to be put into the other pocket of the same taxpayer.  Marginal rates will be reduced because that commitment has been made and, I am sure, will be insisted upon by the junior partners in coalition; and PAYE people will continue to be frustrated.  There will be no tax reform but there will be attempts by various spokespersons on behalf of the two parties in Government to create the illusion that a total concentration on the reduction of the marginal rate of tax is somehow or other a major tax reform and that it is the trigger which will release dynamism in the economy and lead to growth, wealth creation and the creation of jobs.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is not <Col N="789" /> an illusion but a delusion which is propagated day in and day out particularly by the former Deputy who has been mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte.  It is a fallacy it is populist rhetoric aimed at high income earners.  It has little enough to do with the real economy.  I do not think there is a basis to the argument in terms of incentives to work or in terms of leverage in the economy.  It is populist rhetoric which does not bear up to any analysis.</P>
      <P>The problem is clear to any of us who are practicing politicians.  It is as I have outlined.  I know there is agreement on that among the Deputies over here and I am sure they will refine the arguments further because I am giving them at the level of principle.  The key to the tax problem in this country is that PAYE people are paying too much and that the higher rates are kicking in at too low a level of income so that people on very low incomes who should not be paying tax at all are in the tax net.  When they are brought in, the standard rate plus PRSI is too high an introductory level, and the conclusions that follow from that are fairly obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil on a number of occasions.  I refer to them because I know the Progressive Democrats will agree with the Government in Government and then will publicly complain in the most hypocritical fashion that their policies are not being implemented. Almost since their foundation the Progressive Democrats have been advocationg low marginal tax rates as a trigger to a more vital and vigorous economy. They have, however, ignored the kind of arguments I have just presented and have always fudged on exactly how their tax proposals will be paid for.  Their chairman, I believe, has a genuine commitment to tax reform and he argues in favour of lower rates, fewer allowances and a broadening of the tax base.  I wonder which allowances he is talking about.  Could he be more specific? I am sure the Minister can give an estimate of what it would cost to get us down to the <Col N="790" /> 40 per cent suggested in the headline in the morning paper.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This Bill does not broaden the tax base.  It restricts it by the provision of a whole new raft of allowances in respect of the Temple Bar and the Custom House Docks developments. The type of allowances and reliefs provided are those most inimical to tax reform in that they are available, broadly speaking, only to the wealthy and, in the case of the Custom House Docks site, the super wealthy.  I know of nothing more inimical to tax reform, more contrary to the interests of the ordinary PAYE worker and more cynical as a budgetary manoeuvre than the provision of a range of new reliefs and allowances which can be availed of only by the wealthy.  It leads to a situation where the poor pay tax and the rich avoid it.  We have had an example of that in every Finance Bill since 1987, but the provisions in this Finance Bill reach a new low. How can it be just, honest or honourable to allow tax relief if only 25 or 30 individuals are involved in a project but to rule it out if it is open to the general public? The advancement of certain projects by <Col N="791" /> means of tax relief has frequently been tried.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not, but there is always a price to be paid.  We need to measure this price in terms of the tax foregone far more precisely than we did in the past.  The changes which the Minister introduced in the BES two years ago cost the taxpayer about £50 million with little return to show for it in terms of jobs or economic activity.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The rafts of further tax breaks introduced in this Finance Bill are also overcooked and will lead to a substantial loss of revenue for a doubtful return.</P>
      <P>I would like now to turn to what I consider to be the greatest problem facing our people, the problem of unemployment. The level of unemployment is now an absolute disgrace.  On the live register are more than 246,000 persons. From this month those over 58 years of age will not be obliged to sign on so there will be a further massaging of the figures from the end of April.  Up to 30,000 persons are involved in courses of one kind or another.  The real level of unemployment now is somewhere up against 300,000.  Yet there is not a single measure in this Bill which deals specifically with the problem or changes the situation one iota.  Employment is a function of growth.  Growing economies create jobs; declining economies lose jobs.  In the ten months up to budget day the seasonally adjusted live register had risen by 12,700 to a figure of 232,400.  That is almost a six per cent increase for the ten months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the budget the pace of unemployment has continued and the live register at the end of March was 246,515.  The <Col N="792" /> seasonally adjusted figure was 242,800. The Government, and in particular the Minister for Finance, estimated on budget day an average unemployment figure for the year of 228,000 and the amount of money for the Department of Social Welfare was based on this estimate. This would require a drop of about 6 per cent in unemployment between now and December.  Is it likely that unemployment, which has risen by two-thirds of 1 per cent for each month of the last 12 months, will suddenly turn around for no reason and begin to decline at a rate unprecedented in our recent history, especially when there is no evident change in external circumstances? Even today the Minister said that the authorities in the UK are revising their figures downwards from a modest projection of 2 per cent growth to 0 per cent.  How can we have a decline in unemployment when external factors are worse than they were on budget day in the United Kingdom and the United States of America and when the newly acquired state of East Germany is putting further pressure on what used to be the engine of growth in Europe, the German economy? Yet there is nothing in the Finance Bill nor was there anything in the budget which changes domestic policy.  If policy is not changing abroad or at home how can things get better?</P>
    <P>When Deputy FitzGerald spoke on the budget a week after it was introduced he pointed out that the estimate of growth by the Minister was below the level which normally creates jobs.  He made a very good point which is worth repeating: with output per worker in this country rising annually at about 3 per cent on average, a 2.25 per cent growth rate implies a reduction in jobs rather than an increase in jobs.  People think that jobs can be created at any level of growth because it is extra but one cannot create jobs if the growth is being created by the extra productivity of an intelligent work force. Thank God we have a hard-working and intelligent work force.  It is clear that one has to at least exceed a level of 2.25 per cent growth if one is to create jobs.  If the growth rate falls significantly short of the <Col N="793" /> Minister's estimate, then there will be a far more serious decline in jobs than I think the Minister believes or yet realises. The live register figures are already bearing this out.  I would not be surprised if the seasonally adjusted figures exceeded 250,000 by December.</P>
    <P>As I have said, growth creates jobs and anything which impedes growth costs jobs.  Therefore, it is worth looking at what creates and impedes growth in this country.  Investment creates growth in jobs.  The Minister is a successful businessman and he knows that people invest to make money.  That is how a market economy works.  It is very difficult to make money when real interest rates are at the astronomical level they are at present.  The A overdraft rate is 15.75 per cent and the inflation rate is about 2.75 per cent.  Therefore, the real rate of interest for the ordinary borrower is 13 per cent.  In other words, an investor who invests borrowed money must make 13 per cent for the bank before he can make £1 for himself.  That is a tall order.  An investor who invests his own money has a choice of putting it into Government paper at whatever the prevailing rate is but he can sit by the fire and be sure that he will make at least 10 per cent, which is 7.25 per cent above the rate of inflation. He is making a real gain and letting his money grow while sitting at the fire.  Why would such an investor take a risk in investing in the economy when the real rate of interest for the small man, farmers, shopkeepers and small businessmen, is 15.75 per cent?</P>
    <P>Anyone who wonders why we have low growth rates at present or why, as the Minister put it in his speech, investment is weaker than it was in recent years must put the astronomical interest rates at the top of the league table when looking for a culprit.  Is it any wonder that business activity is in decline?  Yet the Minister for Finance has no policy to reduce interest rates.  If we ask the specific question, a Cheann Comhairle, you will rightly advise that it is not the function of the Minister and the question will not be answered in the House: we are told that <Col N="794" /> the Central Bank has the statutory authority to set interest rates.  There is a pretence that the Minister can do nothing except, of course, when there is a 0.25 per cent reduction and he, like the cavalry, rides over the nearest hill, charges down and says &ldquo;I was the man who reduced them&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;for one reason or another.  This is inhibiting investment and, consequently, growth. We need high growth rates to deliver on jobs.  Therefore, there is an unbreakable link between high interest rates and joblessness and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asked for a solution to the problem.  He always pleads that he can do nothing about interest rates and that he is dragged along in the wake of international events.  I want to suggest two things the Minister could do.  First, he could insist that the margin between deposit rates and lending rates is cut right across the spectrum of interest rates.  This margin is the highest in any banking system in the EC.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have direct responsibility in this area.  When are we going to get the kind of competition we need in the banking industry so that the gap between what <Col N="797" /> the depositor and the lender get is narrowed down to what prevails in neighbouring countries?  That is the first thing the Minister should do.  That is not the job of the Central Bank; that is the job of the Government and, in particular, the job of the Minister for Industry an Commerce.  It is the job of the Minister for Finance, as he said here previously, to ensure that the Minister for industry and Commerce does his job in relation to competition in the banking industry, which he is not doing at present.</P>
    <P>The second thing the Minister could do is create the fiscal background to enable the Central Bank to reduce interest rates. In reply to Deputy Quinn's intervention the Minister suggested that vast amounts of money would run out of the country if he was to reduce interest rates, against the background of the budget 11 weeks ago, against the background of the Book of Estimates and the Finance Bill.  However, with a different fiscal background, as the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Maurice Doyle reminded him on a number of occasions, it would be possible to bring Irish interest rates down.</P>
    <P>The Minister has singularly failed in his fiscal policy this year to set the background for lower interest rates.  The Minister set soft budgetary targets.  His budget is already off the rails.  The discipline which was maintained until the 1989 election has been abandoned; expenditure is rising at an amount greater than inflation in virtually all Departments and the public pay bill is totally out of control. The wage agreement introduced under the PESP is only three months old and already today's ESB strike in pursuit of a 5 per cent wage increase against a complex background looks like knocking the wage agreement clean out of the water.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank cannot cut interest rates against this background.  They can rise and fall with international interest rates but the bank cannot take a unilateral initiative unless the Minister provides the policy context against which they can operate, so that the money the Minister talks about does not flow out of the country.</P>
    <P>Investment creates growth and jobs. <Col N="798" /> Investment will not take place and business confidence will be dissipated when the Minister and his Government manage the national accounts in the manner in which they have been managed since late August 1989.</P>
    <P>The Minister's phoney budget and this time serving Finance Bill has undermined confidence and there is a widespread belief that we are returning to the slippery slope of previous Haughey and O'Malley Governments when expenditure went out of control to the extent that it set the agenda for a whole series of problems over a decade.  Is there any one so naive as to think that the report in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that the Exchequer borrowing requirement continues to rise well in excess of the Estimate for the full year does not damage confidence, does not keep interest rates up, does not reduce investment and does not cost jobs?  It says in page 12 of today's edition of <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>The tax and spending figures for the year to mid-April show an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £720 million, some £190 million ahead of the same months in 1990.  The borrowing requirement appears to have been artificially inflated due to the Easter break, which postponed some significant tax receipts, but financial analysts say that they confirm that the Exchequer borrowing level for the full year is heading significantly above the £460 million budget target.</P>

I would nor rely unduly on the Estimates of the Department of Finance or any of the key figures because their record is not good.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am in order and have been since the start.  The information I quoted from page 12 of today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, I presume, was provided by the Minister's Department to the financial editor of <i>The Irish Times.</i> Because it is put in such categoric terms and in such exactitude of figures, I cannot believe it is not information passed on by the Department for <Col N="801" /> publication in <i>The Irish Times.</i> I quoted that in support of my argument that the figures published for the first quarter show that the borrowing requirement is well in excess of the budgetary target. According to <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning the figure continues to remain in excess of the estimated budgetary target and is actually increasing as the months go by.</P>
      <P>If it were not for the availability of the Structural Funds, if it were not for the expenditure of significant amounts of EC money from the Structural Funds, our economy would now be in recession.  I am using the term in the manner which the Minister, at Question Time last week, said he understood it; I am using it in the real sense.  We would have had negative growth for two successive quarters.  The only thing keeping growth above that is the intervention of EC Structural Funds. Left to our own devices we would now be in recession.  That costs jobs, and it will continue to cost jobs.  I have heard nothing from any of the economic Ministers, who share the burden with the Minister for Finance, which suggests that there is any solution to the problem of unemployment, or that the Government are in any way seriously addressing the issue with a set of coherent policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strong domestic demand can create jobs if that demand is satisfied by home production.  Reports from different sectors of the economy, for example from the building industry tell me that apart from schemes which are being completed, house building has virtually stopped in the major cities.  The representatives of the motor car industry have told me that the number of cars sold during the first three months of the year is seriously below the figure for the equivalent period last year.  Representatives of the general retail sector have also told me that their sales are down.  All this would seem to indicate a decline rather than an upsurge and the prospect of a poor tourist season, given the absence of American tourists in the wake of the Gulf War, will accentuate that trend.  The Minister confirmed this in his speech. <Col N="802" /> When he pointed out that investment is weakening he also said that consumer expenditure is weakening, which means less demand, more redundancies, more job losses and a further decline.</P>
    <P>Real tax reform also creates jobs but neither party in Government have any interest in real tax reform.  Therefore we need not expect the energy and dynamism which characterises the Irish abroad to be released by tax reform at home.  The Progressive Democrats continue as they did when they were in Opposition &mdash; talking tough and voting soft, making populist press releases but carefully avoiding, as they always did, to explain how their populist promises would be funded.  Yes, real tax reform would create jobs but we are not going to get it from the Government.</P>
    <P>A reduction in the standard rate of VAT and excise duty would also create jobs.  Good progress was made in respect of VAT reductions last year and it has been continued this year.  It is now clear, however, that the Minister does not intend to do much more.  The United Kingdom budget raised excise and VAT levels both there and in Northern Ireland and we will not find it difficult to approximate to their rates.  The Minister's sights now seem to be firmly set on the approximation of rates rather than on the harmonisation of taxes.  There will be little play left if the Minister intends to move to a point where we are within 2.5 per cent of the United Kingdom rate.  This approach will prevent potential job losses but it will not create new jobs.  I ask the Minister to raise his sights once more and to look for harmonisation of indirect taxation between ourselves and the United Kingdom rather than move to a position where taxes are approximated to avoid a distortion of trade patterns.</P>
    <P>The uncertainty surrounding the GATT talks is also undermining confidence in agriculture and the food industry and the sector looks like losing jobs rather than creating them.  In the light of the foregoing, is it not fair to ask what Government policy on jobs is?  There is neither a macro-economic nor a sectoral approach to the problem.  Nobody in <Col N="803" /> Government seems to be responsible for job creation and the social partners have little interest in the subject.  Have the Government in their hearts, adopted the approach of the former Tánaiste, Deputy Lenihan, who in a modest proposal in 1987 advocated the export of our surplus population?  This post-Famine strategy worked during the past few years but I am afraid that the Government can no longer rely on it.  Recession in the United States and the United Kingdom and the influx of young east Europeans to the Community have spoiled this strategy.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, once said that a Government who presided over a live register in excess of 100,000 should not continue in office and should not be re-elected.  I wonder what he thinks of the 246,000 persons who are on the live register now, especially that his <i>bete noire</i>, Deputy Haughey, and his protégé, Deputy O'Malley, jointly hold the reins of Government?  A leading British politician recently said that a Government who were unable to choose were unable to govern.  I think the budget and this Finance Bill shows up a Government who are unable to choose and, consequently, are unable to govern.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the specifics of the Finance Bill on Committee Stage but I would like to comment on two sets of provisions, one relating to the Temple Bar project and the other to the Custom House Dock site.  I have no objection to the development of specific projects being levered by tax incentives.  I believe, however, that the ones in this Finance Bill are excessive.  The Minister has not learned his lesson from his misguided extension of the business expansion scheme.  These tax driven schemes cost the Exchequer huge amounts of money. Tax foregone is as real a cost to the Exchequer and potentially as great an imposition on the taxpayer as any other element of public expenditure.  It is not a free lunch for the taxpayer and should not be undertaken without a careful cost benefit analysis.  Those who avail of these schemes argue &mdash; at times there is merit in this argument &mdash; that the schemes are <Col N="804" /> self-financing as the business activity created yields sufficient revenue to compensate for the tax foregone.  This, in one way or another, is the argument always put forward by those seeking extensions to such schemes.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to schemes where the tax relief available is tied to the investment in the project or the rental income arising from the development.  I do object, however, to schemes where taxable income derived from activities in no way connected with the particular investment can be offset against the cost and/or the rental income from a project in the designated area.  I have no objection to investors getting a tax break if a risk is taken and the project in question is in either the local or national interest. I do object however when the tax break is confined to certain people and not available to the general taxpayer.  I also object when the projects which are funded one way or another by public money are shrouded in such secrecy that no evaluation of the net benefit is possible and one cannot distinguish between the transfer of business activity from other areas into the designated area and the creation of new business.</P>
    <P>The initial urban renewal scheme introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition was very successful in Cork, Limerick and Galway but less successful in Dublin. It has, because of its success, led to numerous extensions and in many cases to limits which are no longer beneficial. Before any further extensions are made a full cost benefit analysis of what has already occurred should be carried out. The extension which took place in my city of Limerick where a further 40 acres were designated had no beneficial effect. In fact, it brought about a situation where development of the final six acres of the area originally designated did not proceed as the date was extended and new options were given in another part of town.  Therefore rather than giving us another tranche of development it marked the end of the initial tranche.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> One of the difficulties is that if a tax driven scheme is applied everywhere or if it is applied over too many areas it is of no use.  Its value is its scarcity value and we must be very careful to ensure that the areas designated are matched with the amount of potential development.  There is only a given quantum of development which can take place at any given time. Therefore, to a large extent, one is involved in the transfer of activity from one part of the country to another or from one part of the city to another or in the amalgamation of development so that the sum of the parts gives a new totality and the whole is greater than the sum of the parts if spread right throughout the city. All this is good but it must be measured very carefully.</P>
      <P>The ultimate folly, the kind of development levered by tax breaks, is the famous office block in London&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;Centre Point which remained idle and empty for many years.  Such a development arises when there is no connection between the tax break and the investment.  In other words, the Minister's proposals to allow people to write off taxable income arising from activities anywhere in the State or, indeed, elsewhere against the investment in the Temple Bar area could in certain circumstances lead to empty buildings.  You will get the development all right but whether you will get the desired activity I do not <Col N="806" /> know.  It is also very hard to measure how much tax is foregone by the Exchequer in schemes such as this.  There is always a net sum which needs to be worked out. Would the Exchequer or the Government get a better return for their money if they had a carefully directed grant system as against a tax foregone scheme? We are all familiar with the arithmetic of these things.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they do not.  The initial urban renewal scheme worked very well; the later ones are not working.  Certain aspects of the BES reached a state of high farce where nothing happened; balance sheets were changed around, there was no economic activity, no jobs were created, but the Exchequer lost hand over fist.</P>
      <P>While we all welcome the Temple Bar development and would like to see the kind of activity people talk about in that general area of the city, the number of tax breaks now being loaded into this Finance Bill is excessive.  I presume, because of this we will get a great deal of activity going in the Temple Bar area, but I think we will never be able to calculate the price.</P>
      <P>I would like to return to the question of income tax.  In times of high interest such as we have could the Minister not see his way to restore full mortgage interest relief to relieve some of the burden on persons with high mortgages, especially young couples who are finding it so hard to make ends meet?  I would like the Minister to tell us also if he shares the belief of the Chairman of the Progressive Democrats that mortage interest relief, VHI relief, the PAYE allowance and all other reliefs should be considered appropriate for abolition to get the top rate of tax down to 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on some of the Minister's statements.  First, I thank him for dealing in great detail with some of the more technical sections in the Finance Bill.  That is of benefit to all of us in the House and certainly to the accountancy and tax profession outside this House who are not sure of the parameters of a particular section and would <Col N="807" /> in the normal course of events quite frequently have to wait until the end of Committee Stage to get a definition of amendments.  The Minister has supplied that definition for the more complicated sections today.  I welcome that and I congratulate him on taking this approach.</P>
    <P>I thank him also for two other proposals in the Finance Bill.  Last year at the end of Report Stage the Minister agreed to take on board an amendment on inheritance tax where in tragic circumstances a son or daughter dies and the estate has to be retransferred, this time from the child back to the parents after it had been transferred initially and had been liable for the full rate of gift tax.  The Minister promised to look at this.  I think the circumstances were that he had agreed to take the amendment but the Attorney General was not prepared to clear it at the very short notice he gave him between Report Stage and Final Stage. This year the Minister has kept his word and not alone has introduced the amendment requested but has backdated it to 1982 which, as far as I know, includes all the cases which were surrounded with tragedy which we had in mind.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister also for accepting this year another amendment we argued first last year, again to do with capital acquisitions tax and inheritance tax between brothers and sisters living together.  I think the Minister is confining this relief to transfers to a recipient over 55 years of age.  The Minister might look at the age between now and Committee Stage to see if there is any valid reason for pitching the age at 55 or if it could be done at a lower age.  In normal circumstances it would not occur anyway until later stages in life as it requires a first and a subsequent transfer before the anomaly is thrown up between brothers and sisters.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister also for the provision he has included to alter the disabled driver's scheme.  I understand why he had to act in the Finance Bill rather than wait for the promised discussions between the Finance spokespersons, but I think rather than waiting until the 1992 <Col N="808" /> Finance Bill it was important to include it.  It will be of benefit.  I welcome also the fact that the Minister has reaffirmed his commitment to have discussions with all spokespersons for the parties on the general disabled driver's scheme.  I presume the amendments many of us are seeking can be implemented by alterations to the regulations and we will not have to wait until the 1922 Finance Bill to bring about the amendments we seek.</P>
    <P>In his remarks on VAT the Minister said there was a real return of income to the consumer of £37 million in the balance between reducing the standard rate and increasing the lower rate of VAT. Will the Minister in his reply try to identify which consumers are benefiting?  The normal basket of goods is not a standard basket across households with different incomes, and it seems that items which would be charged at the standard rate would be over-represented in the shopping baskets of the well off and under-represented in the shopping baskets of the poor, while other items at the lower rate might cut a wider swathe.  I would like the Minister to comment on that point.  While I agree there may be a net benefit to the VAT payer to the tune of £37 million, can he distinguish between the winners and losers or is there information in his Department which would enable him to do that?</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question on VAT.  I understand it was his intention on budget day to increase the VAT on services provided by hotels and restaurants, and particularly the provision of meals, from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  Since the announcement on increasing the lower rate of VAT to 12.5 per cent, I understand the Commissioner, Madame Schrivener who has responsibility for harmonisation, recommended that services in restaurants and hotels be in the lower VAT band, and we have been circulated to this effect by the lobby involved in forwarding the case of the restaurant and hotel business.  I would like clarification on this point because it is not my reading of what is <Col N="809" /> happening, yet we are getting submissions which need clarification.</P>

      <P>I will be commenting on the BES on Committee Stage.  Again, I thank the Minister, although I do not agree with his policy, for his speech which explains in very clear terms many of the more intricate sections of this Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The intervening period between the introduction of the Government's budget and the publication of this year's Finance Bill has, unfortunately, confirmed my own worst fears. Far from dealing with the major economic and social problem of unemployment, the budget which allocated just £500,000 to new measures to tackle unemployment is largely a non-event and a missed opportunity.  Since last December the number on the live register increased from just under 233,000 people to 246,500 people in March this year. With the data available to us, employment growth will be shown to have ceased so that realistically, and without any exaggeration, unemployment will top 300,000 by the end of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in 1993.  I am talking about unemployment as it is currently measured, not with the exemptions and the massaging to which Deputy Noonan referred.  If things fare worse than I fear, we could be hitting the guts of 300,000 by the end of this year. This is not a forecast which any Member can find easy to contemplate.  Already our rate of long term unemployment exceeds the Community average by a factor of 2.  Unemployment of 300,000 is we are facing on the basis of current cies, for which this Minister, and the <Col N="810" /> rest of the Government, are responsible. Let there be no misunderstanding, we are entering territory where the viability of Ireland as an economic and social entity is under severe threat.  The problems in some parts of our society are a manifestation of how serious that threat is.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to consider seriously the proposition we put to him in our pre-budget submission regarding a package of enhanced employment subsidies and job placement for the long term unemployed.  It is modest to suggest expenditure of £50 million this year and £120 million next year on a programme of this kind which ultimately is self-financing, as every person taken off the live register is a saving on Exchequer expenditure.  Recently the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Peter Cassells, appealed to the Government to establish a forum on unemployment so as to prevent the unemployed being treated as a political football.  In relation to the building of a social consensus, which I support, the Labour Party wish to see this process deepened and are willing to take a constructive approach.  At a minimum, the Government should establish a national forum on unemployment with the necessary resources and secretariat, so that all the political parties, interest groups, and particularly the organisations which directly represent the unemployed, can agree on a strategy for reducing unemployment over the next decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second major failure in this Bill is in the area of tax reform.  I heard the Minister say on radio that if anyone had better ideas than his own taxation proposals he would like to hear them.  He might consider the following.  Reducing the standard rate without maintaining the real value of personal allowances produces tax savings of only token value for those on low and middle incomes.  For example, somebody with a taxable income of £2,000 has his or her tax bill reduced by £120 per annum with the reduction of the standard rate from 35 per cent to 29 per cent.  Reducing the top rate without substantially increasing the standard tax band is also regressive.  This <Col N="811" /> represents a straight gain for just 20 per cent of all taxpayers.  Maintaining the system of allowances instead of tax credits means that the bulk of tax relief given in any budget favours those on top tax rates.  Before any further alteration in existing rates is contemplated, the Minister should consider converting all allowances to tax credits at the standard rate of 30 per cent or 29 per cent, using any savings to increase the value of the tax credit, increase the standard rate band to £3,500 for a single person and £7,000 for a married couple, and increase the 48 per cent band by £1,500 for a single person and £3,000 for a married couple. Based on the advice available to me, my estimate is that this would not cost any more than £450 million, the cost of this year's budget changes and those proposed in the PESP.  I would challenge the Minister to contrast what I am proposing &mdash; a 25 per cent standard rate and a 48 per cent top rate &mdash; with the existing bands and allowances indexed, which is what the Government are effectively proposing. The figures show that the majority of taxpayers would be better off under my proposals, particularly the bottom 50 per cent of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the changes introduced by the Government and those which they propose to implement is regressive in terms of income distribution. So much for tax reform by the Government.  I make these detailed points at the start of this debate because I understand that the tax reform drum is to be beaten loud and hard in the run up to the Progressive Democrats conference in Cork next weekend.  The tangible benefit to single workers in the paid employment sector, in many cases starting for the first time after a lengthy period in our education system, is of limited value because effectively they are taxed not at the standard rate but at the higher rates.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech on 30 January the Minister predicted a growth rate for the economy this year of 2¼ per cent of GNP. After a preliminary run over the various factors governing the perception of the <Col N="812" /> economy by the Government and the Department of Finance, the Minister concluded as follows:</P>
    <P>Taking all factors into account, I am projecting output growth this year of around 2¼ per cent, with real GNP up by around the same.  That kind of growth should stimulate more gains on the employment front.</P>
    <P>It is significant that in the Minister's introductory speech to the Finance Bill there is no longer any certainty.  There is no mention of 2¼ per cent, 2 per cent or 1.75 per cent; instead there is hedging and no definite assessment.  The opening remarks do not reveal a clear statement, based on the rigorous analysis available to the Minister from his many specialists within the Department of Finance and other agencies, of the estimated percentage growth in GNP this year.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder there is a public row between the Governor of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance? The Central Bank no longer trust the public utterances of the Department of Finance in this area and for that reason the bank are not prepared to reduce interest rates, as they are statutorily empowered to do.  They cannot reduce interest rates against a background of economic fudge.  What now is the Government's estimate of the percentage growth in GNP in 1991?  Upon that estimate the budgetary arithmetic must rest.  If there is no estimate or if the Government are not clear as to what it is, where do we stand?</P>
    <P>The Minister said today that he made it plain in presenting his budget that 1991 would undoubtedly be a difficult year.  Many students of English doing a précis of the budget speech would not be able to say the conclusion of the analysis was that 1991 would &ldquo;undoubtedly&rdquo; be a difficult year.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  The Minister said in the budget speech that growth would be halved as against last year but last year was a good year, relatively speaking. <Col N="813" /> There is now a shift.  The whole basis of confidence on which this fragile economy rests depends to a large extent on the institutions which make it work trusting the people in Government who have the responsibility for running the economy. In the first instance to trust them means sharing an agreed analysis of the situation. We are now drifting back to the glory days or nightmare days of a previous Administration led by Mr. Haughey of which Mr. O'Malley was also a willing participant when what was said was not what was meant and what was meant was not what was actually on the record.</P>

It was a temporary little arrangement in those days too, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because as you, Sir, may recall &mdash; indeed I am sure you have not forgotten &mdash; Deputy O'Malley ultimately resigned on the very point of lack of credibility of the figures that were produced by that Administration and because of the chaos and lack of trust that existed throughout the economic institutions and in the economy as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deliberately starting at the beginning &mdash; where the Minister for Finance started &mdash; in looking at the economic background against which the budget was framed and against which this Finance Bill has been introduced to give effect to that budget.  Nowhere in the introductory remarks of the Minister's speech today is there any clear indication that this economy is still on course for the set of macro-economic figures enunciated on 30 January. All of the provisions to give legal <Col N="814" /> effect to the expenditure and revenue accounts that make up the budget of 1991 and the legal underpinning which we are now being asked to provide are based on the premise that the arithmetic of the budget was correct and that the analysis of the performance of the economy in a deteriorating open world economy will be as predicted at that time.  Opposition Members from the three parties on this side of the House disputed the Minister's analysis of a 2.25 per cent growth in GNP at that time.  We were not alone.  Virtually every reputable independent economic analyst and forecaster, ranging from the Central Bank to various independent and reputable finance houses, disputed the optimism of that figure in and around the time of 30 January and certainly after the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not so rigid in his thinking that he is not capable of changing his mind.  He is flexible and has attracted the respect and admiration of a wide spectrum of Members in this House.  We are not dealing with a dogmatist.  Indeed, those people who put up a case in regard to the business expansion scheme were able to convince the Minister on the presentation of a certain analysis of the situation that there were grounds for a change.  They convinced him there were legitimate tangible grounds for a change in the position enunciated by him on 30 January and on 12 March he announced changes in the regime and we are being asked now on Second Stage to take note of those changes.  I want to underline this point because it is critical to a Second Stage debate.  Are the Government still of the view that while conditions in the business expansion scheme may change from 30 January to 12 March, the estimates of economic growth have not?  Are we still expecting a growth of 2.25 per cent in GNP or has that figure shifted?  If it has shifted, what is the estimate of economic growth now?  That is one of the triangular points of reference that underpin the arithmetic of this budget.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the second leg of the triangle, that is unemployment. Deputy Noonan has already made a substantial contribution on this area which <Col N="815" /> stands on the record of this House for anybody who is reading this debate <i>seriatim.</i> It is quite clear that the average number of 228,000 people on the live register throughout the 12 months of 1991 is an optimistic estimate relating in part to the estimated performance of the economy, to which I have already referred, but also discounting the fact or not taking fully into account that emigration would be reducing because of the dramatic drop in the labour market in the south-east of England where a large number of Irish people had moved over the past four to six years.  Since we have a common labour market between the two islands in more ways than one, the movement into their labour market was very high in the past two to three years. Because of the net migration from the Irish labour market in the first instance and now the inward migration of those who can no longer work in the UK because of a downturn in their economy, it appears to me that the basis which led the Department of Finance to calculate that an average of 228,000 people would be on the live register during 1991 is no longer valid.</P>
    <P>In trying to stake out the second leg of this triangle on which the foundations of this Finance Bill rest, will the Minister say what is the estimate of the Department of Finance in conjunction with the other bodies open to them, of the level of unemployment, taking account of the normal considerations; in other words, comparing like with like.  Is the figure now 248,000 or 260,000?  As a consequence of the increasing number on the live register, what knock-on effect will it have in terms of loss of the tax revenue on one side of the equation and the increase in tax expenditure in relation to social welfare and related payments?  There are a number of standard mechanisms of measurement that would very quickly enable people in the Department of Finance, who are available to the Minister, to feed the computer with a range of estimates which would then show us the figures.  I have not the resources the Minister has available to him but I suggest <Col N="816" /> that the number on the live register will not stand at 228,000 but that it will certainly be closer to 265,000 on average.  It could be as bad as that.  I am not trying to talk things down but I believe the number is of that order.  If that is the case, it would be very easy to do the calculations of the real deficit in the current account between now and the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say if this will be the only Finance Bill we will have in 1991? This is the third leg of the triangle.  Will this be the only response to the budget of 1991 or are we going to need another Bill?  If we are off-course, and some of the reasons are not necessarily the responsibility of this Government and certainly not of this Minister, the first thing any wise navigator or wise captain of a vessel will address and respond to is the realisation is that they are off-course and they will then take corrective action. I fear the refusal to recognise that we are off-course for a variety of reasons, over-optimism, miscalculation or the non-performance of the world economy over which we have little or no control, will prevent the Minister taking corrective action.  He may then succumb to the biggest temptation that is looming in front of him, that is, to use the proceeds of the flotation of the Irish Sugar Company to bridge the gap in current account spending towards the last few months of this year and, if short, to top that up with the proceeds from the flotation of Irish Life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about assets owned by all of us.  The Taoiseach in his Presidential address to the Fianna Fáil Ard Fhéis, made a number of references to such jewels and riches from our past. <Col N="817" /> I would regard the resources and wealth created by the efforts of taxpayers, the public in general, management, workers, farmers, all who have been traders and customers of State companies, such as the Irish Sugar Company and Irish Life as jewels of another value but no less important.  Are we now to contemplate the possibility that the cash realisation of those two companies will be put to temporary short term, ill-advised use to bridge the gap between what was thought to be the outturn in relation to the budgetary figures and what economic reality has dictated should be that outcome? The temptation to do precisely that becomes ever deeper and greater bearing in mind the fudge that emerged &mdash; and &ldquo;fudge&rdquo; is not the best description I could use to explain the response obtained &mdash; and Deputies Noonan and Rabbitte were present in the House when I attempted to question the Minister in relation to this.  On that occasion his assurance was that the proceeds would be used to reduce borrowing.  While I would have an argument to advance about that &mdash; to which I will revert later &mdash; the Minister for Finance gave a clear, categoric assurance that the proceeds would be used to reduce borrowing.  Since part of the overall budgetary arithmetic for this year includes an element of borrowing it would not be unreasonable to assume that capital receipts in 1991 could be offset against enunciated estimates of proposed capital borrowing, when one sets one group of figures against another.</P>
      <P>The budgetary figures set out on 30 January last indicated a borrowing requirement of £460 million.  If reduced revenue and increased expenditure, due to the factors to which I have referred result in a borrowing requirement of more than £460 million by the end of this year, can the Minister, assure us that the gap will not be bridged by the proceeds of the sale of State resources.  I am not sure whether I have posed that question as clearly as is required by the Minister and his advisers but I have stated fairly clearly on the record my concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me elaborate why I have done so. Earlier I said that the biggest problem <Col N="818" /> facing this economy, that which will haunt this economy according to senior economists in the ESRI and independent economists in a number of institutions here, is that, notwithstanding the substantial improvements in the fiscal aspects of our economic performance over the past three or four years <i>vis-á-vis</i> inflation, the need to have recourse to external borrowing and a number of other factors &mdash; things which have been achieved painfully by way of a growing consensus which must be welcomed by any sane, reasonable person and in some instances we have advanced further than many people thought we could within the appropriate timescale &mdash; unemployment, structural, heavy, deep, embedded, long term unemployment is now a major problem comfronting this economy on a scale that is perhaps greater than that prevailing in any other EC country.  In the past a comparison was drawn with Spain, a country with a comparable figure.  In fact the social and economic tradition of the Kingdom of Spain, in comparison with the Republic of Ireland in this area, is quite different.  One does not compare like with like if one takes simply the statistics, one set alongside the other.  I put it to the House and the Minister that, in absolute terms our long term unemployment rate &mdash; overall one of 18 per cent &mdash; imposes an enormous economic cost on our Exchequer and great physical damage on the immediate recipients of long term unemployment and their wider circle.  I contend that the scale of our unemployment is deeper, more damaging, and is potentially more disruptive to the social fabric of our society than in any other part of the European Community.  For that reason it should be as much a priority of any Government to deal with the problem of long term unemployment as that of getting on top of the national-debt, or balancing the books, so to speak, in the management of our economy.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this Government have a policy for money but none for people.  This Government and the Department of Finance appear to be obsessed with arithmetic rather than with <Col N="819" /> the reality of those figures and how they impact on the social stage.</P>
    <P>Let me return now to my concern about the proceeds of privatisation, or the selling off of the assets of either the Irish Sugar Company or Irish Life.  We have a national debt of the order of £25 billion.  The total proceeds of the two, if fully realised, would be between £300 million and £600 million.  I am deliberately employing a band so as not to fix a price on them which would give any indication to market forces outside.  Certainly they would be less than £1,000 million and, by way of reduction of our total national debt, will have little or no impact other than perhaps reduce the interest repayment bill of between £30 million to £60 million per annum in perpetuity. Surely the proceeds of the sale of Irish State companies can be used to create or strengthen employment, to reinforce existing State companies starved of capital but which have the potential for employment creation &mdash; companies such as Bord na Móna, which is profitable, now well managed and run efficiently by their workforce who have demonstrated enormous flexibility, but nonetheless a company that is ludicrously structured in terms of its capital base?  The Irish Sugar Company &mdash; received something like £39 million of State capital equity over the past five or six years, according to some of the stories reported in the <i>Business Post</i> at its launch over the weekend.  Surely Bord na Móna, who have shown similar ability to turn round in terms of their operations, profit and loss account, productivity, are entitled to some capital injection from the proceeds of the sale of that company to enable them achieve a balanced balance sheet, to expand and create real jobs, based in Ireland, founded on Irish resources and dependent on Irish expertise?</P>
    <P>I raise that point because in his substantial contribution to the debate the Minister referred to the economic climate within which the Bill is being introduced. It is clear in a separate but related context that the Government are expecting substantial proceeds from the sale of two <Col N="820" /> State companies this year.  From what the Minister said on radio over the weekend there was no set programme of proposed sales of further State companies but nothing was ruled out in relation to the sale of any one of them should that prove to be a desirable objective and should the price, so to speak, prove to be attractive. The Minister for Finance will have overall responsibility for the disposal of those capital receipts.  Against the background it is appropriate for us to ask the Minister on Second Stage, against the set of budgetary arithmetic upon which this Bill rests &mdash; what his intentions are and why? If the proceeds are to be used as he indicated in response to a parliamentary question, exclusively to reduce the national debt, why are they not used to deal with the question of unemployment? This brings me back to the first point I made, that in relation to unemployment, particularly long term unemloyment, the Government have no economic policy whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Modest growth of the order of 1.5 per cent, or even if we achieve in 1991 &mdash; it is sad to relate I do not believe we will &mdash; growth of 2.25 per cent it will be achieved by internal productivity measures which will not substantially increase the real workforce by any significant amount. There may be some gains &mdash; all gains are welcome &mdash; but on the scale of need we have, the type of gain which will come from an economic GNP growth rate of the order of 1.5 per cent or 1.75 per cent will not make any impact whatsoever. Therefore, there must be an additional impetus from the Government.</P>
    <P>We are not the only people who dispute these figures.  It is not only the Opposition parties who are challenging the Minister for Finance or, indeed, the Government on their overall economic analysis, whether it is economic growth, their estimate of unemployment or other factors. Economic commentators, investors and institutions who operate our market economic system are also distrustful of the public pronouncements and statements of the Government.  It would appear that the Central Bank are equally distrustful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> The relationship between the Central Bank and the Government is a very delicate and intimate one and yet by definition and by law it must and should be a very separate one.  I would not like to see the UK system operating in Ireland. Under that system the Chancellor of the Exchequer can intervene with the Bank of England.  Certainly, the philosophical thinking within the 12 member states of the Community is for an independent Central Bank type of institution as distinct from the Bank of France or the Bank of England who it is argued &mdash; an argument with which I would agree &mdash; are open to too much political interference. There is a very intimate and delicate political relationship between the Governor of the Central Bank in any economy and the Minister for Finance and the Government on the other hand.  Part of that relationship depends for its effective operation on real trust, real sensitivity and a high level of discretion because markets in the nature of things are very nervous beasts.  If that relationship begins to appear to outside observers as it currently does then the Minister for Finance, and the Government, are doing no service to the country at large and, in particular, to the economy.</P>
    <P>In asking the Minister to clarify the statistical questions I posed at the outset of my contribution not only would he be responding to this debate but he would be availing of an opportunity to re-introduce into the economic analysis of our economy at this difficult time, a degree of certainty and a degree of analysis which, hopefully, we could all share and with which we could all agree.  We could then get on to the business of deciding, against an agreed set of figures, the options open to us, how to proceed and what we should do next.  Until such time as the Minister avails of the opportunity and the argument I put forward &mdash; this is my considered view and if I am wrong I would like to be refuted &mdash; Irish interest rates will remain at their present level.</P>
    <P>On top of the international macro-economic factors which are depressing the potential for growth in Ireland, we have the real internal domestic situation <Col N="822" /> of effectively very high interest rates.  A person has the option of putting money into a fairly secure financial institution on reasonable terms of withdrawal &mdash; six months or a year &mdash; and receiving a gross rate of 10 per cent which is a 7 per cent return allowing for inflation.  A borrower has to borrow money at overdraft rates. If they are risk-takers they are coming in at the edge of the economic system.  The banks, who are not risk-takers, are perhaps the one financial institution here who are asset obsessed in terms of the basis on which they give money.  For an investor, be it the general manager of Bord na Móna or a private individual taking a possible plunge in one of the designated areas which Deputy Noonan discussed earlier, the return he or she has to earn for the banks before they start to see any return for themselves is enormous. That high rate of domestic interest which is in part a product of the lack of trust that exists between the financial institutions, including the Central Bank, on the one hand and the Department of Finance and the Government on the other, is an imposed economic impediment which is preventing us from realising the potential for domestic-led and generated economic growth upon which we so desperately depend.</P>
    <P>I will add an additional dimension to that scenario to which the Minister or his advisers might respond.  It is my understanding that because the investment climate it so marginal due to the cost of borrowing money it is making the equation of viability for some projects so problematic that those which had intended availing of EC Structural Funds are not going ahead.  Consequently, the Government's estimate of the drawdown into the Irish economy of EC Structural Funds for tourism related products and projects that have a private sector involvement, will not occur at the rate anticipated because of the interest rate penalty to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>The first manifesto of the Irish Women's Movement &ldquo;Irish Women &mdash; Chains or Change&rdquo;, published in 1971, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law&rdquo; [Article 40, Constitution of Ireland]. One million four hundred and thirty four thousand, nine hundred and seventy Irish citizens are not accorded equal rights.  These are the women of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The census of 1986 shows that of a total population of 3.54 million, women then represented 1.771 million or 50.02 per cent.  Dr. Ailbhe Smyth in her article &mdash; Women and Power in Ireland: Problems, Progress, Practice &mdash; said, &ldquo;Despite very real progress since the heady euphoria of the early days of the Women's Movement, far from being a reality, equality is still an aspiration for women in Ireland&rdquo;. It is a fact that there has been a series of significant legislative reforms in the areas of employment equality, violence towards women and, to some extent, family law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The source of women's rights in Ireland is the Constitution.  The Constitution <Col N="824" /> should make it very clear that women and men have equal rights, and by this we mean equal political, social and economic rights.  The Oireachtas is the main instrument for establishing new and equal rights.  The Oireachtas and successive Governments record in this sphere is abysmal.  Most rights won by women in the last 30 years have resulted from expensive court cases and the EC, not from the Oireachtas or the Government of the day.  Attempts to bring about equality have been resisted &mdash; for example, the Government sought a derogation from the equal pay directives, the State had to be brought to the European Court to grant women equal social welfare benefits, and women had to bring constitutional cases for equal taxation, legal aid, contraception and the right to sit on juries.</P>
    <P>The United Nations report of the Committee to Eliminate Discrimination against Women, Article 2(a), requires states to condemn discrimination against women in all its forms and to undertake to embody the principle of equality for men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure through law and other appropriate means the practical realisation of this principle.  That, in its own right, is a reason we should incorporate such an amendment in the Constitution, but there are others also.</P>
    <P>I am proposing to insert the following words in Article 40.1 of the Constitution: &ldquo;Rights under the law shall not be limited or denied by the State by virtue of distinction of sex&rdquo;.  The 1922 Constitution used the words &ldquo;without distinction of sex&rdquo; in two Articles and, in particular, assisted in directing equality towards men and women.  Mr. de Valera made it clear that political rights was what was intended by his Constitution.  I want to make it very clear at this stage that I do not intend to make a party political issue of this.  The Constitution as a political and legal document has many fine contents, but after 54 years, the Constitution is in need of amendment, and Mr. de Valera recognised this.  He amended the Constitution <Col N="825" /> before the time which allowed the Oireachtas to do that expired, and tried to amend it in 1959.</P>
    <P>I am further asking this House to adopt this constitutional amendment at this time so that the amendment can be put by way of referendum on the same day as the local elections on 27 June next. It is very clear from a major article in yesterday's <i>The Irish Times</i> that, as Yvonne Scannell notes: &ldquo;until the `70s, de Valera's Constitution, in particular, Article 40.1, allowed the passage of legislation which was restrictive to women, just as the joint committee had feared&rdquo;. She was referring to a joint committee of women's societies and social workers of 1937 who had argued strongly that that would be the result.  Ms Scannell pointed out that up until the seventies that was the case.</P>
    <P>The women's group of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, in seeking to redress the extent to which socio-economic and legal systems continued to discriminate against women explicitly or implicitly, recommends the insertion of an equal rights clause in Article 40 of the Constitution because, as they put it:</P>
    <P>(a)  Such a Clause would provide a legal definition of equality;</P>
    <P>(b)  Article 40 does not clearly and unambiguously state that discrimination on the basis of sex is prohibited;</P>
    <P>(c)  Such a Clause would be a catalyst for necessary reform in both the public and the private spheres;</P>
    <P>(d)  It would give women the right to challenge what they perceive to be discriminatory laws and practice;</P>
    <P>(e)  It would, ultimately, affect attitudes over a period of time.</P>
    <P>I fully accept these points and the argument that an equal rights clause would have significant symbolic and ideological value in that it would accentuate the need for a real commitment to equality within the State.</P>
    <P>Article 41.2 of the Constitution is patronising.  It states: &ldquo;by her life within the home, woman&rdquo;, it gives the generic <Col N="826" /> term woman, &ldquo;gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved&rdquo;.  To quote Dr. Smyth:</P>
    <P>In Ireland, the confinement of women to the private, domestic sphere is especially marked.  The Constitution, legislation, social welfare provisions, services and facilities (or the lack of these) reinforce this confinement, and seriously limit the extent to which we (that is, women) can enjoy economic independence and personal autonomy.</P>
    <P>A woman's place is a woman's choice. The Constitution says nothing about a man's place.  It speaks of mothers' duties in the home, not parents' duties.  It reinforces the inequitable division of labour and responsibility in the home.  Although in theory it could be used to improve the rights of women in the home, in practice it was relied upon by the State in the Murphy tax case, the Hyland case &mdash; a claim for equal social welfare benefits &mdash; and the Dennehy case &mdash; a claim by a man for deserted husband's benefit &mdash; to justify sex discriminations.  These are the very sections of the Constitution which one would presume guarantee equality. The State should undertake never to use such a defence again.  Research shows that Article 40.1 has been relied upon only twice to outlaw sex discriminations &mdash; in the adoption case and in the domicile of married women case.</P>
    <P>Many of the patent discriminations are now illegal but there are many latent discriminations which cannot be attacked on constitutional grounds or which would be very difficult to attack.  The disbursement of public moneys and the provision of publicly funded or endowed programmes and facilities which confer a disproportionate benefit on men at the expense of women should be unconstitutional. For example, it would be interesting to examine what proportion of the national lottery funds given for community facilities is made available for facilities which women can use.  If there was an explicit prohibition against sex discrimination in the Constitution this might be outlawed. <Col N="827" /> Public money should not be given for services or facilities which discriminate against women &mdash; such as in golf clubs. Public programmes, for example, educational policies and training schemes should be framed to respect the equal rights of the sexes.  If they do not it should be possible to challenge them and examples of this are the FAS schemes, which disproportionately favour men, and the syllabi for our schools.  If over 50 per cent of the population were black or Muslim and held a tiny percentage of State offices, we would condemn it out of hand as apartheid-based discrimination.</P>
    <P>Ponder, then, the following statistics: of the total number of judges &mdash; 94 &mdash; only six are women; until recently only five were women; of the 16 secretaries of Government Departments only one is a woman and research shows that only one woman ever held the position of secretary of a Government Department.  Of the 99 assistant secretaries of Government Departments only one is a woman; out of 15 Cabinet Ministers only one is a woman; out of 15 Ministers of State there are two women; of the 166 Members of this House only 13 are women and of the 66 Senators only six are women.  Of the people covered by the Top Level Appointments Commission in the Department of the Public Service, of the 465 people I just mentioned, 29 are women.  Six per cent of the top jobs in the public sector go to women.  The remaining 94 per cent go to men, yet women make up in excess of 50 per cent of the population.  Far from being a main protagonist for equality, it is clear that the State is among the leaders in discriminating against women.  Out of a Garda force of 10,500 people, 400 are women; only 14 of that 400 have ever been promoted. Women gardaí comprise less than 4 per cent of the force.  Ireland has fewer women police officers than any European police force except Iceland.  All the political parties share responsibility for this</P>
    <P>A related factor, of course, is that at precisely the time when men are building up their career prospects the Constitution expects a woman to spend her life in the <Col N="828" /> home childbearing and mothering.  There is probably no higher vocation than childbearing and mothering.  The point is that women should not be compelled to eternally follow this route and in our attitude, our thinking, our laws and primarily in our Constitution, equality of opportunity without distinction of sex should be available.</P>
    <P>The Constitution contains about eight Articles which, &ldquo;if boldly and imaginatively interpreted&rdquo;, to quote an eminent lawyer, &ldquo;could be read as vindicating the principle that women and men have equal rights&rdquo;.  However, bold imagination may reign in one Supreme Court, only to be overturned by a future court.  The Articles concerned are: 9.1.3º, which deals with citizenship, 16.1.2º, which deals with the right to vote, 40.1, which refers to equality &ldquo;as human persons&rdquo;&mdash; the Article most readers of the Constitution would presume to confer equality but which has not been relied on in most cases by the court and which has been used by the State to defend discrimination; 40.2.3º, the State guarantees &ldquo;to respect and, so far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of citizens&rdquo;, 41.2, which recognises that &ldquo;by her life within the home, woman gives the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved&rdquo; and further provides that &ldquo;the State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home&rdquo;, 41.3, which provides a State pledge to &ldquo;guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack&rdquo;, 42, which vests the primary right to educate children in the parents, and 45 &mdash; though directive principles for guidance of the Oireachtas only and not cognisable by any court &mdash; which states &ldquo;men and women equally have a right to an adequate means of livelihood&rdquo;.  Everything depends on the interpretation of these Articles by the courts and these Articles taken together.</P>
    <P>The failure of the courts to apply Article 40.1 or Article 40.3 to all sex discrimination cases, together with the <Col N="829" /> deterrent of enormously expensive legal costs and the strict requirement on <i>locus standi</i> has meant that constitutional vindication of women's rights has been piecemeal and excessively dependent on the accidents of litigation.</P>
    <P>In Murtagh Properties <i>v.</i> Cleary, where the barman's union sought to prevent the employment of a barwoman, the case failed when the High Court held that Article 40.3 &mdash; although not stated in the Article &mdash; included the right of women to an adequate means of livelihood and that &ldquo;a policy or general rule under which anyone seeks to prevent an employer from employing men or women on the grounds of sex only is prohibited by the Constitution&rdquo;.  In McGee <i>v.</i> the Attorney General the Supreme Court again relied on Article 40.3 &mdash; for married persons. The Juries Act, 1927, which exempted women from service unless they applied was held to be unconstitutional &mdash; DeBurca and Anderson <i>v.</i> the Attorney General 1976 &mdash; under Article 38.5 on the definition of a jury.</P>
    <P>In Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General certain sections of the Income Tax Act, 1967, were held to be unconstitutional as penal rates of income tax were levied on married women.  Article 41 deals with the family as a primary unit and the protection of the family.</P>
    <P>In 1978 in Sonjee <i>v.</i> the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General the constitutionality of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, was upheld. The court found that the provision that an alien woman marrying an Irish man is automatically entitled, at her option, to Irish citizenship, whereas an alien man marrying an Irish woman is not, is an acceptable discrimination.  The court found that this is not prohibited by Article 40.1 as the Act was no more than a diversity of arrangements.</P>
    <P>The courts, with perhaps three exceptions, despite several invitations consistently refused to outlaw sex discrimination <i>per se</i> under Article 40.1. Instead, they have limited Article 40.1 to a mere &ldquo;acknowledgment of the human equality of all citizens&rdquo; a phrase which, although it does relate to the &ldquo;human <Col N="830" /> attributes, or the ethnic, racial, social or religious background&rdquo; of citizens, and even their &ldquo;dignity as human beings&rdquo; does not include within those human attributes the gender of the citizen.</P>
    <P>In De Burca and Anderson <i>v.</i> the Attorney General; Sonjee <i>v.</i> the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General and Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, one judge in each case held that Article 40.1 prohibited sex discrimination in these cases but these were in a minority and are the only three such judicial views as far as can be ascertained, except O'G <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, which I will refer to later, and the domicile of married women case.  None of these statements formed the basis for the decision in which they appear.</P>
    <P>In many cases the court has limited the application of rights under Article 40.1. Mr. Justice Kenny in Murtagh Properties <i>v.</i> Cleary said that the guarantee in Article 40.1 had &ldquo;nothing to do with the trading activities of citizens or the conditions under which they are employed&rdquo;.  He further opined that differences in salary on the grounds of sex would not be unconstitutional; the 1974 Anti-Discrimination Pay Act did establish the right to equal pay for equal work.  It is clear that the Constitution did not prevent inequalities.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the courts should be able to rely on the Constitution and the law.  The Employment Equality Act, 1977 seeks to eliminate discrimination. Yet, such discrimination continues even in the upper echelons of the State apparatus.</P>
    <P>Statutory right to maternity leave was established by the Maternity Protection for Employees Act, 1981, which provides that female employees are entitled to maternity leave for 14 weeks minimum.</P>
    <P>The Family Home Protection Act, 1976, prohibits the legal owner of a family home from selling it without the knowledge and consent of the spouse &mdash; this falls short of establishing a joint legal right to ownership of the family home.</P>
    <P>A woman's contribution to the family by her work at home, should she choose to work at home, and the rearing of children does not entitle her to a share in her <Col N="831" /> husband's wealth, even when this is partly generated by State support like tax reliefs and grants obtained by virtue of marriage.</P>
    <P>The remarriage prospects of a widow claiming damages for the death of her husband are considered relevant when assessing the amount of damages awardable. The social welfare system is founded on the philosophy that women are dependent on men and that the State must only support them when this dependence ceases.</P>
    <P>In O'G <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, High Court, March 1984, there was a declaration that sex discrimination &ldquo;may&rdquo; be unconstitutional under Article 40.1 &mdash; an adoption case where the High Court found that a man could continue with the adoption of a child after the sudden death of his wife even though the final adoption order had not been made.  Until this time, only a woman could so do.  Ironically, it was a case involving a man which brought this point out.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that the Constitution as a political and legal document falls very short of providing for sex equality and against sex discrimination.</P>
    <P>Eavan Boland wrote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It's a woman's world&rdquo; Our way of life has hardly changed since a wheel first whetted a knife...</P>
    <P>And it's still the same: By night our windows moth our children to the flame</P>
    <P>of hearth not history. And still no page scores the low music of our outrage.</P>
    <P>I am the father of four children, three of whom are female.  As a parent I am entitled to expect that, nine years from the turn of the century, my children will grow up with the same opportunities whether they are male or female.  Up to now that has not been the case.  This House has an opportunity to give the <Col N="832" /> lead.  We have the opportunity on 27 June to propose a simple, non-controversial, all-party agreed amendment to the Constitution at virtually no expense.</P>
    <P>After 64 years the Constitution, like all law, needs amending.  It probably needs a major overhaul and review.  Mr. Lemass said in 1966, when he appointed a Constitutional Review Committee, that a review should take place about every 25 years.  Ironically, it is exactly 25 years since the last review.  De Valera himself amended the Constitution and sought to amend it yet again in 1959.  There is nothing sacrosanct about the Constitution. Like all law it must serve the people, not the other way around.  This amendment need not await a major overhaul.  The people of Ireland are already ahead of us, having elected the first woman Head of State, one of the few such elected Heads of State in Europe.</P>
    <P>In eight years time we will be approaching the 21st Century.  This is a golden opportunity.  Let us not take defensive positions.  We are all culpable in this House.  Amending the Constitution on its own will not make women equal overnight but it will set a headline and will remove any doubt from the Constitution. This is an opportunity for us to purge our guilt and to take a signal step towards bringing women into the equal partnership they so richly deserve.  It gives me pleasure, Sir, to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Barnes, and to move the Second Stage of this important Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, for sharing his time with me on such an important Bill and to commend him on introducing what I consider to be one of the most positive and affirmative acts in regard to equality to be introduced in this legislature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the 1937 Constitution, and a timely article appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday with regard to the lobbying by women against certain sections of the Constitution which was not heard.  I agree with him that there is no more appropriate <Col N="833" /> time than now to reverse what may now be interpreted as a reflection of the time. The 1937 Constitution's treatment of women may be excused but it will not be forgiven if we do not take this opportunity to amend it now in the light of changing circumstances.  We will have an appropriate opportunity on 27 June to do this.  Doing this now will not be costly to the State but may in the future mean considerable savings when one considers the cost in the past 20 years of court case after court case, of campaign after campaign, of European case after European case as we were dragged slowly and almost screaming to an acceptable position within the European forum.</P>
    <P>One of the first tenets of the Treaty of Rome was that equal rights would be extended to women and the necessary legislation would have to be introduced not just at European level but at national level.  Our history in that area has been lamentable and I would like to think we could draw a veil over it.  There was derogation after derogation.  The necessary legislation was brought in in a miserly way, left until the last moment, and, unfortunately, it very often backlashed on the very women to whom it was supposed to grant equality because successive Administrations did not plan for it and did not take it seriously.  The legislation that was introduced was too little too late.</P>
    <P>Up to now we have not shown any political will to observe the spirit of the law because even when we have introduced legislation to grant equal rights to women the legislation was so contorted that the very law providing for equality has been used against women.  I will give one instance because it is important. There was a huge difference between the income of waiters and waitresses in a certain industry, the men earning much more than the women.  There was also an unequal division of work in so far as the women had the greatest burden and responsibility.  This was deemed to be a case of inequality.  It had to go through the slow and tortuous channels such cases have to go through &mdash; nobody concedes that there is inequality until the very last <Col N="834" /> minute.  The Labour Court came to the extraordinary conclusion that while there was inequality both in terms of income and division of work in this case it could not be decided as it was not an equal case any longer &mdash; the women did much more work than the men.  Equal was not equated with equal in this case.  These women were denied equal pay on the basis of that contorted and totally negative attitude to equality law.</P>
    <P>This Bill would cut across much of the legislation which would have to be brought into this House piece by piece, which, as we all know, can be a long and laborious task.  The inclusion of an equality clause in the Constitution would cut across the need for much of this legislation and do away with the necessity of having to bring each case before the Labour Court.  It would also indicate the importance we as politicians and legislators attach to equal rights for women.  It would show our acceptance of the equality of women not just in the spirit of the law but also in the written law.  It is important that such a clause is integrated into the Constitution as it would reverse what the Constitution has done to women down through the decades.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 22 April 1991 entitled, &ldquo;When Eamon de Valera tried to ignore the women of Ireland&rdquo;.  It is heart warming to note that at that time 16 women's societies, as they were nicely called then, were lobbying on behalf of women's rights in a democratic way.  Those societies were not given time by the President to make their case about their worries in regard to certain sections of the Constitution. They stated, and I quote from the article:</P>
    <P>The Constitution is being changed, and amendments may be inserted which might vitally affect the interests of women.  It seems to us to be grossly unjust that a committee representing 16 women's societies will not be accorded an hour of the President's time.</P>
    <P>The article continues:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> Throughout the 1920s and 30s the equality enjoyed by Irish women in 1922, as guaranteed in Article 3 of the Free State Constitution, was steadily eroded under the impact and consolidation of the patriarchal viewpoint.</P>
    <P>They were right as that is exactly what happened.  I want to refer further to what I consider to have been a very sad and painful time.  The article states:</P>
    <P>Senator Jenny Wyse-Power spoke at length of the bitterness felt by Irish women who had worked alongside their men to establish a new nation, many of whom now found themselves excluded from the basic right of earning a proper living.  She remembered how, during the War of Independence, women had successfully worked as messengers and inspectors around the country, positions for which they were now suddenly deemed physically unfit.</P>
    <P>As we know, these women worked solidly and courageously beside the men in the GPO and in other danger spots.  When they marched out of their factories in support of the strikes and lock-outs of 1913 they were either demoted or sacked. Those women were not afraid to take their place beside men.  However, to our eternal sadness and shame the 1937 Constitution not only did not honour the contribution those women had made but it eroded the rights they had enjoyed for a decade and a half previously.</P>
    <P>If this House does not accept the clause which Deputy Mitchell has put forward or, if there are any legal difficulties with it, a comparable one, we will be marginalising, ignoring, undervaluing and undermining women all over again.  However, the difference this time is that we will be doing this with 54 years of experience and wisdom behind us.  We will be flying in the face of Europen Community ideals and directives which have ensured the introduction of most of our equality legislation. We will be ignoring the covenants and conventions of the United Nations who promoted a women's decade, from 1975-86, to ensure that all nations <Col N="836" /> acknowledged in spirit as well as in word what has been denied to women for so long.  The inclusion of this clause in the Constitution would remove the embarrassment and shame Irish women experience &mdash; I should like to think Irish men feel the same &mdash; at international fora when we are held up as a model where much still needs to be done in this area and where votes of sympathy are passed to the women of Ireland.  We should remember that this is happening in the nineties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the lack of protection for women.  One of the reasons I expect all sides of the House to support this Bill is that for many decades women have been under the illusion that the Constitution protected them in some way.</P>

      <P>Women still believe that the Constitution protects them.  I put it to the House that it has not protected them and that it must now protect them. It took the Succession Act of the sixties to ensure that women would not be disinherited after 50 or 60 years of marriage. I want to pay tribute to the Taoiseach for introducing that Act.  It is appalling to think that women who had been married for so long could have been disinherited.  It took until 1976 before women got a guarantee that their houses would not be sold over their heads, without their knowledge.  We have yet to bring in a Bill which will give women joint ownership not just of the family home but of the entire property.  Even though the Constitution pays some lip service to the work they do in the home women have still not got that protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the level of domestic violence against women.  This ranges from rape and wife battering to pornography. These issues have to be addressed <Col N="837" /> seriously.  The acceptance of the clause proposed by Deputy Mitchell would be one way of dealing with such problems.</P>
    <P>In relation to women at work, we have an equal pay Act, an employment equality Act and an Act dealing with maternity leave yet the majority of women are still in part-time, contract and under-paid work.  Their income is not on the level of men's income.  Opportunity for women, even in the public service, is lamentable. If we are serious about removing inequalities for women we must ensure that this clause is included in the Constitution.  We must ensure that all legislation is screened so that not alone does it not contain inequalities but that it positively supports the removal of them.</P>

      <P>I preface my remarks by saying that the Minister of State at the Taoiseach's Department, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, who has been assigned a co-ordinating and monitoring role on all aspects of Government policy as they affect women, would, in the normal course, be the principal Government spokesperson for this debate, but she is abroad on official business. I therefore have the honour to speak on behalf of the Government in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are totally committed to establishing the equality of women in every area of national life.  Very substantial progress has been made and is being made.  The social reforms of the last 25 years, beginning with the Succession Act, establishing equality in the workplace, in the tax code, and for the protection and enhancement of the status of women rearing children and working full time in the home have brought about tremendous advances.  The first Commission on the Status of Women in the seventies set the agenda for reform in the seventies.  The ending of the ban on married women in the Civil Service in 1973, the introduction of free legal aid in 1979, and of paid maternity leave in 1980 as a result of the second national understanding were milestones.  In 1983, an <Col N="838" /> Oireachtas Joint Committee was established on women's rights, which has been re-established in the present Dáil, and which is unique in Europe.</P>
    <P>The programme of law reform carried out by the Government since 1987 has been far-reaching, including the abolition of illegitimacy, the reform of the adoption law, the judicial separation Act, the reform of the rape law, and child abduction legislation.  The protection of part-time workers, the extension of PRSI to the self-employed, the extension of treatment benefits to the dependent spouses, the introduction of a carer's allowance are some of the advances that have been made in the social area.  Many more women have been appointed to State boards and head Government commissions and task forces, and a second woman has recently been appointed to the High Court.  A substantial section is devoted to equality in the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>In 1989 the UN committee to eliminate discrimination against women considered Ireland's detailed report on our implementation of the UN convention on the same subject.  The committee, according to a UN press release praised Ireland for its efforts to promote women. Most experts commended the report, saying it was one of the best the committee had ever received.</P>
    <P>More recently, the Government have established the Second Commission on the Status of Women, which will seek to identify remaining impediments to equality, that need to be removed, and some of their interim recommendations will be announced at the end of this week.</P>
    <P>No one has seriously suggested to date, or has been able to demonstrate that any of the reforms so far undertaken or indeed any of the reforms that might be contemplated or advocated have been inhibited or prevented as a result of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The Constitution, as presently worded, assumes the equality <Col N="839" /> of the sexes throughout, as the words citizens or persons are the words used in connection with rights.  Introducing the phrase, &ldquo;rights under the law shall not be limited or denied by the State by virtue of distinction of sex&rdquo; would add absolutely nothing to the Constitution.  It is merely another way of putting what is already in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment is unnecessary because laws which discriminate solely on the grounds of sex are not permissible under the existing terms of the Constitution.  For example, the High Court has declared unconstitutional a provision of the Adoption Act, 1974, which made a distinction between the respective rights of men and women to adopt because, the court said, the provision was</P>
      <P>founded on an idea of difference in capacity between men and women which had no foundation in fact and it was, therefore, an unwarranted denial of human equality and was repugnant to Article 40.1 of the Constitution.  (T. O'G <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, 1985).</P>
      <P>Again, it was stated in the Supreme Court in De Búrca's case that</P>
      <P>it is not open to the State to discriminate in its enactments between the persons who are subject to its laws solely upon the ground of the sex of those persons.  (1976).</P>
      <P>Dr. Yvonne Scannell, quoted in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, has made the point that many of the Articles of the Constitution can and have been used to vindicate women's rights and to challenge laws that discriminated against women.  She states:</P>
      <P>Our legislators must know that, should they fail in their duty to vindicate women's rights, the Constitution will be involved even more frequently to compel them.</P>
      <P>She remarks on the irony that the Constitution, despite the prevailing ethos of the time, may yet justify the claim that it truly belongs to the women to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events the introduction of the phrase ending `by virtue of distinction of sex' will not add one iota to the effectiveness of the Constitution with regard to the principle of equality.</P>
      <P>An American constitutional historian, Professor Arthur Schlesinger, has aptly made the point:</P>
      <P>Constitution-tinkering is a flight from the hard question, which is the search for a remedy.  Structure is an alibi for policy failure.  Let us not be beguiled by constitutional reform from the real tasks of State craft.  In the end, politics is the high and serious art of solving substantive problems.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party, in particular, are continually seeking amendments to the Constitution, as a substitute for solving real problems.  Constitutional referenda are expensive and cumbersome procedures, and should only be employed sparingly, when important consequences will flow from the proposed amendment, or when necessary legislation is blocked in the absence of the amendment.  It cannot be demonstrated that any consequences will flow from this amendment, which simply restates in a slightly different way what is in the Constitution already.  Nor is any legislative reform blocked in the absence of such an amendment.</P>
      <P>I regret that there has been an increasing resort by Fine Gael to making proposals for constitutional change, as nothing more than a publicity tactic, as a way of striking attitudes, without having to address issues of substance.</P>
      <P>I can count nine proposals for constitutional referenda since Fine Gael went into Opposition, three of them in the last six months.  There is the proposal we are now discussing, the same week that Fine Gael suggested a referendum to do with bail.  Then there was the gimmick of a peace referendum during the Presidential Election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Constitutional amendments have also been proposed to amend the rights of <Col N="841" /> property, the powers of the President, the right of the Government to conclude international agreements, the rights of children, the single transferable vote and divorce.  Referenda may indeed be required from time to time, but not every few months, and many of the proposals mentioned do not have any very pressing merit in terms of the criteria I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>This proposal has clearly been put together in some haste.  The Irish language version of those parts of the amendment already in the Constitution does not exactly correspond with the wording now in the Constitution, whereas the English language version is the same.  It is not to be excluded that some issue might be made of the divergence in the texts, especially as the Irish language version has primacy.  What is the significance or purpose of the changes?  Secondly, any proposal for a constitutional referendum would need to be accompanied by special legislation to make arrangements for the holding of a ballot.</P>
    <P>When Fine Gael propose constitutional change, they do it with a bewildering light-heartedness.  We have this instant approach adopted more with an eye to publicity than with any serious intent to change anything.</P>
    <P>The real challenge before us as legislators at this stage in the vast majority of instances is not equality of rights, which is already in the Constitution, but equality of opportunity, and this can almost certainly be better effected by legislative change, and by promoting better employment and administrative practices than by any change in the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be appropriate at times for a Minister or Minister of State <Col N="842" /> to chide the Opposition for initiating a Bill in Private Members' time but I would like to take this opportunity to defend the Opposition's right to do so, in particular Bills to amend the Constitution.  Many Members of this House realise that, although it has served us well, many changes need to be made to it.  I want to make it clear at the outset that the Labour Party will support the Bill but it should not be taken that we accept that the method suggested, to achieve what Deputy Mitchell and his colleagues wish to achieve, is the proper one.  We will support the Bill on Second Stage for the obvious reason that we have always been committed to the achievement of equality and the elimination of inequality and injustice wherever it occurs.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is a history of discrimination against women in Ireland. Even though they are in the majority, as Deputy Mitchell said, they are treated as if they were members of a minority group and exploited.  Any legislation which seeks to address and rectify that situation is to be welcomed.  The Labour Party welcome the opportunity to address this proposed amendment to the Constitution in a constructive way, but our decision to support the Bill on Second Stage should not be construed as total support.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as it stands, is almost irrelevant to the task in hand.  Worse still, in our opinion, having researched the subject, it is badly prepared and ill-thought out and its consequences have not been considered.  As a result, in all probability, this Bill could do some damage to the cause of equality if passed in its present form.  In short, although we support its principle, we will not support the proposal that it be passed into law unless and until a number of crucial changes are made.</P>
      <P>Our objections and reservations will become clear, which I hope will be acknowledged by Fine Gael, when we come to consider the purpose of the Bill. It has been proposed that we insert the following three sentences in the Constitution:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
    <P>Rights under the law shall not be limited or denied by the State by virtue of distinction of sex.  This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
    <P>Given that this amendment if accepted by the people in a referendum, would impose an obligation on the State but not on anybody else one would have to question what the Bill would achieve or the rights it would confer on any section of our community.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment would prevent the State from passing any discriminatory legislation and I presume would allow existing discriminatory legislation to be struck out but even that could not be guaranteed for reasons I will give in a few moments.  If it could be presumed that the proposed amendment would prevent the State from passing discriminatory legislation, the question I would have to ask is: so what?  The State has never knowingly proposed discriminatory legislation, on the grounds of sex, and, as far as I am aware, it has no plans in the future to introduce such legislation. If it were to do so &mdash; I sincerely hope it will not &mdash; it would find itself in extreme difficulty with the European Commission, apart altogether from any other considerations.</P>
    <P>Do the movers of the Bill realise that the only effect the Bill would have is to prevent the State from drafting and enacting discriminatory legislation?  It would have no other effect.  Furthermore, I cannot think of any legislation which would be struck out by the courts if this proposed amendment was incorporated in the Constitution.  Neither could I see the State being compelled to draft legislation in a different way in the future. One would have to ask therefore &mdash; I think this is what the Minister of State was getting at &mdash; what is the point.  It is clear that one would be wasting time in proposing a Bill the purpose of which is to <Col N="844" /> prevent the State from doing something which it does not do anyway and cannot do as long as we are members of the European Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I can tell you, Sir, and Deputy Mitchell that the difference between social functions is not easy to define, especially if one is relying on the Constitution for the answer.  Nowhere in the Constitution, for example, can one find a definition of the social function of a man, but that of women is more clearly defined in the Constitution and one does not have to look much further than Article 41.  Article 41 says clearly &mdash; I hope I will be excused for paraphrasing it &mdash; that a woman's place is in the home.  The Article provides that: &ldquo;by her life within the home, a woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved&rdquo;.  According to the Constitution there is no other way in which a woman can contribute to the common good to anything like the same extent.  If there is any doubt about this the point is reinforced in Article 41.2.2º where the framers of our Constitution decided that women engaged in labour ran the risk of neglecting their duties in the home.  That is the reality of these Articles.</P>
      <P>Why then are the Fine Gael Party content to move a relatively bland and meaningless amendment while allowing Article 41 to stand unchanged?  Surely if their Bill were to pass it would stand alongside another Article in the Constitution which essentially would contradict it in the spirit if not in the letter.  The net effect could well be to render the Fine Gael approach even more meaningless than it is already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties with this Bill do not stop here.  As I said, the Bill confines itself to prohibiting the State from enacting legislation which will discriminate on the grounds of sex, that is, against women because they are women or men because they are men.  Suppose this Bill is passed and its provisions enshrined in the Constitution and at some stage in future the Government decided to enact legislation aimed at facilitating positive discrimination in favour of women &mdash; for example, <Col N="846" /> compelling every State agency and large enterprise to reserve three places on their boards of directors for women &mdash; under the Fine Gael wording now suggested such legislation could clearly be construed as discriminating against men.  If it were so construed, the legislation would then be struck down.  In other words, this legislation proposed by Fine Gael is designed, I assume inadvertently, to prevent positive discrimination in favour of women.  I assume that is not what the drafters of the Bill intended, and I can only comment that they did not think this matter through fully.  What they have prepared is a Bill which could, if passed, defeat its own purpose.</P>
    <P>The Bill if passed could then be the subject of a referendum.  I have no way of knowing what forces would come into play in the course of such a referendum campaign.  We all know what can happen with referenda and experience elsewhere has not been happy.  For example, most feminists would agree that the attempt to enshrine equal rights amendments into the US Constitution set back the cause of feminism rather than promoted it and has unleashed all sorts of reactionary forces whose interests are in preserving and promoting a system of inequality.</P>
    <P>To sum up, as drafted this legislation is ill-advised.  It is badly thought out, incompetent and may be dangerous. Even if it is amended to make sense and then passed, a great deal of further legislation would be needed to give effect to its provisions.  To make matters worse, none of what is proposed here is necessary. The only way to deal with the issue of equality is to legislate for it within the existing Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is a Bill already before this House which has none of the drawbacks in this proposed legislation and would be more far-reaching in its consequences.  I am referring to the Equal Status Bill which has been published by the Labour Party, which we intend to have debated very shortly, and I hope everybody in the House will have an opportunity to comment on and criticise it.  We have consulted a wide range of groups and organisations who may have an interest in the subject of equality and anti-discrimination legislation and since our Bill <Col N="847" /> was published it has been widely recognised by everybody in that area as important and potentially historic.</P>
    <P>The issue is generally seen as involving women as an exploited minority, even though they are a majority and not a minority.  Our Bill is aimed at ending exploitation of women, but there are other oppressed minorities and our Bill aims to include many of them.  Our aim is to end discrimination whether based on sex, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, nationality and national or ethnic origin, including members of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>The traditional approach to discrimination has been to regard it as a feature of the workplace.  Our Bill recognises that much remains to be done to ensure equality at work, but it goes further to aim at discrimination in education, the provision of goods and facilities, services including recreational, banking and other financial services, entertainment, accommodation, transport, the services of any trade or profession and the disposal of premises.  These are ambitious, far-reaching objectives but I am convinced they are realistic.  The debate about equality has been going on since the early seventies but discrimination against minorities still exists.</P>
    <P>There is a fund of goodwill in Ireland towards the principle of equality, yet Governments have been very slow to translate that goodwill into action. Indeed, we have tended to follow rather than lead in this area, often waiting for European directives before we act as legislators at home.  The need for change is obvious.  This has been highlighted in a number of reports, including the reports of the Council for the Status of Women and the Employment Equality Agency, and it is disappointing that the Government have contented themselves with the appointment of another commission.  No matter how well intentioned and busy that new commission will be, it will be possibly another two years before there is a call on the Government to act.  We believe action over a wider range than that envisaged by the Government in their terms of reference or by the Fine Gael <Col N="848" /> Party in the Bill before us tonight is appropriate.</P>
    <P>We will deal with our own Bill when it comes before the House.  It will deal with three types of discrimination &mdash; direct, indirect and victimisation.  Direct discrimination is self-explanatory; indirect discrimination can arise where, on the surface the same conditions apply to men and women but are geared to ensure that a higher proportion of one sex can meet them.  For example, unless an employer who advertises for machine operators and makes it a condition that all applicants must be over 6 feet in height can prove that was an essential height for dealing with the machines, he could be guilty of indirect discrimination against women. Our Bill will also define as discrimination the victimisation of anyone who asserts his or her rights under the legislation. Within a Bill under the existing Constitution we would attack the problems caused by indiscriminate and discriminate interpretations of existing sections of the Constitution. This Bill does not meet that problem and there are dangers in it.  As a matter of principle, however, the Labour Party are committed to supporting this Bill on Second Stage and if it passes that we will be tabling major amendments on Committee Stage to ensure that what the party are trying to achieve will not be lost.</P>

      <P>I welcome my first opportunity to speak on a special Bill which pertains particularly to women.  I am reminded of the following quotation:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can it be pretended that women who manage an estate or conduct a business &mdash; who pay rates and taxes to a large amount, and frequently from their own earnings &mdash; many of whom <Col N="849" /> are respectable heads of families, and some of whom in the capacity of schoolmistresses, teach much more than a great number of male electors ever learnt &mdash; are not capable of a function, of which every male householder is capable?  Or is it feared that if they were admitted to the suffrage, they would revolutionise the State, would deprive us of our valued institutions, or we would have worse laws, or be in any way whatever worse governed, through the effects of their suffrage?</P>
    <P>These words were spoken by the economist John Stuart Mill in the House of Commons in London on 20 May 1867 on an amendment to remove the word &ldquo;man&rdquo; in the Representation of the People Bill and to insert instead the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  They serve to give us a valuable insight into the position of women in the system of evolving parliamentarian democracy and western society towards the end of the last century and give us some notion of the attitude towards women in the matter of politics and of the State at that time.  It is significant proof of the subordinate position of women in public affairs, of the absence of any notion of women's franchise and of the subservient position held by women in society 120 years ago.  Interestingly, that amendment was lost.</P>
    <P>We might be inclined this evening to congratulate ourselves on coming a long way in the past 120 years.  In certain ways we have made tremendous progress. Much of what has been achieved by women in society has been through the voluntary endeavours of women's organisations outside the political arena.  Only when there was an appreciation of the influence that women could exert in the field of social change did people realise the acuteness of the inequalities to be addressed and the need for positive action within the legislative process. There has been tremendous work since the Government came into office in 1987 to promote and act upon their commitment to the principle of equality between the sexes.  I participated with many of my esteemed female colleagues on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights.  I congratulate that committee on <Col N="850" /> their work since 1987 and on their pain-staking commitment to highlighting continuing inequalities in society which need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Council for the Status of Women was established in 1972 and many of their recommendations have been implemented, especially in the field of employment and family law reform.  The most useful and helpful follow-through has been the establishment this year of a new Council for the Status of Women which will give direction to us as legislators as to what our priorities should be in the next decade.</P>
    <P>An important matter is the provision of childcare and créche facilities as the norm in society, not just for the privileged few who can afford them.  Society is continually evolving and as a young woman I believe one of the greatest needs for women generally is the provision of these facilities, not only in urban areas but throughout rural society as well.</P>
    <P>The role of the Employment Equality Agency should be extended to cover many other aspects of life.  They have the ability to ensure that equality is achieved in all areas of Irish life.  I hope the new council will recommend an extension of the role of the Employment Equality Agency so that they can follow up particular cases.  An agency such as the Employment Equality Agency or a committee similar to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights could act as a watchdog to ensure that the recommendations of the new council will be implemented in promoting the equality of the sexes.</P>
    <P>Until women achieve an economic and social identity which is perceived by them and by society as separate from but equal to that of men they will not stand on equal terms with men in the professional and political life of society.  The Bill before us will not achieve that objective. It will place women in the invidious position of being different.  That is not equality and should not be the aim of those who wish to promote the equality of women and men.  Greater political participation by women would help to achieve the objective of equality.  Coming to Dáil Éireann it was quite daunting to see <Col N="851" /> so few lady Members.  Greater participation by women in all aspects of political life, be it at local level, county council level, as members of health boards or State committees and within the Oireachtas, would lead to more equality legislation.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the views of more women on all types of legislation.  It would not necessarily have to be employment but agriculture, fisheries, or any other area of legislation.  If we had greater participation by women within the political process this would help towards achieving our aims.  I believe every Member of this House would like to see this happen.  I heard Deputy Gay Mitchell say he has a family and that he would like his children whether male or female to have the same opportunity as anybody else.  We all wish to achieve that. Perhaps some of us have obtained the opportunity to enter politics.  Perhaps one of the Deputy's daughters will go into politics, we do not know, or perhaps the Deputy will have sense and will tell them not to go into politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <P>Our aim is towards equality of opportunity.  I do not want to be put on a pedestal.  If the opportunity is there and I have the ability to achieve and take advantage of the opportunity, I consider that equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many ways in which positive discrimination, or affirmative action as the Americans call it, can help towards greater participation among political parties and thus greater participation in the Dáil or greater promotion opportunities in organisations.  In the banks for example there are very few women managers or women at the higher ranks in the organisation. Again, there are many women in the teaching profession but few are principal teachers.  Perhaps we need to look at that.  The problem for many women is that men lack confidence in them and in their ability to do the job that men do themselves.  I hope we do not reach the situation where this ongoing saga would <Col N="852" /> cause women to lose confidence in themselves. Women in Ireland have the ability, the tenacity and the confidence to achieve total equality.  I hope that with ongoing debate like we have in this House this evening, despite the fact that the Government parties will be opposing the Bill, ongoing debate within the media, greater awareness, and better education, we will come to the stage where we will reach equality in a number of years from now.  Perhaps then the entire phenomenon can be relegated to the history books.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the fact that the Government decided not to oppose the introduction of this Private Members' Bill.  Despite the views expressed here tonight that the legislation is flawed and badly thought out, which in many cases it is, nevertheless it gives us an opportunity to discuss the whole area of equality and the role of women generally in society.</P>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Coughlan's contribution.  Generally, the contribution of women TDs in this House shows that they have a great role to play in legislation and in the development of this country.</P>
      <P>In many ways the role of women has been totally underestimated over many years.  In my constituency, particularly in the area I come from, Enniscorthy, women generally are to the forefront in most, if not all, of the voluntary organisations that operate in the area.  Indeed, they play a major role in pre-school play-groups which are not part of the State education structure.  No Government, for different reasons, have seen any great reason to legislate for pre-schooling. However, the women who run play-schools provide an unique opportunity for young children to develop and prepare for school and they do this every morning without any great support, help or funding.  We, the politicians, should seek to make funding available whether through the national lottery or any other agency to help this along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office in 1989 this Government have taken significant steps to translate in to practice their commitment to the principles of equality between the sexes.  The Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="853" /> Geoghegan-Quinn, who unfortunately is not here tonight, has the role of co-ordinating all aspects of Government policy as they affect women.  There is no doubt she has played a major role in highlighting the inequalities and problems faced by women.  She is held in high regard on the European and on the world scene as a Minister and she has made it a major issue to provide the necessary requirements for equality and to give the women of this country and indeed women in the EC a fair deal.  We should place on record our appreciation of her great role in that area and I hope she will continue to speak out loud and in an honest way on the role of developing equality between the sexes.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1973, the Taoiseach is on record as seeking to establish a committee of this House to examine and develop the status of women in our society.  He vowed to re-establish under the current Dáil the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  Women Deputies from all sides of the House are on that committee.  I compliment them on the role they have played in making recommendations, carrying out investigations and making worthwhile contributions to the legislation introduced in this House in recent times.  I think this committee is unique in the 12 member states of the European Community.  I may be incorrect but I have been told on many occasions that this is the only Committee on Women's Rights operating in any of the parliaments of the EC.  That in itself shows that this Government and the previous Government were committed to the development of women's rights and the promotion of equality of the sexes.  I hope the committee will continue to make recommendations and will examine different aspects of equality.  We have gone a long way down the road but obviously we need to go further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris pointed out that we must be careful not to introduce contradictory legislation which defeats the purpose of what is intended.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to establish a second Commission on the Status of Women to undertake a stock-taking exercise in an objective way and to make concrete and practical recommendations for progress in the future. <Col N="854" /> They have to consider and make recommendations on the means, administrative and legislative, by which women will be able to participate on equal terms and conditions with men in the economic, social, political and cultural life and to this end to consider the efficiency and feasibility of positive action measures. We have already seen measures on part-time work undertaken by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, in the Social Welfare Act, as practically 80 per cent of the part-time workers in this country are women.  We have had a debate in this House in recent weeks when Members from all sides contributed, outlining the resources they felt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank you for allowing me, Sir, contribute to this adjournment debate in regard to the deferral of a public inquiry into the siting of a marina in the town of Dingle.  I might give the House some indication of events leading up to the calling of this public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 12 March 1990 local people saw a public advertisement in the newpapers to the effect that the local Dingle Skelligs Hotel was seeking permission, under the provisions of the Foreshore Act, 1933, for the lease of a portion of the foreshore. It will be appreciated that any interference with the foreshore in any part of this country can be a very sensitive and emotional matter.  Following that public announcement the local Chamber of Commerce, harbour board and tourist interests on three occasions sought an opportunity to discuss the merits and demerits of the proposition with the Minister for the Marine.  Regrettably, there was no response to their requests. Therefore, it became incumbent on the Chamber of Commerce, and the leading body representing the citizens of Dingle, to write to the Department on 15 August 1990 demanding a public sworn inquiry <Col N="855" /> arising from the 1933 Act before the Department could concede any lease to anybody.  That demand was posted on 15 August 1990 but the matter rested there until 6 March 1991 when a public notice was issued in the newspapers to the effect that a public sworn inquiry was about to be convened in the Hillgrove Hotel in Dingle at 10 a.m. on 10 April 1991.</P>
    <P>Following that announcement the people associated with the Chamber of Commerce and other bodies set themselves the task &mdash; through a local firm of solicitors, E. M. Burke and Company of Green Street, Dingle &mdash; of assembling all the professional, legal, Senior and Junior Counsel, engineering, planning and ancillary services personnel.  A series of consultations, correspondence and communications was engaged in and those opposed to the siting of a marina in the vicinity of the Dingle Skelligs Hotel finally assembled at 10 a.m. on 10 April 1991.  All this involved immense cost in terms of capacity and resources to bodies such as the Dingle Chamber of Commerce and harbour board.</P>
    <P>It was with tremendous surprise and anger that the firm representing the community demanding this public inquiry learned, midday on Monday, some 36 hours before the inquiry was due to begin, that a caller to the solicitor's office had told them that he had heard on Raidio na Gaeltachta, on the midday news, that the inquiry had been either postponed or cancelled.  The legal representative, having processed the case on behalf of the local community, felt deeply aggrieved.  In spite of any queries he made over the ensuing two or three hours, he received no information except that obtained from the Hillgrove Hotel who had been notified that the inquiry had been deferred, as was the solicitor from Listowel dealing with the Dingle Skelligs Hotel.  He telephoned the legal representatives of the Chamber of Commerce to so inform them.  It was not until almost 6 o'clock that evening that the main advocate received confirmation of what was happening.  At a public meeting, well attended on that evening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is for that reason I raise the matter on the Adjournment this evening, requesting the Minister to endeavour to explain why there had been an adjournment in the first instance and in the second, why the party mainly concerned with the submission of the adjournment was practically omitted from the notification which gave rise to considerable anger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that the inquiry has now been rescheduled for Wednesday, 15 May next. The background to this matter is that in Octomber 1989 an application was made to the Department of the Marine for a lease under the Foreshore Act, 1933, to reclaim an area of foreshore at Dingle, County Kerry for the purpose of constructing a marina and ancillary development. Following public notification of the proposal, a number of objections were received by the Department.</P>
      <P>Having given the matter careful consideration it was decided some months ago, in exercise of the powers conferred on the Minister by the Foreshore Act, 1933, that a public inquiry into the application should be held before a decision was made.  Accordingly the Minister appointed an independent chairman, and set the date of the inquiry for Wednesday, 10 April.</P>
      <P>On the morning of Monday, 8 April last, an application was made to the Department of the Marine by the applicants for the foreshore lease that the inquiry be postponed because two key witnesses had become unavailable unexpectedly for the appointed day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of establishing the inquiry had been to allow for public presentation of all the relevant facts and points of view, so as to facilitate an informed final decision on the application.  As this was unlikely to be achieved in the absence of two key participants on behalf of the <Col N="857" /> promoter, it was decided to accede to their request and postpone the inquiry.</P>
    <P>Every measure was then taken by my Department to ensure that all parties were informed about the postponement. The promoters and main objectors were notified on the evening of Monday, 8 April, by fax, telephone or letter; a press release on the matter was issued; the postponement was advertised on both Kerry Radio and Raidio na Gaeltachta and a notice placed in the local <i>Examiner</i> of Tuesday, 9 April.  On Tuesday, 9 April, solicitors representing some of the objectors applied to the High Court for a mandatory injunction compelling the Department to proceed with the inquriy as originally scheduled.  This application was refused.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset, I am pleased to announce that the inquiry has been rescheduled for Wednesday, 15 May next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The present rate of payment is about £35 per head up to a maximum of 90 cattle.  All in all we understand that as many as 8,000 beef farmers have been denied payment in respect of the year 1990 where this premium is concerned.  The form is quite explicit and there should not have been any problem but, first and foremost, we are not a great nation of form-fillers and many people who made minor mistakes are paying dearly for doing so.  The biggest problem with regard to the payment <Col N="858" /> of this premium is that if one sells any cattle within two months of an application one is automatically disqualified from receiving the premium in respect of any of the herd.  This is the kernel of the problem.</P>
      <P>In my constituency I have had approaches from as many as 50 farmers in the past couple of months who have been disqualified from receiving this premium. This is causing considerable difficulty. If one takes an average of 25 cattle in a herd affected and about 8,000 farmers one can see we are losing £6 million or £7 million in the country: the State is losing that amount of EC money.</P>
      <P>The Minister should request the EC Commission to allow applications where it can be clearly proven that the cattle were got rid of within the two months and where the sale can be proved through documentation.  That should not be too difficult.  It would certainly ease the plight of the people who are being disqualified. I am aware that the farming organisations have made a similar plea and I do not know what has been the response.  I do not know if the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, has taken up the matter with the Commission in Brussels.  If not, I would appreciate if he would do so.  I would like to know whether an application for an easing of the regulations has been made to the Commission in Brussels.</P>
      <P>Where there is documentary evidence of the sale within the two months the premium should be paid.  It amounts to a considerable amount of money for some farmers.  They badly need the money and they can ill afford the loss.  It is unfair and unwise that people should be disqualified from receiving fairly considerable amounts of money over a minor technicality.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Deasy for allowing me to share his time.  The rigid operation of the special beef premium scheme is causing anger and frustration and, most important, is causing hardship to farmers.  We will have to accept that the administration of the scheme is far too severe and rigid, to such an extent that absolutely no flexibility is allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> The difficulties with the scheme can be seen from the fact that up to 8,000 farmers, as Deputy Deasy has said, will lose out in payments because of minor technicalities.  Undoubtedly that proves there is need for more flexibility and a change in the scheme as administered at present.  If one looks at the scheme one can describe it as nothing other than a fiasco.  In this day and age of declining incomes it is appalling that farmers who have no intention of not abiding by the rules and find themselves in such severe financial hardship that they have to sell animals are shown no compassion or flexibility in the dealing of their cases. Farmers who have come to me have shown an alarming lack of information regarding the rules of the scheme.  It is very hard for farmers in the south to accept this considering that the rules for eligibility under the scheme are more flexible and less rigid in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, the problem is compounded by the enormous delays by the Department of Agriculture and Food in paying out the grants.  This is unfair, unjust and uncaring because in many cases the payment of the grant is the difference between survival or collapse for the farmers.  The Minister must look at this scheme very closely and demand flexibility.</P>

The main reason for the refusal of the 1990 special beef premium was the failure of applicants to respect the two month retention period which is a condition of the relevant regulation.</P>
      <P>The Commission agreed to allow Ireland a large degree of flexibility in operating this scheme this year given that we were changing from a full-time on farm inspection system to part-time inspections. Because it is an EC scheme they were adamant that the two month retention period should be respected.  I am not terribly satisfied with the way the premium scheme operates.  I want to confirm that a case is being processed at present to the Commission to have the conditions changed for the future.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise with the Minister the difficulties being experienced by members of the public who require the signature of a member of the Garda Síochána on passport application forms. I experienced the great difficulties facing ordinary members of the public when I accompanied a young man to his local Garda station on his fourth attempt to get a Garda to sign the certificate of identity. This young man had tried unsuccessfully on three occasions, once accompanied by his father and carrying with him a birth certificate and the garda refused to sign the form on the grounds that he was not known personally to the garda.  This man lives only 350 yards from the Garda station. Clearly this highlights the fact that in big urban areas it is not possible for the gardaí to know everybody.  It is now <Col N="861" /> proving easier for a person with a criminal record than a law abiding citizen to have a passport application form signed.  For example, the public office in the Garda station I visited had no less then four notices on doors and windows with a ten point directive to applicants for passports issued by the Garda Síochána.  It has been pointed out to me also that the ten point directive contains lots of waffle and is negative in its advice.  Point No. 10 indicates that your identity is the central ingredient of your passport.  It reads: &ldquo;Please do not expect the Garda to certify it on production of a driving licence or similar document made out in your name&rdquo;.  Points 4 and 5 state that if you are not known to the certifying garda your co-operation will be required in establishing your identity when presenting your application form.  The Garda have quite rightly asked what formula or directive is there for them to prove the identity of the applicant.  Point 5 states that it will avoid delay and unnecessary inquiry if you present your application form to a Garda station where you are known &mdash; many people are not known in a Garda station &mdash; or where your identity can be readily confirmed.  The Garda again say that no directive has been given to them as to how they can easily confirm the identity of the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now entering the busy holiday period when many people will be applying for passports.  I hope that after tonight's debate the Minister will bring about the following changes which will allow the ordinary citizen rights at least equal to those of the criminal who clearly has no difficulty in proving his identity.  I am calling on the Minister to allow the same range of professionals to certify the identity of passport applicants as is the case outside the State.  Public representatives should be given the right to sign certificates of identity.  An applicant outside the State can have the choice of the signature of a clergyman, medical doctor, school principal, bank manager or assistant bank manager, practising lawyer, policeman, magistrate or judge.  I would also ask the Minister to clear up the confusion for both the Garda and members of the public by instructing the Garda to <Col N="862" /> accept the following documents as proof of identity: old or expired passports, driving licence with a photograph &mdash; that is the modern-type driving licence &mdash; birth certificate accompanied by a bankers card and any other documentation that the Minister believes is appropriate.  I would like to emphasise that the parent of an applicant should be allowed authorise the identity of his or her family member.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, given the recent disparaging remarks made by a District Court Judge, about Crumlin which is my constituency, I would like an assurance from the Minister that it is not the policy of the Garda to operate two standards when dealing with requests for signatures, one for the people from the more affluent areas of the city and another for those in working class districts.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House will appreciate that a passport is a very important means of establishing identity when the holder is abroad.  In fact, in most cases, it is the only means available to do so.  It is in the interests of the State and of all Irish citizens that the Irish passport should have a good international reputation and be readily accepted by the authorities of other states.  I understand that the Irish passport booklet in its production and manufacture meets the highest international standards and that various security elements are built in during its production. These security features are, I am informed, constantly being updated.  However to preserve the integrity and reputation of the Irish passport these standards must be matched by the care taken to ensure that the processing of applications for passports is conducted in the most secure environment possible.  As a result all passport applications must be accompanied by documentary evidence of the applicant's identity and citizenship.</P>

      <P>A necessary part of this process is the certification of an applicant's true identity.  Regrettably a system of certification based, say, only on a birth <Col N="863" /> certificate or a statement signed by a witness would not be reliable enough as such documentation can easily be obtained by anybody wishing to defraud the system.</P>
      <P>Previously certification was performed by people of some standing in the community as well as by the Garda Síochána. Unfortunately this system proved unsatisfactory when a number of cases were uncovered involving such certification where fraudulent passport applications were lodged.  In order to limit the number of such applications to the greatest extent possible it was decided to confine such certification to the Garda alone.  The position is that if a garda does not know an applicant personally he may have him identified by another member of the force or by a reputable member of the public known to the identifying garda.  As a result I believe that considerable progress has been made in eliminating passport application fraud.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the public an application form may be presented at a Garda station in the area where the applicant works or resides or where the applicant formerly worked or resided.  Indeed the applicant may present the form at any Garda station. Needless to say it avoids delay when the applicant presents the application form at a Garda station where the identity of the applicant can be readily confirmed. I am very pleased that Deputy Byrne has confirmed that in at least four places in the Garda station to which he referred the relevant Garda notice containing the ten points was posted publicly so that people would be aware of the position.</P>

      <P>This confirms the co-operation of the Garda in facilitating the public.  However, it is inevitable that there will be some complaints about the system &mdash; we have heard one vexatious complaint here tonight &mdash; particularly in view of the large number of applications processed each year.  Approximately 180,000 passports are issued by the Passport Office in Dublin every year.  I believe <Col N="864" /> however that the complaints are relatively few in comparison with the number of applications made.  I can assure the House that the Garda are doing everything possible to ensure that the system runs smoothly.  To this end the Garda authorities produced a leaflet which is designed to assist the applicant when making his application.  These leaflets are available to the public in the Passport Office and at all Garda stations, as Deputy Byrne has confirmed.  The Garda authorities have assured me that the present arrangements are working satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>It concerns me to hear a Member of this House state that it is now easier for a criminal than for a law abiding citizen to get a passport application signed.  This is totally untrue, and nobody is entitled to make such a statement.  The Garda treat every application on its merits. There must be clear identification.  We cannot have fraudulent passports issued. If Deputy Byrne wants a particular case investigated he should bring the information either to myself or to the Minister for Justice and we will have the investigation carried out.  I want to assure the Deputy and the House that under no circumstances is there discrimination, nor are delaying tactics of any kind used by the Garda in their administration of this very excellent scheme.  I thank them sincerely for their tremendous co-operation with the Passport Office.</P>

      <P>Tarbert comprehensive school was opened in 1974.  It was then designed to accommodate 520 pupils. However it has since grown to a 670 pupil school.  An extension was approved by the Department of Education in 1975-76. However, whereas this overcame the <Col N="865" /> overcrowding problem somewhat, the problem still remains for certain practical subjects.  Since 1974 the school has used the same facilities for technical drawing, engineering and building construction. To facilitate all students who require these subjects it is essential that there are two rooms for each of the above subjects, one for junior cycle and one for senior cycle.  As this is a very progressive school I would implore the Minister to treat the application as sympathetically as possible.</P>
      <P>In regard to Ballybunion convent, the board of management had to go ahead with essential works, including the replacement of windows and other essential repairs.  Again, I would like to ask the Minister to treat their application as sympathetically as possible.  In the past the teachers there have proven to be very hard working and very committed to their school.  As a result the school has grown out of all proportions and is supplying a very good service.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Deenihan that Tarbert is a progressive school with progressive teachers and I am glad that he raised this matter.  He is quite right, there was an extension in the years 1985-86 but it did not allow for the full growth of the school.  We are at present examining the developed sketch scheme for the project and, when this stage has been passed, the detailed design will then have to be submitted and examined.  It allows for the two technical rooms of which the Deputy spoke and other ancillary accommodation and classrooms.  The need will be in the medium to long term <Col N="866" /> to cater for 625 to 650 pupils but when the additional work is done I will be reviewing the matter.  I should certainly like to get the work started when all the planning stages are completed.</P>

      <P>As the Minister knows, the windows in Ballybunion convent have been replaced and other essential works had to be carried out.  In the past the authorities were very effective and are serving the area very well educationally. I appeal to the Minister to treat this application as sympathetically as possible as the board of management and the authorities are hard pressed for funds. They find it very difficult to maintain their school in a proper fashion because it is in a very exposed area with the Atlantic winds blowing over it.  I ask the Minister to treat this as a special case.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for putting his case so well, indeed he serves his area well.  As he knows, the school have transgressed the rules; they sent in a report on the need for the work and we immediately wrote back telling them to send the details. Subsequently, we discovered that work to the value of £8,300 had been done without permission.  The system of retrospective grants has been abolished for some time.  What has been prepared for me contains a vehement &ldquo;no&rdquo; but in view of the case put forward by Deputy Deenihan and because of the work done by the good sisters who look after educational interests so well in that area, I will give the matter further consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be in continuation of the spirit of the debate up to <Col N="867" /> now.  Snipe Avenue School, Newcastle, Galway city, for mentally handicapped children consists of eight or nine prefab buildings catering for 90 pupils from Galway city and county.  Some of those buildings are 25 years old and are leaking very badly.  It makes it impossible for teachers and pupils to operate efficiently.</P>
      <P>A campaign has been conducted by the Galway Association for Mentally Handicapped to have a new school erected on the site.  In March 1989 there was a great breakthrough when the Minister &mdash; and indeed the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey &mdash; came down to the school and in a fanfare of public relations announced sanction for the building of a new school.  That was before the last general election and now, over two years later, despite the full co-operation of the promoters, we cannot find out if, and when, this school will start.  Are they waiting for another election?  Are the Minister, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, using the pupils of this school as pawns in their games?  The school was supposed to go to tender last December and on 21 January I put down a Dáil question to the Minister in this regard.  I was assured there would be a decision in relation to this matter in three weeks but three months later I am still trying to establish the position.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government are treating mentally handicapped children and their parents as second-class citizens and, as Fine Gael spokesman on mentally handicapped and special education, I will not stand for it.  Why did the Government cut the budget to the Galway Association for Mentally Handicapped by £500,000? How can the association run the service with this treatment?  It is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State also proposes to close the school for mentally handicapped children at the Brothers of Charity, Renmore.  Let him attack the people who can defend themselves and leave the underprivileged alone.  The people of Galway are watching him.  The Minister and the Government have no regard for the underprivileged and they will pay the price.  I am now asking the Minister, once and for all, to clearly spell out when the <Col N="868" /> school for mentally handicapped at Snipe Avenue will get the go-ahead after several false promises over the last two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has been trenchantly put but with many errors and misconceptions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, spent of lot of time and effort in attending in great detail to the whole issue of services for the handicapped in Galway city and county and indeed throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I cannot allow the false and spurious allegations by Deputy McCormack in regard to the Government's commitment to the handicapped to go unchallenged. We have attended to our duties with a great sense of devotion and dedication.  I have been in Snipe Avenue and I did not bring any PR as I do my own.  I am sure the same applies to the Minister of State. I met the parents on five occasions, indeed I met them last Saturday at my home, and I very much share their hopes and wishes that the school at Snipe Avenue, which for many years in the eighties was totally neglected, will soon come to fruition.  When we came to office there was no planning process in relation to this school and there was no thought for the future of these children.  The present position is that the tender documents are practically completed, including the bills of quantities, but some structural drawings for the roof and foundations need to be prepared before the project is fully ready for tender.  I have arranged that the remaining documents will be completed with the minimum of delay and then we will proceed with the invitation to tender.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, would like to have been here tonight as the question dealt with his constituency and his special interest.  He is on Government business but I am very glad to reverse the position, so to speak, and to stand in for him.  I assure the Deputy that it is his care and dedication which has led to the school reaching this point of preparedness.</P>

      <P>The combined schools in Kildimo, Pallaskenry and Kilcoran have a roll of over 547 pupils, 90 of whom are in need of remedial teaching. Requests have been made to successive Governments since 1980 from the school for a remedial teacher for the three schools combined.  Part of their difficulty is that neighbouring schools in other centres had the benefit of remedial teachers and indeed one of the schools &mdash; Kildimo &mdash; lost quite a few pupils to a neighbouring school which had that facility.  In the review which I think will take place again this year will the Minister favourably consider the application which I know is on her file from those three combined schools and possibly consider appointing a remedial teacher?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, as Deputy Finucane knows, approximately 3,500 primary schools in the country, of which 1,100 have the services of a remedial teacher or share one.  There are 900 remedial teachers in the primary educational system so that means that over 2,000 applications are on hand.  This coming September we will be appointing 80 remedial teachers which, combined with the 30 we apportioned last year, is more in two years than in the combined four years previously &mdash; and I do not say this in a party political way.  It does mean that it is on a scale of priorities that these teachers will be appointed.  Many Deputies write to me and put down questions about the appointment of remedial teachers. Obviously I would not have the specific knowledge of each school that makes an application.  We depend on the skills of our divisional and district inspectors who make the visits when the application is received, make assessments of the <Col N="870" /> pupils and submit those to the deputy head inspector who puts them in the order of priority.  I want to make this clear because I happened, by accident, to read in a particular local paper that a certain Deputy claimed that these were appointed politically.  I receive the professional advice of my inspectors and I go along with it exactly because I would not have the specific knowledge of each pupil's ability, or perhaps slight disability, and would therefore not be able to make my own judgment on it.</P>
      <P>I am assured that all of the applications which have been made, and which would include the Deputy's case, will be examined in the assessment procedure and arranged in the order of priority.  I hope it will be possible to facilitate the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will continue in the same generous vein and finally bring to an end the long-running saga of the proposed extension to the Patrician Academy school in Mallow.</P>
      <P>The Minister is by now fully aware of the failure of her Department to announce a start-up date for the extension to this school.  It is causing grave concern to the parents of the area, to the school management, but most of all to the 450 pupils in the Patrician Academy. The Minister is also fully aware that the present building complex has been condemned by the fire and safety officers. There is a danger that unless the extension goes ahead in the very near future the situation may arise that the school authorities will have no option but to close the school, such is its present condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were very pleased last April when the Minister personally visited the school and saw for herself the appalling conditions under which the teachers work and the pupils learn.  We were very glad that shortly afterwards an announcement was made that an extension would be sanctioned.  The project was allowed go to tender in December 1990.  Particulars were received in the Minister's Department in February 1991 but unfortunately nothing has happened since then and nothing has been heard by the school authorities.  We are informed that this is a most unusual delay and it is causing <Col N="871" /> great concern to the school authorities and to the parents.</P>
    <P>In response to a written Dáil Question I was told by the Minister that the school authorities were meeting with senior officials of her Department today to discuss the matter further.  Unfortunately, whilst that meeting did go ahead, the basic difficulty as to the start-up date of the project was not really addressed and the school authorities are still waiting to be informed when the building will go ahead.</P>
    <P>My brief demands are that the Minister would give an absolute commitment that the project will go ahead in 1991, that the Minister will indicate that the money is available in her Department for the project and, most important, that she will be able to state here tonight when the project will go ahead and hopefully that it will go ahead before the summer.</P>
    <P>I look forward with great anticipation to a positive reply which will bring to an end this long running saga that I discussed with the Minister while I was a Senator, that I discussed on Cork County Council, and that I am now bringing before Dáil Éireann.  I appeal to the Minister to send me home with the sort of goods news that she gave to Deputy Deenihan, and I can assure her that her popularity will increase dramatically in the Mallow area.</P>

In all successful cases my Department took all necessary steps to ensure that the farmer was given the revised classification.  The question of payment is, of course, a matter solely for negotiation between the individual producers and the factory.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 61 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The financial allocation to cover the cost of the free food scheme in each member state is decided on by the EC. The quantity of beef available, therefore, is determined by this allocation.  As the quantity of beef available is limited it is necessary, in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare, to identify those beneficiaries who are considered to be in the greatest financial need.  If this were not done, the quantity provided for each beneficiary would be insignificant.</P>
      <P>The scheme for 1990 was therefore restricted to recipients of long-term unemployment assistance; recipients of the pre-retirement allowance; recipients of long-term supplementary welfare allowance and FÁS trainees who were in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance immediately prior to commencing their FÁS courses.</P>
      <P>The distribution to the people who fall into those categories excludes social welfare beneficiaries in other categories. This is inevitable given the limited quantities allowed under the Community regulations at present, but I am seeking to have the quantities increased for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a condition of the scheme under <Col N="656" /> Community regulations that the beef is made available to voluntary organisations for distribution to those in need. The Society of St. Vincent De Paul is the only voluntary organisation which have the capability, and is willing to, organise distribution on a national scale.</P>
    <P>The society has branches throughout the country and, in the areas where it is not organised locally, made arrangements to ensure that the beef could be collected at an adjacent centre.  Any eligible person who has not been able to obtain beef under the scheme could contact the nearest society conference, or its head office at 8 Cabra Road, Dublin 7.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 28, 33 and 50 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangement which applied prior to 1990, in respect of FEOGA grants <Col N="657" /> whereby all suitable applications were forwarded to the EC Commission, was altered by Regulation EC No. 866/90 which came into effect during 1990. Under the new arrangement, following notification by the EC Commission of the level of funds available, a selection committee within my Department recommend which applications should be approved for inclusion in an operational programme for submission to the Commission.</P>
    <P>Since the inception of the scheme for potatoes in 1981, 100 per cent of applications considered under the old regime were successful both at Department and EC level.</P>
    <P>Four potato producers applied to my Department for grant aid under the FEOGA grant system in 1990 and fell to be considered under the new arrangements. Three of these have been submitted to the EC Commission.  One has been approved and two approvals are pending.  The fourth application was not included in the 1990 submission to the Commission, because all four applications could not be accommodated in the submissiom.  When the last operational programme was sent to the Commission in April this year that application was then ineligible for consideration on the grounds that it did not comply with the condition laid down in the regulation that work on the project may not have commenced more than six months before receipt of the operational programme by the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>The following are particulars of applications for grants for potato grading and storage facilities approved under the FEOGA scheme from 1989 to date.</P>

      <P>Since our accession to membership of the Community the Irish economy has derived substantial benefits from the existing Common Agricultural Policy.  FEOGA receipts since 1973 have exceeded IR£10 billion.  In addition, the market support mechanisms result in the value of our agricultural exports &mdash; by far the greater proportion of our output &mdash; being almost double what would otherwise be the case.  In the case of consumers, CAP support arrangements have ensured the supply of quality products at price levels which, for many years, have increased at a lesser rate than the general level of inflation.</P>
      <P>This policy derives from principles which are laid down in the Treaty of Rome.  I am satisfied that our interests are best served by a clear adherence to these principles.  While I can accept that the way in which these are implemented could be adjusted in the interests of greater equity and efficiency, the fundamentals of the policy must remain unchanged.  The CAP has served this country well and I will be seeking to ensure that it will continue to do so following the forthcoming review.  The Commission's proposals for this review are expected to be tabled by the summer.</P>
      <P>The formulation of our definitive approach to these proposals must obviously await their formal submission to the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Leader is the EC's initiative on rural development.  The purpose of Leader is to encourage groups in local rural communities to become involved in and to draw up plans for the development of their own areas.  The groups to be financed will be selected by the EC Commission, in consultation with the member state, on the basis of business plans to be drawn up by the groups themselves. Technical assistance funding is expected to be available to help groups in preparing plans.</P>
      <P>Any rural group, public, private or mixed, which satisfies requirements in relation to size of rural area, that is, 5,000 to 100,000 population, and other criteria as to solvency, administrative ability and local representation, is eligible for Leader funding for its integrated business plan.</P>
      <P>The measures eligible for inclusion in business plans are the stimulation of rural development, vocational training and assistance for employment, rural tourism, small firms, craft enterprises and local services, exploitation and marketing of local products and measures relating to the equipment and linking of local development groups.</P>
      <P>The Commission is providing 400 MECU, about £300 million, to fund the Leader programme and it plans to aid about 100 groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no official information so far as to the proportion of the 400 MECU to be allocated to Ireland, the number of Irish plans to be funded, or the ratio of <Col N="661" /> private, national and Community financing which the Commission envisages.</P>
    <P>My objective is to achieve as wide as possible a geographical spread of the Leader funds here subject, of course, to effective use of the funds.  I hope that the Commission will agree to fund around 12 groups in Ireland.  Ideally, I would like to see two groups in each of the six regions &mdash; excluding Dublin &mdash; adopted for the purpose of preparing the National Development Plan 1989-93 under the reformed Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>I am very encouraged that there is already a very high level of public awareness of the Leader initiative.  Media publicity and information provided by my Department has led to a very good understanding of the purpose and philosophy of Leader among rural communities.</P>
    <P>I expect to make an official announcement about Leader very shortly coupled with advertisements in the national papers inviting groups to submit plans for consideration.  Every effort will continue to be made to encourage groups to liaise with others in their region to ensure that coherent and effective plans are prepared.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 Bord na gCon were generally given overall responsibility for the improvement and development of the Irish greyhound industry.  The board were given authority to make regulations regarding the charging of levies on course bets to fund their activities in relation to this function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a close examination of a comprehensive consultants' report on its operations which the board had commissioned in 1989, they prepared a five year development plan for the industry covering the years 1990-94.  To assist the planned development the Government <Col N="662" /> provided a grant-in-aid of £500,000 to Bord na gCon in 1990 and are providing a further £750,000 this year.  At least another £1 million will be provided over the period of the following two years.</P>
    <P>Grant-aid is also now available to the greyhound breeder as part of the operational programme for rural development which was approved by the EC Commission in December 1990.  The scheme for greyhounds provides 50 per cent aid in less favoured areas and 40 per cent elsewhere towards the cost of housing and handling facilities at farm level, subject to an investment ceiling of £5,000.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the agreed Programme for Government, the appeals body set up by me recently will have as one of their functions the task of considering why certain areas have not been included in the disadvantaged areas or have not been reclassified to a more favourable status following the 1989 survey and submission of our case for extension and reclassification to the Ec. In the case of appeal, this body will, of course, have to consider whether or not an exclusion from extension or reclassification was justified.  In that context I would have no objection to disclosure of the specific criteria under which any area was not designated as disadvantaged or reclassified.</P>

      <P>The EC Commission's proposals on farm prices and related measures for 1991-92 were formally presented to the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 4 March.  They were discussed at both Councils during March and were again considered by Agriculture Ministers this week.  Agreement will not be reached in advance of the next Council meeting which is scheduled for 21-22 May, not least because the opinion of the European Parliament &mdash; a prerequisite for formal adoption of any prices package &mdash; is unlikely to be available before then.</P>

    <P>In the Government's view it would not be appropriate for individual member states to seek exemption from the provisions of the Community's annual price fixing, although we shall, of course, seek to influence these in a direction which best suits our national interest.</P>

      <P>There has been no delay in paying the 1990 ewe premium to sheep farmers.  In accordance with the EC Regulations governing the scheme, the premium is payable in two half-yearly instalments of 30 per cent of the expected premium during the year in question and the balance of 40 per cent is to be paid in the following year as soon as the amount of the final premium has been determined. In accordance with these arrangements, payment of the first instalment of £6.53 commenced in July 1990, and payment of the second instalment of £7.22 commenced in October 1990.  The regulation fixing the 40 per cent balance of premium was dated 11 April 1991 and payments of that balance of £9.95 commenced on 18 April 1991 and will continue for the next week or two.</P>

      <P>At the European Council on 8 April it was agreed that the Community and its member states would provide 150 million ECUs as a contribution to international relief efforts.  Of the total, 100 <Col N="680" /> million ECUs would be provided through the Community budget and 50 million ECUs directly by member states.  The Commission will co-ordinate the member states direct contributions but it was not decided that these funds should be channelled through the Community.</P>
      <P>Ireland's contribution to the total 150 million ECUs is approximately £1 million, as announced by the Taoiseach on 8 April.  However, in the light of the scale of the crisis and the continuing need for aid, the Government are providing £1.235 million which is significantly in excess of this.  They have also arranged for some civilian aircraft to be provided free of charge by the operators for the delivery of supplies to the affected areas.</P>
      <P>Our share of the European Community budget contribution is £685,000 and the balance of £550,000, which is being provided bilaterally, is made up as follows: £200,000, Irish Red Cross: relief supplies for refugees in Iran; £100,000, Trócaire: relief supplies for refugees in Iran; £150,000, United Nations High Commissioner for refugees: relief operations for the refugees generally; £100,000, CONCERN: relief supplies for refugees in Turkey.</P>

      <P>The Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, (S.I. 340 of 1989), which govern the operation of the disabled drivers scheme are currently being reviewed in accordance with a commitment previously given in the House.  As part of that review all aspects of the operation and conditions of the scheme are being examined to ensure that it is, as far as is possible, fair and equitable to all concerned, within the financial constraints which must, of necessity, apply.</P>

      <P>The main reason for the refusal of the 1990 special beef premium was the failure of the applicant to respect the two month retention period which is a condition of the relevant regulation.

      <P>These schemes are fully funded by the EC and member states have very little flexibility in administering them.  However, when I became aware late last year that many farmers would be excluded from the 1990 special beef premium scheme because application forms had not been properly completed I had my officials contact the Commission and succeeded in getting concessions which allowed many farmers who would otherwise be excluded from payment to receive payment.  Unfortunately, the Commission were adamant that the two month retention period must be respected and inevitably, therefore, some farmers will not receive the premium this year because they fail to comply with this condition.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the livestock headage schemes in disadvantaged areas that applicants comply fully with the provisions of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, and any official schemes for eradication of animal disease.  Since large amounts of public money have been and continue to be spent on eradicating animal disease, I consider it entirely reasonable that the farm improvement and disadvantaged areas schemes, which are also partially funded by the Exchequer, should contain such a condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> In deciding whether livestock and other grants should be withheld in any particular case, regard will be had for any court decisions affecting such matters.</P>
    <P>The regulations governing the EC suckler cow, special beef premium and ewe premium schemes &mdash; which are fully funded by the EC &mdash; do not provide for the withholding of grants for infringements of animal health regulations and grants due under these schemes are not withheld from herdowners for non-compliance with disease eradication schemes.</P>

    <P>The following are other studies on energy conservation in the home:</P>
    <P>&mdash;An Foras Forbartha (now the Environmental Research Unit) carried out experimental measurements of comfort conditions and heating system efficiencies in typical households. A number of reports were published from 1975-88.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The ESRI has carried out analyses of patterns of, and factors affecting, <Col N="707" /> energy use in households e.g. domestic electricity demand.  Report recently published.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Environmental Research Unit, on behalf of the Department of the Environment, has recently conducted a review of thermal performance standards for buildings, including housing, in the context of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Not published.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The IIRS, on behalf of the Construction Industry Federation, produced guidebooks in the early 1980s for house builders on how to meet new thermal insulation regulations.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Measures by my Department to establish energy conservation in the home include the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  On behalf of my Department, the IIRS/EOLAS has for over a decade provided a free telephone advisory service for domestic energy consumers.</P>
    <P>(b)  An advertisement was placed by my Department in the national press in early 1991, with advice to the public on energy conservation measures in the home.</P>
    <P>(c)  In 1990 my Department established a Group on Electricity End-Use Efficiency, following an EC Decision in this area.  The ESB are represented on the Group.  The ESB's Action Programme for 1991 includes training of ESB staff on energy efficiency, a major media campaign promoting the <Col N="708" /> use of compact fluorescent lights and lagging jackets, an attic insulation service, and a mailshot to all domestic consumers about areas where customers can act to improve efficiency.  The ESB will also be involved in various exhibitions promoting energy efficiency.</P>
    <P>(d)  Since 1988 my Department have grant-aided on an annual basis the charitable group &ldquo;Energy Action&rdquo;, who are involved in draught-proofing the houses of the needy and elderly.</P>
    <P>(e)  EOLAS Regional Energy Officers are available to advise industry or members of the public on energy efficiency. This year they will be undertaking a series of talks to residents associations etc. on the subject.</P>

Indeed many substantial benefits in pay and other conditions have been secured under the scheme in the recent past, including two special pay increases totalling 16 per cent which are over and above the general pay increases.</P>

      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement setting out details of State road grants and EC grant assistance for public roads in each of the years 1985 to 1991.</P>
      <P>EC grant assistance for the improvement of these roads in the period 1985 to 1991 has been provided from the following three sources: The European Regional Development Fund; EC Transport Infrastructure Grants (EC Budget line 580); and FEOGA Western Package 1981 to 1991: local (county) roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tabular statement shows the amounts of the grant commitments for the ERDF and from EC Budget line 580 for road improvements in Ireland for <Col N="722" /> each of the years in question.  Payments on foot of these commitments are not made through my Department's Vote. The FEOGA grants for local roads were paid to my Department as an appropriation-in-aid; drawdown was completed in 1990.</P>
    <P>In addition to EC grant assistance, certain road projects qualify for loan finance from the European Investment Bank. The provision of details in this regard would be a matter for the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The tabular statement includes a breakdown of State road grants showing the amounts provided in respect of improvement and maintenance.  However it should be noted that the cost of maintenance does not qualify for EC assistance.  The State road grant figures in the statement for 1985 to 1990 are the amounts of grant paid in each of the years.  The 1991 figures for State road grants represent the allocations for the year.</P>
    <P>Following is the tabular statement:</P>

    <P>Allocations of £300,000 in 1991 and £100,000 in 1990 were made to the corporation in respect of the Abbeyquarter and St. John's Terrace remedial works schemes.  The apportionment of the allocation between these projects is a matter for the local authority.  In 1990, capital expenditure of £30,000 was incurred in respect of St. John's Terrace; the authority have not, to date, informed the Department of any such expenditure in the Abbeyquarter Estate.</P>

This information was sought as part of a review of long term road development needs.

    <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme which I introduced on 1 September 1990 <Col N="737" /> ensures that no person who is certified as having a long term medical condition with regular and ongoing requirements for prescribed medication, would have to pay more than £32 per month to the pharmacist. Persons, who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable to meet medical costs without undue hardship may be granted a medical card.</P>

      <P>Under a scheme approved by Government, grants are payable from the proceeds of the national lottery for the provision of local sports centres at various locations throughout the country subject to certain conditions which include the submission of satisfactory proposals on the facilities to be provided, a local contribution of 30 per cent of the construction costs and appropriate management arrangements to ensure that the centre operates on a self-financing basis.</P>
      <P>Wexford was designated as a location in 1989.  As no suitable proposals were received within the terms of the scheme despite correspondence with local interests, the offer of the grant has been withdrawn.  The reallocation of the grant in question is a matter for consideration in the light of the implementation of the sports capital programme as a whole.</P>

In October 1989 he was advised in accordance with standard procedures that if his attendance pattern did not improve the benefits of the sick pay scheme would be withdrawn from him.  A review of his case in March 1990 indicated that there was no improvement and accordingly the benefits of the sick pay scheme were withdrawn from him. He was therefore not entitled to pay in respect of periods of absence from that date including the period referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The medals awarded in relation to the periods in question are the 1916 Medal, the Service (1917-1921) Medal with Bar and the Service (1917-1921) Medal without Bar.</P>
      <P>An application for the posthumous award of the 1916 Medal in the case mentioned was made in 1986.  However, as it was not possible to establish that the person concerned rendered active service during Easter Week 1916, the application was refused.  Further action is not possible in the case.  If some further information is available which would confirm that the person mentioned rendered active service I will re-examine the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 229 and 230 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have today made an Order under section 45 of the Copyright Act, 1963, extending the provisions of that Act which relate to television and sound broadcasts made by RTE to the independent broadcasting services established under the Radio and Televisions Act, 1988.  A change of legislation is not necessary to achieve the objective in question.</P>
