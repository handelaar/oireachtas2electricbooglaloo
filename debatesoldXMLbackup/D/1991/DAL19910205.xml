      <Quest>if he will outline the findings of the investigation into the alleged leaking of Central Statistics Office inflation figures on 14 December 1990, and the consequent damage to this country's reputation internationally by the apparent use of the information by a number of dealers to make a speculative killing in deals on Government stocks; if it is intended to publish the report; if any new procedures are to be introduced to prevent further such leaks; if the Garda were asked to investigate the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As the House is aware, I ordered an immediate investigation, by the Director of the CSO and the Secretary of the Department of Finance, of allegations that the mid-November Consumer Price Index figures had been leaked in advance of publication.  The findings of their investigations have been published in a statement issued last Friday, 25 January, copies of which have <Col N="1430" /> been placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the Stock Exchange authorities informed the Secretary of the Department of Finance that there was no indication that any part of the market was particularly or unusually active on the day in question and that there was nothing which would allow them to conclude that there was evidence that advantage was taken of the information in question.  It must be concluded that no significant use, if any, was made of the information in question.</P>
      <P>I reject the suggestion that this country's reputation internationally has been damaged by this incident but Deputies who propagate that idea are themselves more likely to cause damage to our reputation.</P>
      <P>I did not consider that it would be possible for the Garda to add to the investigation already conducted.</P>
      <P>The premature disclosure of such sensitive official information is most regrettable. I have, therefore, taken action to prevent any possibility of its recurrence by having sensitive periodic economic statistics calculated and published in future only after the Stock Exchange has closed at 5 p.m.  This will mean that there cannot be a recurrence of the events of last December.  This new procedure will operate henceforth.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, in the context of the statement by his Chief Whip on 25 January to the effect that it was conceded that this information was available to some persons on the stock market as early as 2 p.m. on the day in question and to the market generally at 4 p.m., how can we reasonably be expected to believe that an organisation that functions on the basis of information would have made no use of that information? Is it not a fact, Sir, that the dogs in the street, especially the dogs in Anglesea Street, know that advantage was taken of it and in effect what we have here is a whitewash?  In his reply the Taoiseach relies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy has made his point, There is no need to elaborate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to confess to the House that I had a bet with my advisers that, no matter what report we brought out on his matter, it would be described by Deputy Pat Rabbitte as a whitewash and a cover up.  Today he has only used the &ldquo;whitewash&rdquo; one.</P>
      <P>I would like to give the Deputy some information about what happened on the Stock Exchange that day.  Perhaps it will help him to come to a conclusion about it.  The main factor influencing the gilt price on that day was the US bond prices that week.  Interest rates had been lowered the previous week in the US and there was an expectation that there would be a further reduction in interest rates that week.  US bond prices rose in the expectation of this further reduction but these hopes were dashed on Friday when retail sales and producer price figures published that day showed that the American economy was stronger than expected and a further reduction in interest rates was not warranted.  The rise in US bond prices that week, therefore, influenced the rise in our gilt prices which fell back on Friday when US bond prices fell.</P>
      <P>That is just a summary of the events as they have been described to me.  The general information and picture that has been painted for me is that the bond prices, gilt prices, that week were in fact influenced by international events and not by anything that happened here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the trading on the secondary market alone on the day in question reached £95 million, <Col N="1432" /> only £26 million of which was traded before this information became available? Will the Taoiseach tell the House to what extent his investigation relied on the Stock Exchange's own investigation? His reply and the reply of the Minister of State time and again refer to the Secretary of the Department having been advised by the Stock Exchange authorities. Finally, does the Taoiseach not agree that asking the Stock Exchange to investigate this kind of leak is like asking brothel keepers to investigate prostitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree because the Stock Exchange are the authority, the regulatory body.  The Secretary of the Department of Finance pursued with that organisation all the inquiries he felt it proper to make and he came to a conclusion on the basis of that information. It is not that the Secretary of the Department of Finance went to any one member of the Stock Exchange.  He went to the body, the regulatory authority and secured information from them.  We have no reason to suggest the Stock Exchange authority would attempt to conceal this information in any way.  It is just as much in their interests as in anybody else's to ensure that there are no practices on the Stock Exchange which would be dishonest or not in keeping with the highest standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that he, and the Government, are in an inherently weak position in this matter in view of that fact that they had to rely on a private body to investigate their members in a matter of this kind? Would he not agree that there is a need &mdash; and that this case highlights the need &mdash; for the State to acquire resources as the State, to investigate insider dealing or any other conflicts of this kind rather than have circumstances obtain in which those who are potentially involved are those who are investigating the alleged offences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Bruton knows that all over the world it is the <Col N="1433" /> regulatory body to which Government authorities go to seek information in these matters.  I understand the situation in all international financial markets is that the controlling body &mdash; whether it be the Stock Exchange or whoever else &mdash; are the body on which the public authority rely to ensure that practices are proper, correct and adhered to.  I do not know whether there is any additional mechanism we should establish.  I would like to point out to Deputy Bruton that fortunately incidents of this kind are very rare indeed on our Stock Exchange.  I do not know that we would be justified in going to the expense of setting up a whole new regulatory or investigative authority to investigate such happenings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be a very brief question.  The House will appreciate that we cannot remain unduly long on any one question.  Clearly that would be to the disadvantage of all other questions and Deputies interested therein.  I will call on Deputy Quinn and ask for brevity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that what concerns this House is the abuse to which insider information may have been put?  Can he indicate whether, in the course of the discussions his Department had with the Stock Exchange authorities, they were able to identify any clear beneficiaries of this premature leakage of information since all transactions are recorded?  Is he in a position to state whether such insider information was manifestly abused to the benefit of clearly identifiable people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the best information available to the Secretary of the Department of Finance, who carried out the investigation, the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  In fact I have a lot of other subsidiary information here about the sort of trading that took place that day all of which would seem to indicate that there was nothing particularly abnormal about it.  That nobody seemed to have used any private <Col N="1434" /> information of this kind.  By and large, movements on the Stock Exchange that day and on previous days &mdash; both on the main market and on what is called the secondary market &mdash; indicate in both these cases the bond market here was reacting to international events.  In fact on Friday the price of gilts fell on our Stock Exchange because of the change in the international situation.</P>
      <P>I will give the House the gist of that information if it would be helpful to Members.  Very largely this is the sort of information I have already given the House but I suppose the more information I give the House the better.  On foot of rising international markets the Irish Gilt Market began to rise on Wednesday, 12 December 1990.  For example, on the primary market, that is sales from the Exchequer to the market, the main stock being sold was 9¾ per cent Capital Stock, 1998.  The price of this stock on Wednesday, 12 December 1990 rose from 98.15 in the morning to close at 98.35.  It opened on Thursday, 13 December 1990 at 98.50 and rose progressively, in active selling, to close at 99.45, that was Thursday the day in question, up 95 pence on the day.  Dealing in the secondary market, that is investors dealing between themselves, broadly mirrored the rise in the primary market and continued to rise on Friday morning to a high of 99.75 on the 9¾ per cent Capital Stock, 1988, before falling back in line with a weakening in the international market. This pattern confirms that the market was influenced by international factors and moved in line with international trends. This is the normal pattern.  There is no evidence that other factors, such as price-sensitive information, had any impact on the market on 13-14 December 1990.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that, during the debate on Committee Stage of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987 Fine Gael Members put forward proposals which would have provided ministerial oversight of the self-regulatory activities of the Stock Exchange in regard to insider dealing?  Is <Col N="1435" /> the Taoiseach aware that these amendments were rejected by the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Would the Taoiseach agree to take up this matter with the Minister for Industry and Commerce with a view to ascertaining whether there should be some public interest oversight of the self-regulatory activities of the Stock Exchange in regard to their internal business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think we would be quite prepared to agree to look at that matter again though I would not like there to be any inference that we were not satisfied with the full bona fides of the Stock Exchange as a regulatory body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach whether, in respect of the statements that the investigation identified 33 civil servants who had possession of this information between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on the day in question, the investigation established how many politicians were in possession of the information?  Can the Taoiseach assure the House that the fears in financial circles that there are some favoured dealers on the Stock Exchange are unjustified and that that practice has been eliminated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, on the question of civil servants who had access to the information, it is quite clear from the fact that there were so many nobody was taking this information particularly seriously.  I, and my officials, were in Rome on the evening of Thursday, 13 December 1990 when we heard the figures at approximately 6 o'clock in the evening.  Our reaction was that this was very good news for our economy, for the people.  Not any one of us had the slightest thought that it might affect the financial markets in any way.  I think Deputy Rabbitte would agree with me that, up to that point, nobody in this House or anywhere else would ever have suspected that some of our public statistics &mdash; whether in regard to unemployment or whatever &mdash; would cause <Col N="1436" /> those people down there in their exotic realms to do one thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain that had I asked Deputy Rabbitte, before that Thursday, whether the publication of the CPI figures would influence the financial markets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I bet he would have said no.  My own best estimate on this is that if there was a disclosure &mdash; which apparently there was somewhere &mdash; it was inadvertent or accidental and that any sensible, reasonable person, looking at the overall position, would have come to that conclusion.</P>

      <P>It may be of interest to the House to note that in November last I sought information from the Taoiseach about the transfer of Presidential files and was told by you, Sir, that it was not a matter for his responsibility.  Now we find that these matters are the responsibility of the Taoiseach.  Can the Taoiseach say when the files were requisitioned by his Department and <Col N="1437" /> what section of the National Archives Act was invoked to requisition them because there appears to be some doubt as to whether his Department have the right to requisition Presidential files as distinct from Departmental files?  Can the Taoiseach indicate for how long the files were requisitioned and whether the Director of the National Archives made any arrangement for their alternative viewing by the public while in the possession of his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The power to sent for and retrieve them for inspection in the Department is a general power under the Archives Act.  This is traditional. There is nothing new or exceptional about this.  Figures given to me show that in 1990 as a whole my Department temporarily requisitioned files on 48 different topics.  These files dealt with the President's Office, the relationship of the President to the Government and to the Taoiseach's Office, and to precedents going back over a long time.  The simple explanation is that an official was newly assigned to this area because of the fact that we had an incoming President and a change of regime.  An additional official was assigned to the area who was not at all familiar with the situation, and to brief himself fully on all aspects of the job he sent for these files to peruse them in the normal way.  In 1990 alone files on 48 different types of topic were requisitioned by my Department and subsequently returned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that the section under which his Department would have the right to requisition files is section 8 (9) of the National Archives Act and that that refers specifically to archives which were formerly departmental records, and that it is not clear from the Taoiseach's reply that what was requisitioned here were in fact departmental records.  Could the Taoiseach clarify that point?  Will he agree that the reason there is concern or interest in these requisitions is the controversy that surrounded the question <Col N="1438" /> of Presidential files some months previously during the Presidential election?</P>

They are files which, over the years since the President's Office was established, deal with all the precedents, events and advice sought and given.  This power to withdraw files for perusal and send them back again has been exercised since the practice started in 1976.  There is nothing unusual about it.  The view of my Department and all the Departments is that they are entitled under that section and under the general provisions of the Archives Act to withdraw files temporarily and return them again.</P>

      <P>The National Heritage Council have the task of distributing national lottery funds to heritage projects, including archaeology.  The council have already allocated £176,850 to the post-excavation work resulting from these excavations and £70,000 had previously been allocated by my Department, also from national lottery funds.</P>
      <P>The question of whether additional grant assistance can be made available is entirely a matter for the council which have complete independence in deciding on the priorities for grant assistance and the amount, if any, in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably the Deputy's first question since he has returned to the Front Bench, so I will have to give it serious consideration.  The £70,000 was given by my Department directly, before we transferred that function to the National Heritage Council. The position now is that the Heritage Council deal with these matters and my Department do not deal with them directly.  There are other sources.  Waterford have done very well in this regard. These excavations are very important, very interesting excavations and because they are inner city urban type excavations <Col N="1441" /> they were treated much more favourably than normal.  I promise the Deputy that I will have a look at it and see where there are any other sources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach flattered to deceive.  I was hoping he was coming up with something but he passed it off to the National Heritage Council.  Will the Taoiseach use his good offices with that council?  I agree with what he said about the importance of the excavations: it is perhaps the most important Viking settlement in the country, including Wood Quay.  A sum of £1 million has been spent carrying out the excavations. Surely it is worth providing this £120,000 to document the findings of those excavations. Would the Taoiseach not agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that perhaps the most important aspect of these excavations is, apart from their intrinsic merit, that they are a good example for others to follow, because the urban authority and the developer have combined to maximise the archaeological value.  That is something we should encourage.  That was what influenced the exceptional level of grant already made. I do not approach the National Heritage Council about these matters because, as I have explained here frequently, I am very happy to leave those sort of artistic value judgments to the experts.  I am an expert on many things, but I like occasionally to hand it over to better recognised experts.</P>

Could he advise the House as to the reasons for the delay in the Department's recruiting any females into the Defence Forces?

In fact, 200 compares very favourably with the PDF, in which there are 90 women.  The Deputy will understand that it is not a simple exercise to get women into the FCA.  The nature of the FCA is that it is scattered throughout the country and we have to begin by recruiting in larger centres where facilities are available.

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to columns 646 and 647 of the Official Report containing my statement to the House on 18 January 1991, regarding the safety of Irish military personnel and their dependants in the Middle East.</P>
      <P>Nuclear, biological and chemical protective clothing, including respirators, has been issued to all members of the Permanent Defence Force serving with UNIFIL.  In addition one thousand chemical detector sets have been forwarded to the mission area.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to evacuate personnel from the mission area at present but an evacuation plan has been drawn up by UNIFIL headquarters as a contingency measure.  Evacuation arrangements would be administered by the United Nations.  In the interests of security, and as the contingency plan has been drawn up and would be implemented, should the need arise, by the United Nations, it would be inappropriate to disclose details of it.  Nationally owned equipment would be catered for in the evacuation plan.</P>
      <P>The operational situation in relation to all Irish personnel in the area continues to be closely monitored.</P>

      <P>Given that the question was prompted by somewhat unfortunate events that have developed since he last made a statement in the House to which he refers, namely, the shelling by Palestinians in South Lebanon of the Israeli installations, has the Taoiseach's monitoring borne those developments in mind and have the plans for any evacuation been updated, added to or improved?</P>

      <P>The International Committee of the Red Cross and the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have recently appealed to the Irish Red Cross Society for the provision of resources to assist in the Gulf War.

      <P>I would draw the Taoiseach's attention specifically to Question No. 15 which relates to a request for assistance either direct or indirect from the Defence Forces.  Is the Taoiseach suggesting to the House that there is remaining open in Government policy and attitude the possibility of deploying members of the Defence Forces in aid of any of the parties or combatants in the present troubles?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

May I ask the Taoiseach whether he or the Government intend to consult with the Irish Red Cross Society with a view to offering through them, or offering directly through the Defence Forces, the Government or whatever agency, humanitarian aid, for example by the deployment of personnel to man a field hospital in the area or are we leaving the matter entirely in the hands of the Red Cross?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, we are consulting with the Red Cross about the request.  There have been two requests to us, as I have already explained to the House: there is one request from the International Red Cross to the Irish Red Cross and there is another request from the UN Disaster Relief Fund.  Both these requests are under active consideration at the moment.  The Government are also considering carefully and watching developments to see if there is any other way in which this country can be of humanitarian assistance in this tragic situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it seems we are somewhat slow &mdash; perhaps the Taoiseach could advise us when the requests were made &mdash; in that many other European countries are already actively assisting on the ground? Would it not be a good signal from the Government and from this country if we were seen to be more quickly and more actively involved in the humanitarian area?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are already, of course, involved through the United Nations in looking after refugees, but as yet we have had no particular requests for additional assistance of any kind.  We have been carefully considering what sort of assistance we can give in a number of different areas, for instance the question of throwing our hospitals open for the receipt of the wounded from both sides. Questions like that are under constant examination and consideration by the Government.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the reason members of the Defence Forces who complete their terms of engagement and who take up employment within the public sector are not entitled to a gratuity, and are therefore no better off than a member who buys out of the Defence Forces prior to completion of their terms of engagement and who would not in any event be entitled to a gratuity; and if he will review the regulations concerned with a view to making gratuity payments to members who complete terms of engagement irrespective of subsequent employment.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any member of the Permanent Defence Force who is discharged on termination of his engagement is eligible for a gratuity under the Defence Forces (Pensions) schemes.</P>
      <P>Under the transfer of service scheme applicable to the public service, a person changing employment from one State organisation to another may have his or her pensionable service with the first organisation reckoned for superannuation purposes by the second.  This scheme was introduced so as to benefit employees by allowing mobility of service within participating State organisations.</P>
      <P>An underlying principle of the scheme is that service cannot be reckoned twice for superannuation purposes.  Accordingly, if a member of the Defence Forces opts to have his or her Army service reckoned for superannuation purposes by another public sector organisation, he or she foregoes payment of any gratuity payable in respect of that service.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no foundation whatsoever for the Deputy's suggestion that there is a shortage of personnel in the units of the Permanent Defence Force located in Border areas.  In fact, the number of personnel in these units increased in 1990 as a result of the recruiting which took place in that year.

That is certainly not the information I have on the ground and I reckon I am a little closer to it than the Taoiseach.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that even in the Tánaiste's own area there is a shortage of 70 men in the Cavan barracks.  I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider his reply to this question and get the comparative figures in the Border areas?

      <P>I must reiterate the facts as they are and of course, this is not on the basis of my personal observations or assessment but these are the facts supplied to me by the military Authorities. The truth of the matter is there is a slight increase in the number and there are more persons in the Permanent Defence Force serving in the Border areas at the end of 1990 than there were at the beginning of the year.  As the Deputy knows I cannot go into numbers or locations for security reasons but the confirmed military opinion is that the forces at their disposal are adequate.</P>

It is simple common sense.  In fact, as I have argued here before, it is an economy to have a suitable aircraft which can substitute for scheduled flying.</P>

      <P>In the 1991 crime fighting package announced by me on 10 December 1990, I indicated that the strength of the Garda Traffic Corps would be increased by 50 in 1991.  Members of the Force are now being selected and trained for Traffic Corps duties.  Prior to that announcement, the Garda authorities had already arranged for the assignment of 17 additional members of the force to the Dublin Metropolitan Area Traffic Corps.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the &ldquo;fine-on-the-spot&rdquo; system to cover additional offences is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, and is kept under review by his Department in consultation with my Department and the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that my question asked whether he had discussions with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, in relation to on-the-spot-fines?  Will the Minister agree that to talk about increasing the traffic corps by 50 in a country of our size where these officers are on 24 hour shift work is a joke?  Would he not agree that much time and effort could be saved by having our gardaí released from court duty if we had more on-the-spot fines and if a greater number were attached to the traffic corps?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at present 375 gardaí of all ranks up to Chief Superintendent employed on various aspects <Col N="1461" /> of traffic law enforcement duties.  The additional 50 I announced on 10 December will be added to that number.  There are in the force 10,600 gardaí whose responsibilities &mdash; as well as other areas &mdash; involves traffic law enforcement.  By the end of the year we will have 11,000 members within the force.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the very successful anti-drink driving campaign which involved all members of the Garda Síochána during the Christmas period. The Deputy can be assured that all resources that are requested are being made available in relation to traffic enforcement.  New equipment is being made available to the force and the situation is continually monitored.  So far as on-the-spot fines are concerned there is merit in what the Deputy said in relation to greater use of them.

      <P>Under section 70 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, the initiative regarding changes in telephone charges rests with Bord Telecom Éireann.  The same section provides that the company shall not increase any charge without my concurrence.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a Dáil Question on 30 January 1991, Telecom Éireann have submitted to my Department proposals for the construction of a more equitable, balanced charging system than exists at the moment and my Department are at present examining these proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister's reply relates to Question No. 21 and not to a later question.  Question No. 21 relates to the effects on our business internationally.  Is he aware that, according to a recent OECD report on a number of charges and different ways of approaching them, internal telephone charges here are 22 per cent higher than in Germany, 45 per cent higher than in the UK, 119 per cent higher than in Belgium and a colossal 226 per cent, over three times, the charges in the Netherlands and that the situation is almost similar in relation to international charges? <Col N="1463" /> Would he not accept that this adds a substantial charge to the costs for our businessmen who are trying to compete with member states in the European Community?  Finally, does he intend to place, at an early stage, a greater charge on telephone consumers because of the 2.5 per cent extra VAT charge announced in the budget?  Does he intend to instruct Telecom Éireann to carry those charges or will those additional charges be imposed on the consumers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that there is an unfortunate difference between ourselves and some of our competitors.  That is why Telecom Éireann have been striving over the last number of years not only to hold prices at their present level but actually to reduce them further.  That is why the Government, in association with Telecom Éireann, have put forward a programme which has resulted in an investment of £1.7 billion over the last number of years to make our telephone system the best in Europe, with perhaps the exception of France.  The Deputy will be delighted to hear that the new proposals from Telecom will mean reductions of approximately £37 million to telephone charges across the country &mdash; a reduction of 7 per cent &mdash; which will go to making us even more competitive in the period ahead.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister intend that the 2.5 per cent VAT charge announced in the budget will be passed on to the consumer?  Secondly, in relation to what the Minister said in regard to the reduction in prices by Telecom Éireann in recent years, is he aware that in the same period Belgian charges fell by 35 <Col N="1464" /> per cent, charges in Britain fell by 50 per cent and that in France, Germany and the Netherlands charges fell by an approximate 60 per cent?  Surely, with the advanced telephone technology and the greater number of telephones being used charges should have been reduced in line with our competitors?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 22 and Question No. 60 together.  I presume that Deputy Barrett's question refers to the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference held in Dublin on Thursday last and to the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that proceedings of the Anglo-Irish Conference are confidential and, in accordance with established practice, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on them <Col N="1465" /> beyond referring him to the joint statement issued after conference meetings. A copy of the joint statement issued after last Thursday's conference meeting has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>As to the question of amending legislation, I remain of the view that such a course should not be followed unless and until the need for amendment is established and would certainly be premature until the existing legislation in this area &mdash; the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987 &mdash; has been further tested before the courts.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Mr. Brooke did make a public statement saying he intended raising this matter with the Minister for Justice?  In view of that it is only right and proper that the public should be informed as to what steps the Minister intends taking.</P>
      <P>If the Minister needs any evidence as to why our extradition laws need to be amended he should refer to the case heard in the High Court last Friday week where two individuals were returned to Northern Ireland to face charges on the use of machine guns and where one of the people who was in possession of these arms was set free.  Does the Minister not agree that it makes an absolute joke of our extradition laws if people who store explosives, ammunition and weapons in Northern Ireland can, as fugitives, walk free because the offences they commit are regarded as political offences on this part of the island?  Does he not further agree that there is ample evidence to support the need for us to amend our existing laws?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already indicated in my reply, I would regard amending legislation at this stage as premature.  The 1987 Act has as yet only been judicially considered by the High Court in the course of two separate judgments, the judgment delivered by the President of the High Court in the Ellis case on 30 July 1990 and the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Lynch in the McGee, McKee and Sloan cases on 25 January this year. The Act has yet to be argued before or considered by the Supreme Court.  In those circumstances the Deputy must accept that the Act has in no sense been considered fully by the courts.  Can he, therefore, not accept that it would be premature to consider amending the Act now before it has been fully tested?</P>
      <P>I would also remind the Deputy that the outcome of the proceedings in which the 1987 Act has been considered to date by the High Court is that extradition orders have been confirmed in three out of four cases.  I would also remind the Deputy that the 1987 Act meets fully the obligations we assumed when we signed the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and accords fully with international norms in the limitations it places on the political offence exception for extradition purposes. Indeed, Ireland is only one of eight countries to have acceded to the convention without entering a reservation. The remaining 14 countries have entered reservations in relation to political offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> I want to assure the Deputy that we want to see this matter thoroughly clarified by the courts.  It would be premature to take any further action pending such clarification.  The Deputy asked if this matter was raised last Thursday and included in the joint statement issued after the meeting.</P>

This part of the report raises important issues concerning the respective functions, under the Constitution, of the Executive and the Judiciary and these require careful consideration.</P>
      <P>With regard to Part II of the report, the committee's recommendation that the questioning of suspects in Garda stations should take place before an audio-visual recording device, is being examined by my Department and the Garda authorities, with particular regard to the question of introducing this arrangement on a pilot basis in selected stations, as envisaged by the committee.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that it is regrettable and a poor reflection on his office that he has not yet reported progress on the implementation of the Martin Committee report when that committee responded speedily within six months to his request for a report? With regard to the establishment of an independent body of inquiry, as recommended by the committee, does the Minister not agree that the report made all the necessary recommendations on the establishment of such a body?  Secondly, in regard to the question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My priority is to get the right response to the recommendations rather than one which could have unforeseen consequences on public confidence in the court system.  I can assure the Deputy that the matter is under active consideration and that there will be no undue delay.</P>
      <P>In regard to the pilot scheme of questioning suspects in Garda stations before an audio-visual recording device, every pilot scheme has financial and staffing implications.  Other matters include the types of offences to be covered by video recordings, the amendment of judges rules, the possible need for regulations in relation to the storage of video tapes and the selection of Garda districts for the purposes of introducing such a pilot scheme.  All of these matters are being considered and I can assure the Deputy that action will be taken in the near future in relation to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice to make a statement on the attempts to firebomb major shops in the centre of Dublin, the threat of further firebombings, the action he has taken to deal with this situation and any further action he proposes to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday morning the gardaí at Store Street station were informed that two suspect devices had been found in a Dublin city centre shop.  On examination it was established by the Garda that these were incendiary devices.  They had not ignited but the Garda are satisfied that they were capable of doing so.  Following the discovery the Garda contacted the owners and managers of city centre premises with a view to ensuring that their premises were checked for similar devices.  None was found.</P>
      <P>Shortly after 5 p.m. yesterday the RUC informed the Garda that a telephone call had been received by the BBC from a person claiming to represent the Ulster Freedom Fighters.  The caller claimed that 15 to 20 incendiary devices had been planted in city centre shops in Dublin last Saturday.  All of the named locations were thoroughly searched by the Garda and staff of the premises last night but nothing was found.  However, I understand the searches of city centre premises by staff have continued today and that two further devices were found a short time ago at one of the named locations.</P>
      <P>I should like to assure the House that all the measures which are considered necessary to deal with this threat are being taken.  The Garda have, as a matter of course, regular consultations with the representatives of city centre business premises regarding security measures to deal with this type of incident and they are available to advise, as necessary, on such measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that devices were found, I would ask the owners and managers of all premises to which the public <Col N="1471" /> have access to be particularly vigilant.  I would also appeal for extra vigilance on the part of all members of the general public who should notify staff members if anything suspicious comes to notice in shops and elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, will he state whether there is a special Garda plan of action or co-ordinated response when such incidents occur, which would include, for example, the drafting of additional gardaí into the city centre area to deal with perhaps the parking of suspect vehicles, illegally parked cars and so on which might possibly pose a further threat as has been the case in Dublin in the past?

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is a very well co-ordinated, well organised plan of action which is put into operation when such threats are made.  It is, of course, vitally important that in any action that is taken we do not have to cause public alarm and concern with the implications that would have for centre city trading.  The Deputy can be assured that the Garda are very active in relation to any threat that is made.  They warn the general public, as they have done in this case, they warn the staff of the stores in the city centre area to be vigilant and they contact the management of the stores.  Every action that can be taken is being taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest, namely, the following: the crisis in the health services in a number of health board areas as a result of inadequate Government funding, the likely consequences in terms of longer waiting lists, the early discharge of patients, the longer holiday closure of beds and wards, the deferment of the filling of vacancies and a worsening in the plight of the mentally handicapped, with even less money for child care services and facilities for the elderly; the urgent need for the Government to review the allocation for all health boards in order to avoid health cuts and allow services to be restored to an acceptable level.

It states: that this House views with extreme concern the crisis facing the health boards and other health agencies arising from the allocations made by the Government and the Minister for Health, and condemns the failure of the Government to provide additional resources in the context of the budget.  In particular this House views with alarm the following: the fact that no health board will be able to meet their allocation for this year without further cutbacks in service, the fact that these cutbacks will inevitably mean the further closure of wards and beds in the course of the year, together with the suppression of medical and nursing posts that become vacant; the fact that the inevitable consequences of such cutbacks will be further delays in treating people on waiting lists, in addition to the already unacceptable delays; the fact that the Government are willing to promise a spurious extension of the right to free consultancy service without any negotiation or discussion with legitimate interests involved and without injecting the additional resources necessary to ensure that there is not a further deterioration in health services, the fact that the Government's allocation to community service this year will do nothing to repair the damage done to those services in the past three years; the fact that the Government have turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to the increasingly desperate need for residential accommodation for people with mental handicap, together with the growing need for training and sheltered employment; the fact that the Government have made a totally inadequate provision in the capital expenditure with the result that the new Tallaght hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It refers more directly to the question of setting up a committee on foreign affairs.  The Taoiseach informed the House just before the Christmas recess that he was going to have some discussions with the then Fine Gael spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, and subsequently informed the House that he was having further considerations.  At this stage can the Taoiseach say whether he intends setting up a committee on foreign affairs and whether he will have discussions with the Opposition spokespersons on foreign affairs or, indeed, with the Leaders of the Opposition parties?</P>

      <P>Before dealing with the substance of this motion, I should like to say some words on the unfounded rumours about an alleged reluctance of Deputy Flynn to move from his present posting as Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>The simple truth is that Deputy Padraig Flynn could not have refused to move because I never asked him to do so.  I have known the Minister for many years now, both personally and in Government, and can say unequivocally that these rumours do him a grave injustice.  Those who are, like me, familiar with him will know that he is a dedicated, loyal colleague in Government and would unhesitatingly place himself at the disposal of the Taoiseach in anything he might be asked to do.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I can understand that Deputies opposite would not understand that kind of honourable behaviour.  Let me add that, under the Constitution, I would be the person who would have to make any particular proposal for the removal or reassignment of a Minister.  Therefore, not unnaturally, I would be expected to know if any such proposal of that type existed.  No such proposal exists or has existed.</P>
      <P>I wish to state equally categorically that I have complete confidence in Deputy Bertie Ahern as the best Minister for Labour I have known.  There has been no question of his seeking a change of appointment nor has any such proposal been considered by me.</P>

      <P>Of course Deputy Daly will cease to be Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and at the Department of Finance on his appointment as a member of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I intend to recommend to Government that Deputy Vincent Brady be appointed as Minister of State at the <Col N="1576" /> Department of Finance in addition to his posts at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence.  He will have special responsibility for Heritage Affairs at the Department of the Taoiseach as Deputy Daly did, in addition to his responsibility as Government Chief Whip.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to continue and to greatly expand their major programme of law reform in accordance with the needs of a changing Irish society especially in the social and family law areas.  In order to assist the Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke, in this area and in the general work of the Department I propose to recommend to Government to appoint Deputy Noel Treacy, at present Minister of State at the Department of Health, as Minister of State at the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>With the same objective in mind, I also intend to recommend to Government that the Department of Communications, which is at present grouped with Justice under the Minister Deputy Ray Burke be merged with the Department of Tourism and transport, where I see the further major development which is required in our communications network and its rapidly advancing technology as being more directly related to the transport and tourist areas.  The new Department will be retitled the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications.</P>
    <P>In order to fill the vacancy in the Department of Health resulting from Deputy Treacy's move to Justice, I will propose that Deputy Chris Flood be appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Health.  I am sure the House would like to join with me in wishing him well in the discharge of his new responsibilities.</P>

      <P>I noted the warmth of the applause which I would say was somewhat tepid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it is appropriate to recall the circumstances in which this vacancy was <Col N="1577" /> created and which has lain unfilled for three months.  I think it is the longest period in the history of the State during which we have not had a full-time Minister for Defence.  It happened to have been a time in which defence could not have been or be more relevant to our concerns as a nation.  Yet, the position of Minister for Defence has lain unfilled for three long months.  Issues that needed immediate attention in the Defence Forces &mdash; particularly those arising from the important report of the Gleeson Commission &mdash; have remained not dealt with because of the Taoiseach's inability to take a decision as to who should fill the position of Minister for Defence.  The inability to take that decision can be traced back precisely to the circumstances in which the vacancy itself arose.  There is an inextricable link between the Taoiseach's inability to make up his mind about who should be Minister for Defence and the circumstances in which the vacancy in that office arose.  The circumstances in which that office became vacant, as the House well knows, were the dismissal of Deputy Brian Lenihan from that position by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>As we all know, Deputy Brian Lenihan is the man who over many years stood in the gap, the gap of danger sometimes, on behalf of the Taoiseach.  Whenever the Taoiseach, whether in his present capacity or simply in his capacity as leader of Fianna Fáil, got into trouble, the man to whom he turned for help, to go on radio, to go on TV and explain the inexplicable, was Deputy Brian Lenihan. This is not the time to argue this, but when Deputy Lenihan got into some difficulty, and there is no doubt that he was in very considerable difficulty, he found that the relationship was not mutual, that it was a one way track.  Loyalty flowed in one direction but not in the other.</P>
    <P>I recollect very well an occasion in 1973, one of the most memorable moments in my political life, when the first Coalition Government for 16 years were elected, and the President of Ireland, Mr. Eamon de Valera, invited all the members of the new Cabinet and <Col N="1578" /> some of the junior Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, to a meal. This is something which has been noted publicly.  The President spoke about the Coalition Government, and he was known to have views about coalition Governments, and the point he made, which was a very valid one, was that if we had a Coalition Government or a Government with different strands of opinion, there must above all be mutual loyalty.</P>
    <P>The bonds, the lines of loyalty within the Government who sit before me now have been irreparably broken by recent events.  I accept that this is not a concern of mine in a sense; the Fianna Fáil Party are not my party, and I am not particularly concerned about their welfare one way or the other.  In a sense they are a private organisation and their internal feuds are their own affair, if they are in Opposition, but this party are not in Opposition, they are in Government and their inability to look themselves straight in the face because of those events is having a corrosive effect on the conduct of public business at this time.  Decisions cannot be taken because Ministers are literally afraid of one another.  There was not any greater evidence of this fear, fear of ones colleagues, than the inability of the Taoiseach to make up his mind, to confront his colleagues and say, &ldquo;I have decided that Deputy X should be Minister for Defence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This internal paralysis in the Government has lead to four precise adverse consequences.  It has lead to the most unadventurous and indecisive budget in the history of the State in which tax reform has been completely abandoned. It has lead to the delay of three months to which I referred, in the filling of this vacancy.  It has lead to the unseemly and damaging spectacle of Ministers briefing the press vigorously against one another attempting to impugn colleague's motives in regard to alleged refusals to accept particular decisions in Cabinet from the Taoiseach.  It has lead to a situation in which it can be said of Fianna Fáil that they are a party very much like the <i>Ancien Regime</i> of Louis XVI.  Very <Col N="1579" /> little is it the case of careers open to talent.  Very much is it the case that one must stay in one's particular estate for the rest of one's life.  Once one is born to be a backbencher one must remain one in Fianna Fáil.  Once one happens to become a Minister, one will remain one indefinitely in Fianna Fáil under the Taoiseach. Fianna Fáil cannot in any way be described as a career open to talent. Backbenchers in Fianna Fáil will not feel any incentive to shine because quite clearly all those who now sit around the table have an irrevocable lease on the position they hold, because the Taoiseach is afraid to remove them.</P>
    <P>I listened to and read the Taoiseach's remarks with regard to what he described as the unfounded rumours about an alleged reluctance in Deputy Flynn to move from his present posting as Minister for the Environment.  I am reminded with regard to those remarks by the Taoiseach, of the assessment by Mandy Rice-Davies of statements by a Minister in the Government of Harold Macmillan, when she said &ldquo;he would say that, wouldn't he?&rdquo; Of course, the Taoiseach will deny these rumours.  He has no interest in admitting that these rumours are true.  Of course, he will say that Deputy Flynn made no such refusal.  I am not really concerned about whether he did or did not refuse although if he refused that involves an actual and immediate flouting of the authority of the Taoiseach.  Even if Deputy Flynn did not refuse, even if he was prepared to accept or if he was never asked, the fact is that the rumours about Deputy Flynn's refusal emanated from the Cabinet table, from his own colleagues who were the people who briefed the press to the effect that Deputy Flynn was refusing to move.  Why was that briefing done, whether or not it related to the truth?  It was done because the bonds of loyalty that should bind a collectively responsible Government have, in the case of Fianna Fáil, been irrevocably broken.  That is not simply a private matter.  It is a public matter because of the consequences for the conduct of public business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1580" /> What the Government needed at present, if they are to continue, was a radical reshuffle.  The Minister for Health is continuing in office apparently indefinitely and he cannot be moved because no one else will take the job even though he cannot do it.  As far as the health services are concerned the Minister, and the Government, are incapable of making any structural reform of the services, despite the fact that they have the Hederman report setting out what should be done.  They have set cash limits for the health boards which mean that those who bear the brunt of the health cuts are always the patients and never the administrators.  The Minister says that the making of the cuts is not a matter for him but a matter for the chief executives of the health boards.  In other words, he is abdicating responsibility for the health services as far as policy making is concerned and he simply sees himself as a post box for transmitting cash limits set by the Minister for Finance to health boards.  We might as well not have a Minister for Health in so far as health policy making is concerned.  Certainly, if that Minister is to continue in office he should have another post.</P>
    <P>It appears that we also have to put up with having the Minister for Agriculture and Food continue to represent our most substantial industry in Brussels.  Quite frankly, I was appalled to watch the Minister for Agriculture and Food on television the night before last, before the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers to discuss the proposals by Commissioner MacSharry which would turn rural Ireland ultimately into an Indian reservation with people being paid money to do nothing.  The proposals would involve a huge loss to the Irish economy and in PAYE jobs, those who depend for their living on either selling products to commercial agriculture or buying and processing the produce of commercial agriculture.  Yet the Minister on television could not tell the Irish people whether he was for or against the proposals made by Commissioner MacSharry. He was, to use the words of the television interviewer, non-commital.  A <Col N="1581" /> Minister for Agriculture and Food supposedly responsible for this industry who cannot make up his mind as to whether the MacSharry proposals are good or bad should not be a Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>In a personal sense I welcome the elevation of Deputy Brendan Daly.  He is undoubtedly a popular Deputy and well liked in this House, but it must not be forgotten that he is the Deputy who was responsible or was made responsible, I am not sure which, for the disastrous rod licence dispute, one of the most ill-advised political initiatives of the last decade.  Yet he is now to be restored to office to the very sensitive position of Minister for Defence where so many difficult decisions have to be made.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to other problems in the Government which have received quite an amount of press coverage. In my view the Progressive Democrats are contributing to this sense of paralysis in the Government.  Their very presence prevents Fianna Fáil from doing any business, but they are not able to do any business themselves.  They are using some well-tried public relations techniques in order to have the best of both worlds.  Their leader went on television to say that the budget was a good budget but in case any of the few remaining Progressive Democrats supporters believed that it was a bad budget the chairman of the party came along to say it was a bad budget.  Those who believe the budget was bad can find a Progressive Democrat to express their view and those who believe the budget was good can find a Progressive Democrat to express their view.  The Progressive Democrats are either unable to make up their own mind or they themselves are suffering from some of the disease that quite clearly has afflicted the major partner in Government. They seem to have the same sense of mutual incomprehension in their own party that exists also in the major party in Government.</P>
    <P>I believe this reshuffle &mdash; or perhaps &ldquo;scuffle&rdquo; would be a more appropriate word &mdash; which the House is being asked <Col N="1582" /> to approve indicates the existence of a chronic problem at the heart of the major party in Government, a chronic problem which will not go away and the only appropriate treatment for which is a sustained spell on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely grateful that the time for this debate has been extended from the original hour and a half offered by the Government to three hours, a request which was made by the Labour Party Whip.</P>
      <P>In her biography of the Duke of Wellington, Elizabeth Longford describes the entry of Napoleon into Paris this way:</P>
      <P>The Emperor was carried shoulder-high into the Tuileries on the 20th of March, 1815, with his eyes shut and a sleep-walker's smile on his face.  The Hundred Days had begun.</P>
      <P>The Hundred Days she referred to, of course, represented the period between Napoleon's triumphant return to Paris, after his escape from the island of Elba, and his ultimate defeat at the battle of Waterloo.  It was a glorious and exciting hundred days, which in many ways encapsulated the brilliance and also the fatal flaws which characterised Napoleon.</P>
      <P>Today we are coming to the end of another period of a hundred days, albeit a rather less glorious and exciting one. The hundred days we are celebrating today marks the period between Elba and Waterloo as well &mdash; but it was Deputy Brian Lenihan who was exiled to Elba a hundred days ago, and the Taoiseach who meets his Waterloo today, defeated as he is by the intransigence of one of his own Ministers, who refuses the transfer which in anybody's opinion he so richly deserves.</P>
      <P>The Emperor, surrounded by his marshals and foot soldiers, is carried shoulder high in here today, his eyes firmly shut to the division his Government have created in our society, to present us with a sleep- walker's reshuffle, characterised only by his dithering and lack of decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last hundred days we have seen squalid scandals of mature recollection <Col N="1583" /> here at home.  Internationally we have seen the world go to war.  We have seen some of the largest armies and biggest collections of firepower ever assembled inflicting massive destruction.  We have seen this Parliament participate in a charade over Ireland's position in relation to that war, and our Taoiseach has not been able to make up his mind about appointing a Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Surely there could be no greater comment on the pomposity and self-importance of this Government that while they have flown around Europe, posturing about our position in the world and in the European Community, we have been unable even to appoint a solitary Minister for Defence.  How or why we should be expected to be taken seriously, while this foolish agonising about a simple appointment was going on, defies any attempt at rationalisation.</P>
    <P>Of course, the last hundred days have seen the emergence of a new dimension in internal Cabinet relations as well.  Two high offices have been personified in one person and, as a result, whatever about other tensions in the Cabinet, at least we have been able to say that the relations between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence have been without any argument.</P>
    <P>Thus, the Minister for Defence has been able to supply 150 soldiers to guard the Taoiseach's own palace.  The Taoiseach has been able to silence any protest by the Minister for Defence at the relatively modest provision in the Estimates with which the Minister will be expected to meet the high expectations generated by his predecessor's promises to the members of the Defence Forces, promises made of course, while the predecessor was both Minister and a candidate for the office of Commander in Chief.  Of course, between them, they have been able to make any arrangements necessary to ensure that anyone interested in peaceful protest will not be able to get within a mile of Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>It must have been very soothing for the holders of these high offices to find so <Col N="1584" /> much common ground between them.  In fact, I began to suspect that the Taoiseach was giving consideration to holding on to Defence.  Think of the toys to be played with &mdash; the tanks to be lined up in the new palace, the helicopters to land and take off from the roof.  Think of all the times he would receive the crisp Army salute as he went about his rounds &mdash; quite a refreshing change that must make from the rather more abject and grovelling adoration he gets from his backbenchers, who are gradually departing.</P>
    <P>Instead, he has decided to re-instal Deputy Daly as Minister for Defence. On behalf of the Labour Party I wish Deputy Daly well in his appointment. If I describe his appointment and the proceedings today as a damp squib, it is for those reasons and not a personal reflection on Deputy Daly.  He is a decent Deputy who is well respected in this House and is popular.  He was dropped from Cabinet only because he was made the scapegoat of a disastrous collective Cabinet decision in relation to the rod licence issue.</P>
    <P>I would issue a word of warning to him, which I know he will take in the spirit in which it is intended.  He faces high expectations as Minister.  The provisions made in the Estimates under the headings of pay and allowances for the Defence Forces will not give him any room to manoeuvre.  He will need the strong support of his Taoiseach and other members of the Government in the months ahead. I think he knows enough to know by now that the strong support of the Taoiseach is reserved for only one man, and that is the Taoiseach himself.</P>
    <P>I described this appointment as a damp squib.  The reshuffle which we all expected, and which this Government need if they are to change the more reactionary elements of their image, has become a total anti-climax, because one Minister has refused to be moved.  We all know why &mdash; the Minister concerned is afraid that if he agrees to move it will prove that everything that &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo; says about him is true.  It must be the first time in history that a satirical <Col N="1585" /> radio programme has turned into self-fulfilling prophecy.</P>
    <P>Virtually every Minister who resigned from Mrs. Thatcher's Government in the dying days of her administration offered as his reason that he wanted to spend more time with his family.  I do not question the Taoiseach's statement that he did not ask the Minister for the Environment to move and, therefore, was not refused.  The point is that the Taoiseach's authority is totally diminished and he could not even ask for the move he wanted.  In the case of the Minister for the Environment, it would perhaps be difficult for him to offer the reason offered by Ministers across the water.  We have all found out in recent months that he is an acknowledged expert on the family and on parenthood.  There is no need then for him to be changed from his present position.  This expert on the family will continue for the time being to preside over the re-emergence of a housing crisis, the kind of crisis which places intolerable strains on families waiting for housing throughout the country.  He will continue to preside over the decimation of local authorities and the essential services they provide.  He will continue to do so because he decrees that he will, not because the Taoiseach, his party leader, wishes it.</P>
    <P>Because the Flynnstone factor has prevailed in determining the nature and the scope of this reshuffle, the Minister for Health is also to remain at his post, presiding over a health service he is privately prepared to admit is in more serious difficulties than at any time since he came into office.  His management of the health services has been an unmitigated disaster from the beginning.  The most serious criticism I can offer of him is that, single handed he has removed any concept of a right to the provision of health care.</P>
    <P>Three years ago we had a health service which was struggling with financial difficulties, but one in which access to care was determined by medical criteria. Now access to health care when it is needed is determined almost entirely by income.  That is the fundamental change brought about by the policies of this Minister, <Col N="1586" /> and by his failure to fight for the rights of the people he was elected to serve.  If anyone should see himself as the champion and advocate of the sick and the handicapped, it is the Minister for Health.  This Minister has never done so, and he should have been offered a free transfer years ago.</P>
    <P>The same is true of the Minister for Education, who has substituted bluster and sleight-of-hand for policy in the last three years.  We have all seen the promises of reductions in the pupil teacher ratio in the last few weeks.  What should not be forgotten is that even if those promises are kept, the pupil teacher ratio will still be greater than when this Minister came into office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect that her promises will have on average class sizes &mdash; a measure of progress in education that is never mentioned nowadays &mdash; will be negligible.</P>
      <P>The only other significant change announced by the Taoiseach is the removal from the Minister Deputy Burke of the communications portfolio &mdash; which has been sought by this House for a long time and its transfer to the Minister Deputy Brennan, the man who is making a bid at this stage to be the Pooh-Bah of this Government, the Minister for everything else.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke's principal job in communications, is done, of course.  He has brow-beaten RTE into submission and starved them of the resources necessary to provide an effective public service that is never beholden to the establishment of the day.  He has forced them to hand over Cablelink in the least advantageous way possible, and has, in the process, helped to fatten up Telecom for eventual privatisation. He is now free to concentrate on the files in the Department of Justice, and I must express the hope that they, at least, do not keep him awake at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister Deputy Brennan, on the other hand, is now in charge of three areas of responsibility, in fact, everything else that is left in Government.  He has now three major areas of responsibility <Col N="1587" /> and six semi-State bodies.  We can now expect the Minister Deputy Brennan to become the chief privatiser of this Government.  He has so far made no other impact on the life of the nation, except through his rather odd approach to supporting failed private enterprises by forcing successful semi-State companies to subsidise them.  He can rest assured that his every move in his new Department will be carefully watched, to ensure that it is driven by commercial good sense rather than ideological whimsy which we have seen in the past.</P>
    <P>All in all, the Government remain intact.  This is the same Government who preside over the highest exodus of people from our country in any decade in the last five.  This is the same Government who are presiding over a rapidly increasing rate of unemployment, and attempting to ignore the problem in the hope that it will go away.  This is the same Government who are trying to hide away from the reality of a rapidly expanding set of social problems.  This is the same Government who are trying to be all things to all men on the international front, and have ended up by failing to offer any position at all on behalf of Ireland.  This is not a Government who need a reshuffle &mdash; they need a fundamental reappraisal of their very existence.</P>
    <P>We have already indicated that it is our intention to vote against this appointment. I should say again that we are not voting against the appointment of Deputy Daly as Minister for Defence. We certainly wish him well both personally and politically because he is facing a very difficult assignment given the very tight budget that has been left to him by his predecessor.  Our vote will be cast directly against the Taoiseach who appointed him; who has reduced the office of Minister for Defence to a joke in the last three months; who has failed in his first constitutional duty to be the head of Government; and who has run away from the imperative need to fundamentally change both the personnel and the policies that have divided our <Col N="1588" /> society so drastically since he became Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has at last &mdash; after more than three months &mdash; got around to appointing an additional member to the Cabinet to fill the Office of Minister for Defence, but I cannot offer a similar welcome for the appointment itself.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Taoiseach to leave the Department of Defence without a full time Minister for more than three months is inexplicable and unforgiveable and has done enormous damage to morale both within the Department and within the Defence Forces.  It has meant that this important Department has been without a full time Minister at a time when there is a major conflict going on in the Gulf and when Irish soldiers serving with UNIFIL face increased dangers.  It left the Department of Defence without a full time Minister at a time when the reform process and the implementation of the Gleeson report had reached a crucial point.  I understand, in fact, that the implementation of the Gleeson report has ground to a virtual halt and that it is going to be difficult to get the process off the ground again.</P>
      <P>Whatever one might think about the manner in which he performed during the Presidential election and the circumstances of his dismissal by the Taoiseach, it would be churlish not to acknowledge that Deputy Brian Lenihan was one of the most competent and successful Ministers for Defence in recent times.  He took office in 1989 at a point when morale in the Defence Forces was at an all time low, when there was seething discontent over pay and conditions, when Defence Forces personnel were still denied the right to join a representative body, and when there was a real danger of very serious conflict between the Department and the enlisted personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan faced an enormous challenge in restoring morale and winning back the confidence of the personnel. Broadly speaking he was successful in doing so.  He gave certain undertakings and he honoured them.  The <Col N="1589" /> Defence (Amendment) Act, while by no means perfect, was an important advance.  It allowed for the establishment of the representative bodies, which was probably the most important step forward in regard to the democratic rights of Defence Forces personnel since the establishment of the State.  Pay and conditions have improved, slightly perhaps, but they have improved though much remains to be done.  There was a serious effort made to implement the root and branch reforms advocated in the Gleeson report.  I very much fear that this is now all in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems within the Defence Forces have had their origins in the fact that more often than not defence was the preserve of second division Ministers. I do not wish to be personally offensive to Deputy Daly, but I know that his appointment will not inspire confidence among the Defence Forces.  His only notable political legacy so far was the appallingly divisive rod-angling licence dispute, which did enormous damage to the tourist industry in certain areas and in regard to which the Government are still trying to pick up the pieces. I do not believe that Deputy Daly has the experience or the political clout to ensure that the Defence Forces get the attention they deserve at the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>It is very obvious also that the Taoiseach's plans for a more widespread reallocation of Cabinet positions has been successfully frustrated by a rebellion by one of his senior Cabinet Ministers.  The Taoiseach's denial last week, and again today, that any such reshuffle had been contemplated was unconvincing and quite at variance with what his own Ministers and Deputies were saying openly around Leinster House last week.  The cracks not just in the Coalition, but within Fianna Fáil itself, grow wider every day.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, has plainly defied the authority of the Taoiseach by refusing to move to another Department.  Such a successful rebellion can only undermine <Col N="1590" /> the political credibility of the Taoiseach and further destabilise this Government.</P>

      <P>This event must be compared with the refusal in 1986 of the then Labour Party Minister, Deputy Barry Desmond, to leave the Department of Health, a move which gravely damaged the political authority of Dr. Garret FitzGerald at that time and, indeed, in many respects marked the beginning of the end of the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition of those years.  It must be said that if, as Deputy Flynn has stated, he did not refuse, nevertheless there are strong indications that the Taoiseach did want to reshuffle this Government.</P>

      <P>I can assure you Chairman I am not inviting interruptions. I am making my contribution to this debate.  I allowed the Deputies opposite to make their contributions in order to <Col N="1591" /> have on record what they believe to be the truth.</P>
      <P>I want to make the point that we will be voting against this motion, not simply because we have no confidence in the appointment announced today by the Taoiseach, indeed not just the one appointment but all of the appointments, but because we have no confidence in the Government in general.  The Workers' Party have a motion of no confidence in the Government on the Order Paper going back to October last and nothing we have seen since then would lead to a restoration of confidence in this Government. Indeed, with every day their shortcomings become more evident.  We have just seen unemployment jump to its highest level in two years and yet the Government produced a budget which included not one single measure likely to create an additional job or stimulate any new employment.</P>
      <P>Despite the promises contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to provide a comprehensive equitable and efficient healthcare system, health services throughout the country face a major crisis unless the Government immediately provide additional funds for the health boards.  The fact is that the health services have never recovered from the severe cutbacks imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 and 1988 and still require significant additional funding even to allow services to be restored to the levels operating in the mid-eighties.  The current shortfall facing several health boards will mean even longer waiting lists; the early discharge of patients; the longer closure of wards and beds during holiday periods; a worsening of the plight of the mentally handicapped and less money for child care services and facilities for the elderly. Their appalling record in the health area alone would be sufficient grounds for booting this Government out of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate when discussing the appointment of a new Minister for Defence that we should refer to the appalling slaughter and the physical and ecological destruction in the Gulf War. <Col N="1592" /> There is an urgent need for a fresh debate in this House on that war, in view of the developments since it was launched by the United States and its allies, and their now declared intention of going beyond the mandate of Resolution 660 of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>Last week at Question Time the Taoiseach finally admitted that he believed sanctions had not been given sufficient time to work.  This is an astonishing admission by a Government who are actively assisting in the prosecution of this war by providing refuelling facilities at Shannon and overflight facilities for aircraft of those countries engaged in this war.  The logic of this view, as I have argued repeatedly, is that this war is unnecessary and was avoidable. What is necessary is for Ireland to use every avenue open to it to actively seek a ceasefire and to insist on the United Nations regaining control of the situation.  In pursuing such a course, we should logically refuse to provide refuelling or overflight facilities to the belligerents in this grab for control of Middle East oil.  We should specifically take into account that Britain has allowed landing to B-52 bombers in Britain and, if we have not received it already, it is quite likely that requests will be made to us for overflight facilities through Irish air space.  It should be borne in mind that B-52 bombers are used for indiscriminate carpet bombing and under no circumstances should we allow such aircraft to pass through our air space.</P>
    <P>I want to comment also on the other changes announced by the Taoiseach.  I welcome the decision of the Taoiseach to withdraw the Communications portfolio from the Minister, Deputy Burke.  We have always held it was a mistake to combine the portfolios of Justice and Communications.  Indeed, the demands of the Department of Justice are more than sufficient for any one Minister. However, it should be noted that we are not just seeing responsibility for the Department of Communications being given to a new Minister but what we are seeing is the virtual abolition of the Department of Communications and it is <Col N="1593" /> important that that be borne in mind.  I am deeply concerned, however, at the decision to give responsibility for communication matters to Deputy Brennan, in view of his attitude to RTE, which will now be one of his main areas of responsibility.  Deputies will no doubt recall the attempts of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, in September 1989 to bully and intimidate RTE because on a current affairs programme he was asked a legitimate question regarding financial contributions to his party, which he found embarrassing and was unwilling to answer.  The fear must now be that the Minister, Deputy Brennan, having established his ability &ldquo;to put the boot in&rdquo; is being given RTE to sort out and to silence all critical comments or difficult questions for this Government.</P>
    <P>I indicated at the beginning that my party will be voting against the motion to appoint the new Minister and I urge the House generally to do so also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The moving of this motion by the Taoiseach this evening is somewhat ironic and throws into relief the attitude shown by him at Question Time this afternoon when as the Minister for Defence he was answering the questions tabled to him on the arrangements to be put in place by the Department with regard to the promotion of senior officers in the future. The Taoiseach for some reason seemed to lose his temper and suggested that matters with regard to the running of the Defence Forces would not be taken on by any Member of this House and that it should be left to those within the Defence Forces and its leadership.  He now, of necessity, brings before the House a motion to appoint a full-time Minister for Defence to those very same Defence Forces.  We have the opportunity in this House to comment on that item as the Taoiseach must seek the permission and approval of this House for this appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to be welcomed at least that the primacy of this House with regard to matters not only in regard to the Department of Defence but with regard to the <Col N="1594" /> appointment of any Government Minister is underwritten in the Constitution and that it is a function and responsibility of this House to be involved in the appointments to the highest office in any Department and in particular to the Department of Defence.  These appointments must have the consent of the Members of this House.  In some respects the moving of this motion is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it must also be noted that this has come much too late in the day. The Taoiseach has not yet explained in moving his motion why it took almost 100 days from the time he sacked ignominiously his long-time friend and colleague as he then described him, the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Brian Lenihan to find a replacement and to appoint in the way he has Deputy Daly to the position.  First, it must be recognised that morale in any area of the State &mdash; but most importantly in the area of Defence and the courageous work that the members of the Defence Force do in defending democracy and the institutions of this State &mdash; is important and it is important that it is understood, respected and maintained.  The Taoiseach has delivered a very serious blow to that morale by his failure to appoint a full-time Minister. Second, the very important momentum which had been established in the Defence Forces in the earlier months of 1990 was lost entirely over the past three months.  The Gleeson report which was published in the middle of last year had been taken on board very quickly by the then Minister of Defence, Deputy Lenihan, who indicated at the early stages of the new term last October that many of the crucial and key decisions and recommendations of that report had been taken on board by him as Minister and would be implemented.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Taoiseach, because of all the responsibilities he had taken on board and intended to look after over the Christmas period, had not the opportunity to deal with them, or maintain the momentum that was there previously. Issues regarding the establishment of associations of the Defence Forces have <Col N="1595" /> been left unattended.  Very important matters regarding the provision of resources, of offices, of staff and of means whereby they could establish an independent existence promised in this House by the former Tánaiste and Minister for Defence during the debate on the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990, have not been carried forward or implemented as we were led to believe they would be. The establishment of those associations independent of the chain of command, which would work with their own secretariat exterior to the Defence Forces structures, has not taken place and has led to massive resentment and frustration within the Defence Forces not only at the recruit NCO level but even among the higher rank associations who are now wondering whether this whole process is to be put in place or whether the matter is to be lost entirely.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of this House if it did not note the important contribution that Deputy Lenihan made during his term as Minister for Defence.  It is fair to say that this Ministry &mdash; if one can draw parallels &mdash; is not considered to be a major portfolio of responsibility.  It is clear that Deputy Lenihan, who was suffering from ill-health at the time and recovering in a remarkable way from a major operation, took on this Ministry as one that seemed to be within his capabilities. Having done so, the energy and innovation with which he introduced change and debate within the Defence Forces in the short few months he was in that Department was remarkable for the lack lustre history of that Department on the one hand and his own limitations &mdash; personal and otherwise &mdash; on the other.</P>
    <P>The momentum was remarkable.  The change and debate which was introduced was historic in many respects.  While his departure was a matter for the Taoiseach &mdash; the way it happened was a matter for him and his own survival &mdash; we on this side of the House regret that what was started was not passed on quickly to a successor.  Much of that momentum has been lost and morale in the Defence Forces has been dealt a very serious and <Col N="1596" /> sad blow.  I hope the new Minister in that Department, Deputy Daly, can pick up the pieces if they are there to be taken up.  To the extent that he may have the job shortly, depending on the views of the House, I wish him well in his work.  I cannot do otherwise.  Deputy De Rossa has indicated some of our reservations given his previous performance as Minister for the Marine and the unfortunate debacle of the rod licence.  Our hope is that lessons were learned then and that mistakes of hasty, ill-considered decisions will not be repeated because there is so much important and vital work to be done in Defence over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Gleeson report has, it seems, been forgotten.  Certainly any view abroad that pay and conditions for the Defence Forces have improved remarkably, despite its publication, leaves much to be understood as to what has to be done in that Department.  Deputy Daly will have shortly a very serious duty to ensure that the recommendations of the committees and of the Gleeson report will be implemented without any demur on his part or on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>The second issue of importance that arises as a consequence of the Government's motion is the Taoiseach's attempt to address the haphazard and poor performance of the Minister for Justice and Communications.  Two things have happened today.  First, the portfolio of Communications has at last been taken from the Minister Deputy Burke and passed on to the Minister Deputy Brennan. Second, a Minister of State has been appointed to the Department of Justice. Both of these demands were made by myself, as spokesperson on Justice, and by others on this side of the House over the last number of years, in fact, almost from the day Deputy Burke was appointed to both portfolios.  No reasoned explanation was given then and no justification has been given since.</P>
    <P>The appointment of Deputy Séamus Brennan to the portfolio of Communications is a matter of concern. Deputy Burke developed the name of &ldquo;Rambo&rdquo; in the way he dealt with the <Col N="1597" /> Broadcasting Bill.  He developed a macho image of a man who would brook no criticism, no interference and would listen to no views whatever once he had set about the task of tackling RTE and dealing with them in the way that Fianna Fáil had so long promised.  I cannot say that the physique of Deputy Séamus Brennan would suggest that at the end of his term he may end up being called &ldquo;Rambo&rdquo; in the same way as Deputy Burke.  However, there is no doubt that the same vengeance and vendetta exists in the personage of Deputy Séamus Brennan towards RTE as a public broadcasting authority.</P>
    <P>No one can forget, as Deputy De Rossa and others here said, the manner in which he pursued with a vengeance, single handedly, a reporter who did no more than put to him a searing searching question he was unable to handle at the time and how he then demanded and sought an apology.  The message was delivered by more senior members of the Cabinet, but nonetheless the man who could have called a halt to that ignominious process was Deputy Séamus Brennan.  The way the reporter was forced to issue a letter of apology to the Minister bodes ill in regard to the notion that Deputy Séamus Brennan might have about the independence of reporters in their functions and duties and about a Minister not using his office to set a score aright when he or she has been found wanting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that a Minister of State has been appointed to the Department of Justice.  Deputy Treacy, who has been appointed, has shown in his handling of the Child Care Bill that he has an aptitude to deal with complex legislation, that he has some notion of the rights of children, an important area in which Deputy Burke has shown little interest.  He has failed to provide the institution of detention he promised for young female offenders; he has failed to introduce any mark of responsibility in regard to child rights <Col N="1598" /> generally in his Department.  Children of seven years are still to be considered criminals within our code and he has failed to look at that issue.</P>
      <P>Finally, I welcome the appointment of Deputy Chris Flood to the position of Minister of State.  I wish him well in his work.  I hope his appointment will ensure that the building of the regional hospital at Tallaght will proceed, that Beaumont Hospital in my own constituency will be brought to full potential and that the closed wards will soon be opened.  The Taoiseach, in whose constituency it is located, appears unable to do so.  I hope the services in the Dublin area generally will improve by the appointment of a Minister of State from the Dublin region and, in particular, services for the mentally handicapped.  I hope that is not just a pious aspiration on my part.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to congratulate my colleague and neighbour, Deputy Brendan Daly, on his nomination as Minister for Defence.  It is opportune that he should be appointed Minister for Defence and I am glad the Taoiseach has seen fit to reappoint him to the Cabinet.  If I were to criticise the Taoiseach it would be for removing Deputy Brendan Daly from the Cabinet in 1989 because of the debacle of the rod licence and a coalition arrangement with the Progressive Democrats.  It was unacceptable to many of us that County Clare should have been victimised in that way and I am glad Deputy Daly has been <Col N="1599" /> nominated for reappointment to the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the Taoiseach has been operating in a paralytic state for the past three months.  Today we have been given a slight indication that that paralysis is leaving his left hand when he lifted one finger and nominated Deputy Brendan Daly as Minister for Defence.  However, he found it very difficult to get any further movement into his arm and shake up the Cabinet.  Contrary to all our expectations and the hype over the past six months and longer about a major Cabinet reshuffle, we have witnessed today only the minimum of Cabinet reshuffles.  One has to question why there has been such a minimal Cabinet reshuffle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Minister of State that it is because the Taoiseach is afraid for his political life and of what might hit him in the back from within his own party.  That is the bottom line on what has happened in this House today, and the Minister of State is well aware of that.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has nominated the appointment of only one new Minister. There has been no reshuffle as such, only the transfer of responsibility for Communications from the Minister Deputy Burke to the Minister Deputy Brennan, new responsibilities being given to two junior Ministers and the appointment of a new Minister of State.  In effect, what has happened today is a nonevent for the Government and is an indication of the Taoiseach's lack of courage to introduce change.  It is a pity that the Taoiseach who in the past was regarded as a fearless man can now be seen to be a fearful man.  We have witnessed evidence of this in the House today in his Cabinet reshuffle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Flood on his nomination as Minister of State at the Department of Health.  I understand Deputy Flood is a very active member of Dublin County Council. <Col N="1600" /> There has been a particular problem in Dublin in regard to the housing of itinerants and the opposition of the settled community to this proposal.  I hope Deputy Flood will use his new office to help resolve the problems in regard to the travelling community in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not refer in this debate to the previous Minister for Defence, Deputy Brian Lenihan. Since I became spokesperson on Defence for Fine Gael some weeks ago I have been made aware of the high esteem in which Deputy Lenihan was held as Minister for Defence by members of the Defence Forces.  He did a lot of good work during his short term as Minister for Defence and took action in many areas where there had been no action previously.  It is unfortunate that a man with his record in public life is no longer a Government Minister.  The story of his dismissal will go down in political history and in the history of Fianna Fáil.  It is not a very pleasant story and I do not wish to go over the events which led to his dismissal.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence will have a particular problem to deal with in the current political climate.  There has been a war in the Gulf for the past two and a half weeks.  Yet, the Taoiseach did not see fit to appoint a Minister for Defence before now.  I hope this is not indicative of his attitude to defence matters.  As one of two Members of this House who was an officer in the FCA, I hope he will indicate to the new Minister for Defence the special importance which must be given to the position of the FCA.  The FCA has been allowed to deteriorate over the years.  The accommodation provided for members of the FCA is appalling. Some of the offices occupied by FCA personnel at present would have to be seen to be believed.  The floors in many of these offices are full of holes and the roofs are falling in.  In addition, the training given to FCA personnel is almost nil. The maximum which can be given is one week a year.  The conditions in which FCA personnel have to live, the quality of their clothing and the food they have <Col N="1601" /> to eat are appalling.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence to pay particular attention to this issue.  They should keep in mind that while they are not recruiting people into the FCA, subversive organisations such as the IRA are readily recruiting young people.</P>
    <P>Some people tend to laugh at the FCA and regard it as a source of amusement. It is extremely unfortunate that this is so. At one stage people were honoured to serve their country.  A sense of service and commitment to one's country was something to be proud of and not something to be sneered or sniggered at. However, I believe that because of the attitude of this Government and previous Governments to this issue people's attitudes changed.  There will be an onus on the new Minister for Defence to instil a sense of pride in young people by encouraging them to get involved in the FCA. Not alone should young men be recruited into the FCA but so should young women.  There should be open recruitment for all young people.</P>
    <P>We take the Army and the FCA for granted because we do not believe they have very much to do.  We regard them as an insurance policy which has to be there and it is not until they are called on to deal with a certain problem that we recognise their importance.  Prior to 1969 people's attitude to the Army left much to be desired.  However, the importance of the Army was recognised in 1969 when it became evident that there was need for Army personnel to be located along the Border.  People began to view the Army in a new light after that.  They also began to view the FCA in a new light when they had to become involved in Army activities due to the transfer of Army personnel to the Border.  Indeed, in some instances the FCA were involved in Army activities along the Border and in other areas around the country.</P>
    <P>This issue must be given serious consideration. The Government must make a proper financial commitment to the development of the Army so that they will have proper facilities and working conditions and receive adequate pay.  The pay and working conditions of the Army <Col N="1602" /> deteriorated during the period 1973 to 1988.  An Army commandant who was three points ahead of a Garda superintendent in 1973 was 28 points behind a Garda superintendent by 1988-89.  This anomaly must be corrected immediately.</P>
    <P>Over the years the Army have done us proud as a serving member of the United Nations peace-keeping force in the Congo, Lebanon, Israel, the Gaza Strip and at present in south Lebanon and in the Iran-Iraq area where some of the personnel are involved in a supervisory capacity.  One senior Irish Army official, Bill O'Callaghan, did Ireland proud in his role with the United Nations three or four years ago.  It is important that we are aware of the commitment of the Army personnel to peace-keeping, both nationally and internationally.  At present our troops in the Lebanon must be commended on the way they are carrying out their duties in difficult circumstances and their families deserve greater support from the Department of Defence.  The new Minister has an opportunity to arrange better communication between the troops serving abroad and their families at home in present circumstances.  I would ask him to have that matter investigated as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am pleased Deputy Daly has been nominated again to the Cabinet.  He will have a lot of responsibility as Minister for Defence.  It is a sensitive area and one that demands a lot of skill and attention. I would ask him to pay particular attention to the Army jumping team which has brought us international renown.  They have done tremendous work promoting the horse industry in Ireland, and they can be used to further promote that industry particularly at a time when the horse population is declining.  I would ask the Minister to view the matter in that light.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every good luck.  I hope that when his term as Minister for Defence ends it will not be in the same circumstances as when he was Minister for the Marine.  I hope the Taoiseach will view this matter in a more positive light than the situation that existed in 1989. There are difficulties in the Defence <Col N="1603" /> Forces which need urgent attention, particularly in relation to pay and conditions, and I would ask the Minister to immediately address those matters.  I would ask the Taoiseach to ensure that the Department of Defence within the overall Cabinet structure, are not treated as a Cinderella Department but that he will give them priority at the Cabinet table from the point of view of making positive financial commitments.  There should be a very clear line where our Army and the reserve forces will stand in the future.</P>

      <P>I would take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Brendan Daly, on his nomination by the Taoiseach.  In the likely event of his nomination being approved by this House later this evening I assure him that I will be a vigorous and constructive opponent as Labour spokesman on Defence in the interests of the personnel of the Defence Forces.  I also congratulate Deputy Chris Flood on his nomination as Minister of State at the Department of Health.  I have worked with him for a considerable period on Dublin County Council.  He is a very active and committed public representative.</P>
      <P>Last week the Labour Party raised the whole issue of the Government commitment to the future construction of the Tallaght Regional Hospital.  As other speakers have said this afternoon, hopefully that commitment will be met and I hope the new Minister of State will use his position to ensure that the project goes ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who has had dealings with the previous Tánaiste and Minister for Defence, Deputy Brian Lenihan, I would like to thank him for his commitment to the establishment of the representative association for the Defence Forces, a commitment which is acknowledged by the personnel of the Defence Forces.  In November when Deputy Lenihan last answered questions as Minister for Defence he gave certain commitments, <Col N="1604" /> and I will be ensuring that the new Minister will meet those commitments.</P>
    <P>The non-appointment of a full-time Minister for Defence since October last has been a tragedy for the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces personnel. That was a very important period during which the Department's Estimates were prepared, published and passed.  The absence of a full-time Minister is very evident in those Estimates and, indeed, in the budget brought before us last week.</P>
    <P>In July 1990 the report of the Gleeson Commission, the first independent commission to examine the conditions of service and rates of pay in the Defence Forces, was published.  There were 170 recommendations in that report which was generally welcomed.  There were great hopes that these recommendations would be accepted by the Government and implemented in full.  This would require a commitment by Government to provide money for that purpose.  I know that all the recommendations could not be implemented in the one year, but I regret very much that, with the exception of salary increases none of the recommendations has been implemented, and it is very evident from the Book of Estimates and from the budget that there will be no real movement during 1991 towards implementing them.  My great fear is that this report will be assigned to a shelf in the Department, like many a report before it.  If that happens it will be a disgrace and it is something that we, as representatives should not allow to happen.</P>
    <P>The commission visited various barracks throughout the length and breadth of the country.  They noted, for example, that the quality of sleeping accommodation was extremely poor in certain areas.  Members of the Defence Forces are often out protecting the State, perhaps for 24 hours at a time, when we are in our beds and they have totally inadequate living conditions.  Is it not a scandal that members of the Defence Forces are sleeping in such draughty conditions? I note in the same report that cardboard was being used instead of <Col N="1605" /> glass.  I do not know whether it was that glass was not available but in any event there was not available a maintenance man to fit it.  The fact remains that these people, who are protecting the State, were living and sleeping under those conditions. It is totally unacceptable that the workshops in various barracks are not up to the minimum statutory health and safety standards.</P>
    <P>I also note that the Commission recommend that working conditions at the Apprentice School should be improved to ensure that they comply with basic standards of FÁS training establishments. Surely that is not too much to expect?  Those requirements, small as they may be, need a commitment from the Government and a concerned Minister to provide the extra finance.  I very much regret that such finance has not been provided in the budget.  In the light of these problems, some of which I have highlighted and previously addressed in the course of my contributions on the Estimate &mdash; indeed I make no apology for repeating some of them here this evening &mdash; it is totally unacceptable that at a time when buildings and barracks are falling down, the Defence capital building programme has been further reduced by £2 million in the budget. Throughout the years the position in relation to the condition of buildings has been highlighted time and time again but the inadequate estimate has been further reduced by £2 million.  Perhaps the incoming Minister will take note of that. Expenditure has been reduced from £7 million to £5 million, a further indication, if one is required&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan, you appreciate that you will get ample opportunity for developing that matter presently.  Ordinarily, on a motion such as this, Deputies are expected to speak to its substance, which is the appointment of a member of the Government, and to deal with that specific appointment rather than policy or budgetary matters.</P>

      <P>With all due respects, a <Col N="1606" /> Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it is my responsibility to bring to the attention of the House and the incoming Minister the problems that exist and I make no apology for doing so.</P>

      <P>As I said, the Deputy will have ample opportunity to do that on the Estimates.  The Deputy cannot interpret the suitability of an occasion for his &mdash; or her &mdash; own purpose. That is not how we work.  The Deputy must apply himself to what the motion is about, as the order of the House requires. While there can be peripheral references to certain matters it is not good enough for the Deputy to say that he makes no apology to anybody because the Chair must administer the rules of the House as agreed upon by the Members of the House.  I ask the Deputy to relate to the substance of the motion, the appointment of a Member of the House to Government.</P>

      <P>I should like to bring the attention of the incoming Minister for Defence to the fact that the FCA have been run down over the years and their strength reduced to approximately 15,000.  In an effort to improve the morale of the force, the new Minister will have to address the problem regarding training, equipment and transport if he wants to encourage young people to join the reserve force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During Question Time on 25 October last I asked the then Tánaiste and Minister for Defence, Deputy Lenihan, to agree to the setting up of a representative body for members of the FCA and to give statutory effect to such an association.  In his reply the then Tánaiste and Minister cited the lack of experience in the operation of the new system for the Permanent Defence Forces as a reason for not agreeing to my proposal.  These delaying tactics are illogical and totally unacceptable and I now call on the new Minister to acknowledge the need for such an association and to meet the new representative body of the FCA at an early date.  I also call on the Minister to learn from the experience of a previous <Col N="1607" /> Minister who refused to acknowledge the constitutional right of members of the Defence Forces to set up their own representative association.  I look forward to the Minister being in a position to report progress in the establishment of this organisation when he comes before us to answer questions as Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the Department of the Environment.  It was a pity that the Taoiseach did not move the Minister Deputy Flynn from that Department.  It is not a personal comment on the Minister, but the Taoiseach should have availed of this opportunity to change the policies emanating from the Department of the Environment because they affect many ordinary people.  There is a local authority housing crisis in every constituency.  The Minister stated, time and time again, that there was not a crisis but I should like to relay a case history affecting my own constituency and indeed every constituency.  I refer to the plight of ordinary people who do not have a home of their own.  Until such time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am merely taking up the issue and I make no apology for saying that the Taoiseach should avail of the opportunity to have a major reshuffle so that ordinary people will see an improvement in their standards of living and will not have to put up with the deplorable situation which now exists.  As long as I am here I will raise the matter in this House.</P>

      <P>On 12 December last, Deputy John Bruton raised the question of the functions of the Minister for Defence.  During the course of the debate on that matter the Leader of The Workers' Party, Deputy De Rossa, referred to the functions the Taoiseach was performing at that time and asked the Taoiseach the following question, as reported at column 2145 of the Official Report: &ldquo;Would he not agree that it is not unacceptable that the Taoiseach, with the onerous duties that his position carries with it, should also have responsibility for the Gaeltacht, the arts, culture, women and defence?  It is time for him to shed some of these responsibilities&rdquo;, to which the Taoiseach replied with aplomb, &ldquo;And still they gazed and still their wonder grew&rdquo;, which is a quotation from The <Col N="1609" /> Deserted Village by Oliver Goldsmith. Let me quote further from that poem, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as I know you are someone with an interest in such matters and this could also refer to the Taoiseach, perhaps on different lines:</P>
      <P>A man severe he was, and stern to view;</P>
      <P>I knew him well, and every traunt knew;</P>
      <P>Well had the boding tremblers learned to trace</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here today discussing the appointment of a new Minister for Defence to succeed Deputy Brian Lenihan.  There has been much discussion on the question of whether the Minister for the Environment was asked to move, whether Deputy Ahern fancied a move to the Department of the Environment and whether the Minister for Education fancied a move to the Department of Labour but I do not know where the truth lies.  Some well known political correspondents seemed to hold very firm views as to the position but those views differed from those of the Taoiseach. However, the Taoiseach has gone on record and I will go along with that though I am somewhat sceptical.</P>
      <P>It was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 31 October last that the then Minister for Defence had a meeting with the Taoiseach.  In an article by Denis Coghlan it was stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After his first meeting with Mr. <Col N="1610" /> Lenihan at Kinsealy yesterday, Mr. Haughey told journalists that Mr. Lenihan &ldquo;didn't offer his resignation, nor did I seek it.  Anything of that nature would be a matter for my old friend, Brian Lenihan, personally.  I would not put pressure on him in that regard, nor would any of his colleagues&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As to whether Deputy Flynn has been asked to move, I do not know; we can only hazard a guess.  This is where the matter will have to lie for the moment.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Daly on his appointment as Minister for Defence and wish him well in that position.  I think we entered the House at around the same time and, in the period I have known the Deputy, I have considered him a man of honesty and integrity.  I would also like to congratulate Deputy Flood on his appointment as Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The only point I would make in regard to the appointment of Deputy Daly as Minister for Defence is that the Taoiseach some time back did not consider him competent to look after the Department of the Marine.  However, there is now a change of mind.  The Department of the Marine is of importance but we are now going through a difficult period, having regard to the Gulf crisis, our neutrality and the question of a European defence policy, and Defence is one of the key Cabinet portfolios.  What concerns me is that when Deputy Daly was Minister for the Marine he was hung out to dry by his colleagues.  I cannot recollect one speech made by any of his colleagues in support of him at that time.  He was isolated and received very little support. Given that he did not receive support on the rod licence issue I would be concerned about the level of support he would receive as Minister for Defence if he runs into difficulties again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Government well but the Taoiseach has missed a glorious opportunity to put a bit of zip, vim and energy into what I consider to <Col N="1611" /> be a very tired Government.  I do not know the reason he has not taken a look at some of the younger people in his party given that he has spoken about our youth and considers them to be our greatest treasure.  There are many youthful members on the Government back-benches and at some stage the Taoiseach should take a look at them in an effort to bring them on.  Many people believe that he leads a tired Government.  The bringing in of younger people could only lead to an improvement in the overall performance of the Government.  There is a need for change in the Government but one thing that does not need to be changed, and very few will disagree with me on this, is their public relations operation which is par excellence.  There is a need for change, however, at the Cabinet table and I say that with no disrespect to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of a local authority for nearly 25 years and in all that time I have never come across a situation as serious as the housing shortage at present at local level.  It is the worst I have come across and merits consideration.  It is heart breaking to have to deal with young mothers and fathers in my consituency who are looking for a home and who are being forced to live in expensive flats, or in mobile homes which are in bad condition.  This matter needs to be tackled because if children fall into poor health at a young age it can afflict them right throughout their lives.  Many of the young mothers and fathers that I deal with are rapidly losing hope and that is what concerns me.  When in Government we took mighty stick from Fianna Fáil who were then in Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We brought in reconstruction grants at that time for pre-1940 houses.  Recently, I met a person who is living in a pre-1940 house.  In fact, the house which is thatched is pre-1840, has no water or sewerage facilities, no electricity and a couple of bad bedrooms. The owner cannot get a grant to improve the house.  Surely, it is time that such cases were looked at.  The people concerned in this case have been put on the housing list but I am afraid they will be on it for a long time.</P>
      <P>With regard to health, the allocation for the Midland Health Board has been cut by £1.4 million, while doctors and nurses in hospitals in that region are both nervous and apprehensive about their futures and that of their hospitals.  With a shortfall and a cutback at that level there are bound to be job losses.  At present people have to pay for their own operations.  Some people on unemployment assistance or the dole have to pay for operations.  This is 1991 and people who, on occasion do not have enough to eat have to pay for operations. They are going to make it worse. They are going to bring in 100 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not time to argue with you now, Sir.  All I want to say is that Deputy Lenihan is a distinct loss to that Government, and I mean that in the <Col N="1613" /> very best sense.  He was one of the people who, in the Cabinet room, had an understanding of real life in rural Ireland and since he departed from the Government they have gone backwards.</P>
      <P>To conclude, I want to refer to the deserted village.  Go into church on a Sunday morning stand at the back and look up at the heads in front of you.  Most of these people are children under 15 and adults over 45.  Nearly everyone between the ages of 15 and 45 has gone to England, America or Australia.  There is a crisis and as far as I can see there has been a serious problem over the last number of years and with a certain amount of coverup it has been swept under the carpet by as good a PR team as this country has ever seen under the present Government. However, the chickens are coming home to roost.  Many people are very seriously concerned about what is happening but in spite of what the opinion polls say, I believe that at the next election many people will show their disapproval. An opportunity has been lost on this occasion to bring about badly needed improvements.</P>
      <P>Again I congratulate Deputy Daly and Deputy Flood and wish them every success in their new jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Brendan Daly on his nomination once again as Minister.  We all agree that he is a decent and honourable man.  He has always discharged his duties in a forthright and honourable fashion and I have no doubt that he will so do on this occasion.  I wish him every success in that office.</P>
      <P>I represent a constituency that has a large military establishment and I acknowledge he has been nominated to fill a very important role.  I ask him not to forget the importance of the Army in his role as a Government Minister.  I also ask him, please, not to allow himself to be elbowed from the coffers at the Cabinet table, which often happens, especially if a Minister is being appointed midstream in terms of a Government's life.  It is most important that he be as forthright as he always has been and that he would not become a casualty as, unfortunately, he did in a previous Government when he was the victim of circumstances.  It appeared to us on this side of the House that he was a victim of circumstances because nobody in his own party stood up and accepted responsibility for what developed in relation to the famous &mdash; now infamous &mdash; rod licence dispute.</P>
      <P>This occasion should not pass without my mentioning very briefly the circumstances which brought about this nomination today.  I would like to pay tribute to the former Tánaiste, Deputy Brian Lenihan, with whom we all have had a good working relationship over the years.  Everyone would agree that he always discharged his duty in an admirable fashion.  The point I want to refer to is that in a Coalition Government there is always a certain amount of tension, at least that is what the present Government used to tell us when we were sitting over there and we can only assume they knew what they were talking about.  I am quite sure they know better now.  It would appear that the unfortunate former Tánaiste was removed from office as a result of tensions that suddenly rose to the surface within the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to comment on here this evening is the possible implications and <Col N="1615" /> outcome of those tensions coming to the fore, and the manner and rapidity in which they came to the fore.  It appears to us and to the country in general that a member or members of the Government or Government parties were able to say at some stage that they wished to have him removed from office.  As a result he was removed, and public opinion and public confidence in the stability of Government was shaken.  That is the point I want to make here this evening and with that I will conclude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Deputy Daly on his nomination.  He is a courageous man having due regard to the pitfalls two previous holders of that office fell into &mdash; Deputy Noonan and Deputy Lenihan. Perhaps Deputy Daly feels that the Taoiseach, having held the position for three months, has broken the spell.  Time will tell.  Nevertheless, I congratulate the new Minister and wish him every success in this very important Ministry.  It is generally accepted that certain portfolios are &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo;.  That holds true no longer.  We are living in a time of change. People are demanding more.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have a role in peace time.  With barriers falling our Defence forces in the UN have brought to worldwide attention the knowledge that we can play a role in the UN in the very formidable task of peacekeeping.</P>
      <P>My regard for the Defence Forces came to the fore in the late sixties when there was an upsurge of violence in the Border area and members of the Defence Forces were billeted beside my home. That was when I gained first hand knowledge of them.  They were billeted alongside the road in poor conditions with no facilities.  I was delighted to be able to offer them some help and I came to know a number of them personally.  I have a high regard for them.  They are wonderful people.  We in Cavan are very proud of the barracks complex, one of the most modern in Europe, that has been built and recently opened there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me move now to the nomination <Col N="1616" /> of Minister of State, Deputy Chris Flood, to the Department of Health.  That has not been much commented on.  I compliment the Deputy on his very important nomination &mdash; I wish to comment on that Department in the budget debate.  I would like to see Deputy Flood given responsibility for the elderly.  I do not wish to be partisan and I note the Minister for Health is not here, but the Taoiseach could have taken this opportunity for a major reshuffle of his Cabinet because a number of Ministers have become stale and there are no new issues coming from them.</P>
    <P>It takes change to introduce pep into Government.  I hope that the new Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, will take responsibility for our elderly who are being neglected by this Government. We must remember that they served this country in hard times and did not contribute in any way to the national debt.  They received no benefit from the money squandered but are now being asked to stand in the front line and pay more than their fair share in the endeavours to bring down the national debt.</P>
    <P>I will give the House one example. Early this morning tears were brought to my eyes on receiving a telephone call from neighbours of the family of a 70-year old man in Cavan General Hospital who was being asked to leave, the doctors saying he was in good health and could go home.  What is home to him?  Home is to a 76-year old sister and 96-year old mother who are hardly able to look after themselves without being asked to look after another family member who is ill with no facilities in the house.  That is not an isolated incident but is repeated right across the country in rural areas, with many old people living alone without requisite facilities.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood; we have an excellent hospital in Cavan with excellent staff.  We also have an excellent nursing home but both are cramped so that there is no place for these elderly people to be accommodated.  This means that all they can do is admit them for a <Col N="1617" /> week or 10 days, examine them, administer some medical treatment and then send them home to a cold house with nobody to look after them.  All the young people have left.  That is not good enough in this day and age and is just not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to give the new Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, responsibility for our elderly, which would bring its reward.  Irrespective of how tight may be the budgetary constraints we cannot afford not to look after these people, who have worked hard and who can at least expect comfort at the end of their days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the new Minister for Defence, somebody I know on a personal level and whom I have always found to be accommodating and helpful.  I know he will do his utmost and I wish him well in his new role.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute also to his predecessor, Deputy Brian Lenihan who, in his period in office, was interested in improving the role and conditions of the Army.  Coming as he did from Athlone, with an army presence, I felt he understood and was interested in dealing with the problems encountered by the Army. Probably it is fair to say that it was the first occasion in a long period that Fianna Fáil had a Minister for Defence who was serious about improving the role and conditions of the Army and he will always be remembered for that.</P>
      <P>The new Minister has a difficult task ahead.  There are many issues relevant to the Army and the FCA requiring his immediate and wholehearted attention such as, for example, the remainder of the Gleeson Commission's recommendations on pay, allowances, pensions and gratuities and a revision of the manpower policies and establishment levels within the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past week I was contacted by the members of the FCA representative body, at their wits end about the circumstances now prevailing within the FCA.  For example, heretofore there was a two weeks camp provided for members <Col N="1618" /> of the FCA which has been cut back to one week.  Also their equipment and uniforms are in a deplorable condition. Indeed our youth, male and female, should be encouraged to join the FCA, to undertake training, discipline, giving them an interest and pride in their State, the basic role of any defence force.  Successive Taoisigh and Government Ministers deliver public speeches about the need for our youth to become involved in the affairs of the nation.  I contend that the FCA affords young people an opportunity to become involved and take a pride in their country by undertaking such training and, on other occasions, when asked, to help or support the permanent Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my congratulations to the new Minister for Defence and the new Minister of State at the Department of Health on their appointments.  I should like to express my regret that, since the thought of moving the Minister for the Environment from that portfolio never crossed the Taoiseach's mind, he did not avail of the opportunity of making changes in the Government to appoint a Minister with specific responsibility for housing to address the serious housing crisis particularly in regard to local authority waiting lists.  Every time I meet somebody whose name is on that waiting list, or who is homeless, I think of the Minister for the Environment.  I contend we could have done with a change in that Department so that somebody who would seriously address that problem could have been appointed.  Perhaps the present Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, will now turn his attention to this problem more seriously than he has done in the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>May I express some surprise also at the transfer of the Communications portfolio to a Minister who has already two very onerous portfolios.  I say that for two reasons.  There are a number of major problems prevailing in the communications area.  As I speak the two RTE orchestras stand suspended indefinitely, as a direct result of the policies of the previous Minister for Communications and of the financial restriction on RTE.  That is a problem to which the new Minister will have to devote his immediate attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I speak there is also on the Minister's desk a proposal from An Post which will have the effect of reducing the number of their employees by 1,200, of cutting the second postal delivery in the Dublin area, of closing down 700 subpost offices and of ending the house to house postal delivery services in rural areas.  I am surprised that the Taoiseach should have added the onerous portfolio of Communications, with all its attendant problems, to a Minister already holding two others, that he should not have availed of the opportunity to appoint a <Col N="1620" /> Minister of State to that Department, particularly as he has, very curiously, appointed a Minister of State at the Department of Justice having relieved the Minister for Justice of the Communications portfolio.</P>

      <P>I must confess to finding a great air of unreality about this debate, though I must acknowledge that towards the end it began to get more realistic in its general tenor.  There was a suggestion that I was in some way prevented from carrying out a reshuffle of the Government which I had intended.  I want to be categoric about that.  Many people in this House will agree that if I wished to take some course of action or not to take some course of action, the last thing that would interest me in that regard would be a press campaign one way or the other.  I never had any intention of carrying out a reshuffle and to the extent that much of this debate has been directed to this question of a reshuffle it has been totally unreal.  I do not want to carry out a reshuffle.  Why should I? There is a popular saying that if it is working well, then do not fix it.</P>

      <P>The people of Ireland, in so far as their views can be reflected in the polls, the vast overwhelming majority, an unprecedented majority, think this is the best and most successful Government this country has had for a long time.  The people may be misguided in that, and the Deputies opposite may know more than the people of Ireland, but so far as the plain people of Ireland are concerned this is a good Government, a successful Government and there is not a need to change it.  I have not any intention of changing it and neither a press campaign nor anybody anywhere will persuade me to change it.</P>
      <P>There is some question to the effect that I held on too long to the post of Minister for Defence.  I reject that.  I did not.  As a matter of fact, I found the period when I held the portfolio a very valuable and useful period, because as a number of Deputies here have pointed out, the portfolio of Defence and the Defence Forces have become a key important area of public administration. It is something to which we must give our attention more and more.  It was particularly valuable and helpful for me in those brief months to get to close grips with and to get a close association with the administration of the Department of Defence and with military matters, and particularly to get a feel for the situation in the Army, the thinking and the morale of the Army and to make my own assessment of how the Army are doing at the present time.  Far from being in any way detrimental, I value that period and I am glad I had the opportunity of getting that first-hand knowledge.</P>

      <P>One thing I do not like in this House is hypocrisy.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not forget that.  I remember the debates very well.  I would also join with Deputies who have been generous enough to commend and praise Deputy Lenihan for what he did during his period as Minister for Defence.  He did a great deal, I agree, and he made a major and determined effort to tackle the problems that were there and he transformed the whole situation.  I would also like to say that in doing that he got total unstinting support from me as his Taoiseach. Deputy Lenihan was responsible, with my support, for establishing the Gleeson Commission which has brought in an entirely new regime to our Defence Forces.  The recommendations of that Gleeson report are being implemented and will be implemented.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputies who talked about it here this evening, I would point out that a fundamental and major recommendation in that report which dealt with pay has been implemented and there is a major addition in the Book of Estimates to the cost of pay and allowances for the Defence Forces as a result of the Gleeson Commission recommendation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan asked today about another recommendation relating to a change in the method of promotion.  That is going ahead.  The recommendations in the Gleeson report are being consistently and steadily followed through and implemented and it will be Deputy Daly's job to make sure they are implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" /> I do not know if it is necessary at this stage to do it, but I want to say that all this campaign which was carried on earlier in the day, although it died out as the debate went on, about Deputy Flynn and the Department of the Environment and his refusal to move was completely and utterly without foundation.  There is not a scintilla of truth in that rumour.  I never had any intention of changing either Deputy Flynn from the Department of the Environment or Deputy Ahern from the Department of Labour. Why would I?  Both of them are doing excellent jobs in their Departments.  At the moment Deputy Flynn is engaged in a particularly important exercise with regard to local government reform in consultation with his Cabinet colleagues and it would have been totally inopportune, for that reason alone, to suggest that Deputy Flynn should be moved from that Department.  I want Members of the House to be open and honest about that matter.  They know that whatever else they may say about Deputy Flynn by way of criticism or otherwise, one thing people cannot take from him is his loyalty to his party and to his Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flynn is the sort of person who if at any stage I suggested to him that I wished him to take any particular course of action, as a loyal and dedicated member of this Government and of the Fianna Fáil Party, he would never hesitate to do what I asked. I hope that canard has been laid to rest once and for all.  I had no intention of <Col N="1624" /> rearranging the Government or of changing any of the Ministers in the Government because they are all doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>The people, whatever specious gibes the Opposition may make, know that this is a hard-working Government who are united in their purpose and are successful. That is basically what is at the root of this attempt to misread the situation and to misdirect criticism today. Deputies opposite know that this is the most successful Government this country has seen for a long time and the people know, recognise and acknowledge that fact.  That is what is bothering the Opposition, not whether Deputy Flynn or Deputy Ahern or any other Minister is moved.  That is why they are mounting these specious attacks on the Government and on the changes I am making.</P>
      <P>I have complete confidence in Deputy Daly.  I am certain he will do a good job in the Department of Defence.  I know that he will carry out in full the implementation of the Gleeson report.

      <P>As I stated on the last occasion we dealt with this Bill, the Bill as laid before the House is certainly not an answer in the retail area, and I am glad the Minister for Industry and Commerce has made it known that the parliamentary draftsmen are at an advanced stage in the preparation of a Government Bill to bring before the House.</P>
      <P>One of the problems with the existing legislation dealing with competition is that it is very piecemeal. What is now needed is a new comprehensive Bill to deal with today's problems in the retail marketing area.  The existing restrictive practices Acts and the orders relating to them are not the answer to the problem currently in the retail marketing area. Recent price wars, such as the &ldquo;bread war&rdquo; some months ago have done nothing to enhance the reputation of retail supermarkets in this country.  Competition is very healthy and is the life blood of retail marketing in Ireland and we have a very healthy retail grocery trade. However, competition for the sake of competition must be guided and I think it is unfortunate that we must put in place comprehensive legislation to deal with the whole area of competition.</P>
      <P>As I have said, we have some legislation on the Statute Book which covers various areas of the retail market but does not cover every aspect of the retail market, and some areas are outside the scope of the legislation.  For example, the retailing of seasonal goods and fresh fruit and vegetables perhaps can be brought under this new Bill which the Minister hopes to introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the experience in the <Col N="1629" /> retail marketing sector has not been very good as far as competition is concerned. When the Minister brings forward his legislation, and I hope it will be sooner rather than later, I hope all aspects of retailing will be looked at.  The Minister is to be commended on bringing forward this Bill with such haste.  I hope it will not be interpreted as a reaction to the Bill before us in the House.  I look forward to speaking on the new legislation when it is put in place.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I want to share my time with Deputy Kenneally.  The sooner the legislation which the Government are bringing forward is brought before the House the better it will be for all aspects of the retail sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to thank Deputy Nolan for sharing his time with me.  One of my problems will be in trying to fill the time because there is so little substance in the Bill and it is difficult to know what to speak about.</P>
      <P>The Bill is ill-conceived and is not well thought out.  The only reason I can see for the Opposition bringing it forward at this time is political opportunism.  The Bill is also contradictory.  Section 25 of the Finance Act, 1987, is referred to in it.  I do not intend to dwell at length on this point because the Minister did so when he spoke.  It appears that the section does not refer to liquid milk processing, yet section 4 (d) of the Bill refers to that subject and that I think is an example of the way the Bill is contradictory.  It is also misleading in relation to food processing because all that is referred to within the ambit of the Bill is milk and beef and it does not advert at all to the horticultural industry.  That surprises me greatly because this is an area of huge growth and has huge potential not only for the processing industry but in other areas which can and will create many jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will quote some figures to support what I say; they refer to 1986 because in the short time I had to prepare for this debate this afternoon they were the figures that came to hand most readily.  In <Col N="1630" /> 1986 we imported 224,028 tonnes of vegetables worth £54.8 million.  We also imported 36,420 tonnes of potatoes which had been preserved by freezing, to the value of £17 million.  In this country where we produce so many potatoes to such a high standard of quality and choice, why do we have to do that?  We can produce them here and can process them here and can create many jobs by doing so.  This is an important area that has not been adverted to at all.  Some of the previous speakers on my side referred to the mushroom industry particularly in Wexford and Monaghan where it has been very successful.  I know about this industry because I worked in this area before I entered this House.  It is a shame to see the number of foreign products coming into this country which could quite easily be replaced by our own goods.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of processing which has not been mentioned in the Bill is the whole area of packaging.  Packaging plays an extremely important role in processing and to a large extent we are failing in this regard in the horticultural industry.  If you walk into any retail outlet or supermarket you will notice that the quality of the presentation and packaging of foreign products, in particular Dutch products, is far superior to our own.  I am surprised this has not been mentioned in this Bill. Just imagine what could be done if we got our act together in that area in marketing various co-operatives.  This does not get a mention in the Bill, although supposedly it is a food processing Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett moved the Bill for Fine Gael and what struck me very forcibly about his contribution was that it was the contribution of an urban Deputy speaking largely on rural matters about which he knows nothing.  The constituency which he represents is largely middle to upper class and he purports to speak about agriculture.  His whole contribution was in relation to agriculture and he did not really mention processing, packaging etc.  He attacked Larry Goodman and the Goodman organisation; this Bill could be called the &ldquo;anti-Goodman Bill&rdquo;.  I have no brief to carry for Larry Goodman, <Col N="1631" /> good, bad or indifferent.  I am not for or against Mr. Goodman but I believe he did a tremendous job for agriculture in the past.  Even my colleague from Waterford, Deputy Deasy, who was previously a Minister for Agriculture and is now a Fine Gael Front Bench spokesperson on Agriculture and Food never concealed his admiration in the past for Larry Goodman and for what he did and yet his colleague attacked him right throughout his speech and at one stage he spoke about, and I quote, &ldquo;the misdeeds of one man&rdquo;.  I think that is very unfair.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I carry no brief for Mr. Goodman but I think this was a one-sided argument the whole way through.  There is no doubt the Goodman organisation brought farming on to a new level; I believe it brought it into the 20th century and we would possibly be languishing behind if it were not for what Mr. Goodman and the Goodman organisation achieved in the past.  That is not to say that they should have a monopoly, that they should control the beef or any other sectors of industry, but a reality, which has to be acknowledged, is the part he has played in the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Barrett also referred in his contribution &mdash; which seems a bit strange for somebody moving a Bill &mdash; to the inadequacies of his own Bill when he said he hoped the Minister would bring in a competition Bill to cover areas which were not covered by this Bill.  To cover the areas not covered by this Bill certainly gives the Minister tremendous scope because so little has been dealt with.  I am glad the Minister mentioned it is his intention to bring in legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>I am also amazed at the lack of awareness on the Opposition benches about the approach of 1993, because their provisions for restricting the share to 30 per cent of the market is, to say the least, ludicrous.  I think it will retard the growth of Irish companies as we become part of the Single Market.  There is no point in me referring to the example given by the Minister in his contribution when he referred to four companies who might <Col N="1632" /> have 25 per cent of the market in this country, yet if one goes out of business what is to happen?  There is no point in my following through that analogy again.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what we are in Europe. We are a small island nation of 3.5 million people.  If we were to restrict any company to 30 per cent of a particular market here it would mean they would have access to only 1.05 million people.  We are now entering the Single European Market in 1993 and there are 320 million people in the EC.  That means that Irish industries have a capacity to cope with 0.3 of 1 per cent of that market.  They cannot be expected to survive in that market.  Recently I gave an interview to a student who was doing a thesis in a college in Dublin.</P>

      <P>He had no tape.  We spoke about Ireland and the year 2000 and I told him what I expected would happen in that year in Ireland.  One of the most important things that will happen will be our entry to the Single Market in 1993.  I referred to my constituency because I am more familiar with industry in Waterford than in any other place.  I am aware of industries that have gone by the board over the last number of years for various reasons, without wishing to put the blame on anybody in particular.  I know there are many vibrant industries there giving gainful employment and I have no doubt they will survive in the future.  They are well managed and there is tremendous co-operation and understanding between management and the workforce.  The important thing is that they work together and that is the reason they are successful.  I am aware that that is repeated throughout the country and because of that I am confident as we face 1993.  If what is being proposed by Fine Gael in their Private Members' Bill comes into law that would put pressure on those companies.  It would retard growth in those companies and make it more difficult for them to <Col N="1633" /> compete in the general European market.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not take account of imports and exports and how they impact in Ireland and throughout the Community. They are a vital component of any area of market behaviour and this is something that must be recognised and understood by the Opposition.  A term used extensively in another debate in this Chamber not so long ago was &ldquo;level playing fields.&rdquo;  An effort is being made to put a slope on it with the Irish companies at the bottom of the slope and all our competitors at the top.  That is what this Bill would do.</P>
      <P>The 30 per cent referred to, and which appears to be almost a cornerstone of this legislation, reminds me of Ryanair and Aer Lingus and the aviation business and shows up the lack of thought in the Bill. Why should controls be brought into play in one area of the economy but not in another?  Perhaps that is something the Opposition intend would percolate through other areas.  What is supposed to happen in the aviation industry?  Ryanair and Aer Lingus operate on many routes from regional airports.  If we break it down to the fact that they can have only 30 per cent of the market each what do the other 40 per cent do to get to their destinations?  They cannot walk and perhaps the Opposition are suggesting they should swim.  That shows how ludicrous the Bill is.  It addresses one area but would percolate through the economy with disastrous consequences for many other industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at the outset it would be difficult to continue speaking about this legislation which deals almost exclusively with agriculture.  The challenge facing our farmers and our agricultural industry at processing and marketing levels is the creation of a super efficient industry so that we meet consumer requirements better than any of our competitors.  We have to look after the consumer and that should be the cornerstone of any legislation we introduce in the Chamber.  With certain controls in place we can always allow the forces of supply and demand to operate.  I do not think the Opposition <Col N="1634" /> parties are allowing that under the provisions of this Bill.  Irish farmers have the potential to be Europe's premier producers of food.  They could obtain premium prices on world markets but that requires the unwavering and combined commitment of Government, farmers and processors to reach that position. Because of the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy this can and must be achieved.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce legislation that will apply the principles of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome to the domestic trade. This will be comprehensive legislation as distinct from the piecemeal approach that is available under current legislation. This Bill continues that piecemeal approach and it must be rejected.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, there is very little substance in the Bill and it has not been well thought out.  I cannot see it doing anything for the economy.  I look forward to the legislation which the Minister will introduce.  I do not think there will be any argument in this House about the need for more competition legislation but this Bill does not adhere to that and it has to be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This Private Members' Bill moved by the Fine Gael Party could scarcely have drawn a more scornful response from the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the last night we debated it.  I hope the Minister's lofty disdain was aimed at the contents of the Bill rather than motivated by the customary Government response which is, apparently, that nobody, other than the Government have the right to move legislation, that the Government have a monopoly on good ideas and that, in any event, Private Members' Bills are usually imperfectly drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is clearly motivated by the Goodman experience.  It is ironic for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to chide Fine Gael for sponsoring legislation inspired by the Goodman affair when he last August was obliged to do precisely that with the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1990.  If I thought we could legislate <Col N="1635" /> to prevent the Goodman experience recurring I would be glad to do so.  I doubt if we can so long as the same cocktail of ingredients are present and, in any event, I do not believe this Bill is capable of doing so.</P>
    <P>It must surely be one of the extraordinary ironies of the entire Goodman affair that the legislation piloted through the House last August by the Minster for Industry and Commerce may yet facilitate the Goodman experience repeating itself.  I will come back to this point.</P>
    <P>It is true, and The Worker's Party accept this, that there are many legal anti-competition practices prevalent in our economy &mdash; unofficial cartels, collusion, price fixing and so forth.  Only today the battle continues to rage between the supermarket moguls concerning the price of bread.  Some people argue that the consumer will benefit from this price war but others argue, the trade unions among them, that ultimately this will end up costing us more jobs in our bakeries.</P>
    <P>Nobody can claim that the existing legislation on restrictive practices is acceptable or effective.  Certainly, the 1972 Act was convoluted, unwieldy, excessively bureaucratic and the procedures too slow to produce results.  The 1987 Act tidied up some of these weaknesses but has been very little used, which must be the test.  The Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, is already out of date since it takes no account of the imminent Single Market and was drafted and presented to the House purely in the context of the domestic economy.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Ray Burke, told the House on 7 February 1989 that his predecessor had asked the Restrictive Practices Commission to carry out an investigation of the case for and against the introduction of what he called the &ldquo;prohibitive type legislation&rdquo; similar to that in Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  The Minister was musing about the merits of changing from what he called a &ldquo;control of abuse system&rdquo; to a &ldquo;prohibition type system&rdquo; modelled on <Col N="1636" /> the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>On 7 February 1989 he told the House that he expected to have the report on the investigation &rdquo;within the next few months&rdquo;.  To the best of my knowledge that report is still unavailable.  When I tried today to chase up this report, find out if it is publicly available, where it is and if it can be made available at least to Members of the House, I was told that the commission have finished their report and that it is with the Minister but it is still not available to Members of this House.  In the context of the agreement on all sides of this House and in the light of changing market conditions and the need to confront free trade in the Single Market circumstances I find it difficult to understand why such an important report on our competition policy, promised to be completed within months of the statement on 7 February 1989, is still unavailable. If we are to go for a drastic change from the present system of anti-competitive legislation, such as it is, or the control of abuse system, as the Minister referred to it, towards a system which effectively imports the principles enshrined in Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome into domestic law then this matter requires the most detailed debate in this House and indeed a public debate generally.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to say in his reply when he is likely to make the findings of the commission available to the Members of this House.  I sincerely hope that they will not be kept under wraps until such time as the Minister for Industry and Commerce decides to introduce his own Bill, which he has promised, to tackle the abuses we are talking about here.  I can see no reason the rest of us should be asked to respond to a more comprehensive Bill by the Minister without the benefit of the expert views in that report.  If an expert committee or commission comprising people with expertise in this area have been requested to research the entire merits of such a revolutionary change in this area then it should be made available to the Members of this House before we have to respond <Col N="1637" /> to that legislation.  I say that because it is clear from the response in this House so far that there is no question of the Bill currently before us being enacted.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party believe that there is a need, in approaching the question of competition policy, to ensure a clear understanding among the public on competition policy because at present the details are incomprehensible in a great many respects.  There must be a balance between competition policy and other policy objectives of the European Community. This will require democratic accountability to the European Parliament, for example.  The annual European Commission report should play a vital role in this respect but it is regrettable that it is delayed year after year even despite strong protests and recommendations from the European Parliament itself.  Sufficient staff and resources are needed to ensure that it is produced in time.  In addition, the report has remained unchanged in structure for the past 15 years despite even more complexity in the competition area.</P>
    <P>The new Merger Control Regulations of December 1989 are to be generally welcomed but again it is regrettable that too many exceptions are allowed to the basic rules, resulting in legal uncertainty. A major objective of competition policy must be to create and maintain workable and effective competition in all sectors, not unrealistic or theoretical models. Competition should be carried out linked to other vital policy objectives of the Community such as strengthening of economic and social cohesion and the achievement of sustainable development. In this regard there should be a systematic review of the impact of new competition rules such as an economic, social and environmental audit which would examine the impact on employment levels, social security and regional development, among other issues.</P>
    <P>Competition policy rules are being introduced and implemented in the absence of a clear EC industrial policy which should include aid criteria in a far wider policy context.  Aid for disadvantaged regions should be allowed <Col N="1638" /> and available to combat the effects of any such new competition policy.  There is a need to open up competition between banks and the often closed liberal professions.</P>
    <P>The focus of the Bill we are asked to consider is, as has been said by a number of speakers, extremely narrow.  Even if the House was of the opinion that we can legislate for competition policy on a sectoral basis the scope envisaged by section 2 of the Fine Gael Bill is far too restrictive.  It seems, for example, that the definitions used of a company in the food processing trade would entirely exclude co-ops which control such a significant share of the food processing sector.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce was replying he indicated that it excludes milk sold on the liquid milk market.  Therefore, the focus of the Bill is very specific and betrays the fact that its paternity is solely due to the Goodman affair.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing that the scale of the Goodman affair and the potential, if not actual, damage done to our trading reputation as a country do not warrant specific scrutiny.  Goodman had such a dominant market share in the beef processing sector that the threat of a collapse for the livelihood of producers and factory workers seemed enormous.  Above all, Goodman operated the kind of price fixing cartel that must be a central concern of any revision of competition policy.  The complex and optimistic package put together by the examiner process originated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his legislation of August 1990 offers the very definite prospect of the Goodman organisation reverting to its old price fixing habits.  Indeed, so enormous is the surplus which must be generated in order to bail out the international banks, that the entire package is predicated on a healthy margin being available to the company.</P>
    <P>The group's examiner, Mr. Peter Fitzpatrick, is on record as saying &mdash; as reported on 29 January 1991 in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; that the outlook for the Goodman group for the coming year is &ldquo;less optimistic at this stage&rdquo;.  Any hiccup must <Col N="1639" /> inevitably mean that in order to preserve its margin the price to the producer must fall.  The system will be operated as an inbuilt tax on the farmer or supplier, the extent of which can be varied depending on market conditions.  The other factories will be only too delighted to be part of the cartel since the Goodman muscle guarantees these smaller players better margins, margins that they themselves could not win.  In return this will have a negative effect on job security and the nature and extent of employment in the beef processing industry.</P>
    <P>The imperative is a contribution of the order of £30 million whatever about the state of Irish agriculture.  This is the only way the international banks, whose greed and imprudence got them into this hole, can get their pound of flesh.  It is also the only way they can guarantee that Mr. Goodman will get back into the saddle. It is this scenario that the Minister for Industry and Commerce must now contemplate under the mergers and monopolies legislation.  The Minister's legislation has succeeded in rescuing Mr. Goodman and in holding out the prospect of effective control of the dominant market share of one of our major industries being reasserted by Mr. Goodman. This can scarcely be what was contemplated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In many ways, having regard to the track record and to the manner in which Mr. Goodman abused his dominant position in recent years, this is a nightmare scenario.  Why should the leopard change his spots now?  Is the freewheeling use of political influence to shut out competitors from facilities to which they were equally entitled the kind of free enterprise supported by Deputy O'Malley and the Progressive Democrats?  Mr. Goodman's organisation, in striving for a monopoly, broke the law.  That is well established.  I instanced, for example, on 28 August 1990 that the Goodman organisation had drawn down some of the £170 million package of section 84 loans for speculative purposes other than the purpose for which these loans were legally sanctioned.  However, if some of the <Col N="1640" /> group's technically illegal decisions helped precipitate the crisis, many of its anti-competitive practices were perfectly legal and, one suspects, in many cases had the active support of the Government. I instanced on 25 October 1990 in this House how, for example, Mr. Goodman used his political contacts to intervene at Government level in 1987 to cause the newly secured credit export insurance to Halal to be cancelled.</P>
    <P>The question being asked by farmers and meat factory workers is why should they be expected to work their butts off for private banks.  Is there sufficient capacity in the industry to take up the slack?  Is the Goodman Group essential any longer to suppliers who had cattle on the land last August?  If not, why become imprisoned by this vicious circle of debt which totals, in all, almost £600 million? Does Irish agriculture not already confront enough obstacles without tying this millstone around its neck?</P>
    <P>Whatever criticisms can be made of the narrow scope of the Fine Gael Bill, it raises this question.  It is all very well for Government backbenchers to criticise the Bill as being produced out of the Goodman experience, but the Goodman experience is of such a scale and so critical to one of the major industries that it is quite proper for any party in the House to bring forward legislation that focuses on the errors that were made in the past. The question now is that having brought forward very special legislation last August it amounts to no less than penalising the farmer as producer and meat factory workers to enable Mr. Goodman to rise Phoenix-like from the ashes and, all going well, to reassert himself in control of this enormous company.  That is the prospect that is held out to Irish farmers.  The enormous contribution of £30 million that is expected to service the debt can only be achieved if the margin is maintained.  If there are any difficulties in agriculture &mdash; we know there are a great many &mdash; that margin can only be sustained by imposing a further tax on the farmer or producer.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of dilemma that now, ironically, faces, above all Ministers, <Col N="1641" /> Deputy O'Malley; the same Minister who was prominent in seeking to use parliamentary privilege, quite properly, when in Opposition to expose some of Mr. Goodman's more dubious practices must now decide whether to give Mr. Goodman a new lease to torment the industry again.  Deputy O'Malley must lie awake at night at the realisation of how cleverly the two politicians most closely associated with Goodman's rise &mdash; the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds &mdash; have passed the buck to him.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Cabinet Ministers found it easier to avoid dealing with some of the very serious charges raised by me and other Deputies in the House because the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, happened to be the Minister directly concerned with this portfolio.  Now the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, finds himself having to give the seal of approval to a new Goodman monopoly.  Where it may be claimed that effective control lies with the banks, he knows that, the banks have made it quite clear that they are dependent on Mr. Goodman and that if the project is successful Mr. Goodman will be restored in actual as well as in effective control.  That is one of the central questions that must be addressed in any revision of competition policy.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to one of the criteria used by Fine Gael in bringing forward this Bill which seeks to arbitrarily fix a ceiling on the market share of any enterprise.  I would like to quote a remark made by the Minister on this aspect when replying to the Fine Gael Bill.  He said:</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it is realistic to fix an arbitrary fixture as a ceiling on the market share of any enterprise in a particular sector.  The extent to which competition exists, or can exist cannot be decided in the abstract by reference to some automatic formula.  It is a matter that requires examination on a case by case basis.  The market share held by one enterprise has to be judged in the light of other factors including the share, actual and potential, of others in the market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> I tend to agree with that summary.  The first mistake in the Fine Gael Bill is that it is too restrictive and, secondly, it seeks to fix this arbitrary ceiling on market share.  I fully appreciate that, in saying that, it must be juxtaposed with what I have just said about the experience of the Goodman affair where dominant market share was used to squeeze out competitors and ruthlessly used to fix prices and so forth.  Nonetheless, in the international climate in which we are seeking to function.  I do not think that the Fine Gael solution of breaking up the Goodman Corporation into tiny companies is the answer; I do not think that, in 1991, in an industry like agriculture, where we have so many advantages, it is desirable to have a proliferation of small companies attempting to compete internationally. Whereas people may say that the scale of this company is enormous by Irish standards &mdash; or the scale of half a dozen other companies is enormous by Irish standards &mdash; the facts of the matter are that, on the European canvas, they are minute by comparison.  That does not apply to the Goodman group but, generally speaking, our largest companies are minute by comparison with the large-scale players in the European scene.  If we are to secure &mdash; and win &mdash; new markets we must have large-scale companies if we are to be successful.  For that reason, it is a mistake to seek to impose an arbitrary ceiling as suggested here.  There are a great deal of technical objections that one could make to this proposal and, in his response on the last night, the Minister for Industry and Commerce dealt with some of them.</P>
    <P>Of course it is an entirely different matter when some of these very large companies use various techniques in order to circumvent the law, weak and ineffective though it might be.  For example, we would all have been a great deal wiser if the normal requirements with regard to disclosure of company information had been made to apply in the Goodman case and indeed in other cases.  However, Mr. Goodman sought to circumvent that by the use of unlimited liability and we know how effective that was <Col N="1643" /> in terms of him ensuring that he could salt away his personal millions and leave us in this House tearing our hair out as to what would happen the farming community last autumn and where they would get markets for their cattle which would be ready at the back end of the year.  Mr. Goodman did use the privilege of unlimited liability through the labyrinthine structure of his group of companies to evade his responsibilities under the disclosure of information legislation.</P>
    <P>In abusing the Fine Gael effort and pouring scorn on it, the Minister promised us legislation of his own.  I wonder to what extent this legislation will be informed by the traditional views of the Department of Industry and Commerce as we received them from the then Minister, Deputy Burke, during the debate on the Progressive Democrats' Bill in February 1989 or whether it will be informed by the Progressive Democrats' approach to this legislation.  It will be very interesting to watch the shape and nature of the legislation when it emerges but it is clear, from what we know about the view of the Progressive Democrats on it, that if the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, holds firm to that view, the thrust of the legislation will be to attack what he calls &ldquo;the monopolies of the State and semi-State companies in this economy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are now being asked to accept that the conventional wisdom is that various deregulations which have already taken place have been good for the consumer. It was regularly instanced &mdash; and it was this evening &mdash; that the intrusion of Ryanair was to the benefit of the consumer to a very measurable extent and that, therefore, air fares deregulation and competition in the air industry is a good thing.</P>
    <P>There is now very considerable evidence available to challenge that conventional wisdom.  If I may take two examples: the first deals with the question of air transport and I should like to quote &mdash; not from any Workers' Party policy document &mdash; but from the <i>Financial Times</i> of Monday, 18 June 1990 as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> Since the law deregulating the US airline industry came into force in 1978 more than 200 airlines have disappeared or been absorbed by a clutch of giants.  Before that year the five biggest American airlines controlled 63 per cent of passenger business in the US.  But, rather than reducing concentration in the American industry, deregulation has increased it.  The five largest airlines now control more than 70 per cent of traffic and dominate key airport hubs.</P>
    <P>You can apply that situation readily to the Irish experience.  Already the Ryanair bubble is beginning to burst.  There is an enormous accumulated deficit of almost £30 million and favourable measures by the Minister for Tourism and Transport to bail them out and give them free passage on choice routes, and the promise now, if Aer Lingus are permitted, to take over Ryanair.  The withdrawal of British Airways leaves us in a less competitive situation, on the London-Dublin route in particular.  For how long will this benefit to the consumer last and at what cost?  In that respect I should like to quote very briefly, as I am running out of time, from a report prepared by the transport studies unit of the University of Oxford in respect of bus deregulation which the Minister for Transport cannot wait to bring before us.  In that particular area the policy study group concluded as follows.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that deregulation has been accompanied by a reduction in the costs of running bus services.  This, being one of the main aims of the proponents of deregulation, could be interpreted as being one of the major successes. When these cost reductions are studied more closely it is apparent that most have resulted from the following sources: (a) relative wage reductions for staff; (b) transfer to minibus operations which have lower costs per mile and cheaper staff wages, and (c) lower investment in new vehicles.  In simple terms the cost of tendered operations in terms of subsidy appear to be much <Col N="1645" /> cheaper than the previous system of blanket subsidy.  However, when other costs are broken down it is apparent that the new system is costing nearly as much as the old system even though it is much cheaper in terms of providing vehicle miles.</P>
    <P>I could go on in that vein and, no doubt, we will have an opportunity to do so when the Minister brings forward his own legislation.</P>

      <P>Speaking in this House before Christmas, the Minister for Industry and Commerce identified the Competition in Food Processing Bill as being a cheap and cynical attempt to gain easy publicity.  This is exactly what it is.  The Minister took the time to go through the Bill and point out the serious shortcomings and misguided approach adopted in bringing forward such legislation.</P>
      <P>Indeed in reading the contributions of Opposition Deputies to the opening debate before Christmas, it is quite obvious that the alleged objective to improve the competitive environment has not been seriously thought out or given the depth of consideration that it merits.  Not only does the Bill barely scratch the surface of the problem of competition but, given the opportunity to expand on their thinking, the Deputies I have heard on the other side have not even begun to understand what is involved in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this subject.  The importance of competition policy was recognised in the Programme for Government and endorsed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Government and the social partners agree that a comprehensive approach prohibiting anti-competitive behaviour is necessary to stimulate competition in the domestic economy &ldquo;so that the traded sectors will not have to bear the costs imposed by anti-competitive practices in more sheltered local businesses&rdquo;.  This is the reason the Government will shortly be introducing a Competition Bill which will give <Col N="1646" /> effect in domestic law to provisions similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty. The provisions of the Treaty prohibit anti-competitive agreements and practices and the abuse of a dominant position in the market for trade between member states.  Using this as a model, the Government will be introducing similar provisions applying to trade within the State.</P>
    <P>With the signature of the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we start into a new phase of economic and social planning and stability. We have created a framework within which we can plan ahead with confidence.  In the programme we have also given certain undertakings, one of which is to see that legislation is introduced to improve the competitive environment for Irish business.  The Government, through the programme, have created a positive economic framework. For our part, we will ensure Irish business operates in the most favourable economic and legislative framework.  In creating these conditions we also expect Irish business to play their part.  The drive for new markets and maintaining a competitive edge must be the responsibility of the firm.</P>
    <P>I want to speak for a few moments about the content and objectives of the Bill.  Deputy Spring said in his intervention in December that he did not believe any party can claim to have all the knowledge, wisdom or best ideas on how to deal with reforming legislation in this area and conceded that the Bill before us could do with some improvement. This must have been the most honest intervention of the debate. Regrettably, the Competition in Food Processing Bill reflects only the dimmest flicker of knowledge.  There are several serious flaws in this Bill.</P>
    <P>First, why draw up legislation which is clearly needed on a broad basis for one sector of the economy only?  I can understand the concern for the food processing sector, but why single it out?  Why would we want to apply separate rules for economic behaviour to one sector of the economy and not others?  Indeed, not only does the Bill seek to apply to one sector <Col N="1647" /> only but it is now clear that it only seeks to apply to part of that sector.  The Opposition seem to be obsessed with, and refer continuously to, a particular company in the context of this Bill.  That would not be proper legislation and legislation that I would subscribe to.  It would not apply to the preparation of milk for the liquid milk market, for example.  The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has on many occasions spoken out against the anti-competitive practices evident in this area.  The rationale behind applying rules on such a piecemeal basis is mystifying to say the least.</P>
    <P>There are many other sectors in the economy which could merit such attention. I am sure Deputies will be familiar with problems in their own areas and with problems at more general national level. We often hear talk that some group is operating a &ldquo;ring&rdquo; or collusively fixing the price or market.  Is this right, and, if not, should we not attack the problem in a comprehensive manner?</P>
    <P>A second major fault in the Bill is the fixing of a ceiling of 30 per cent on market share for companies involved in either beef or dairy processing.  The most confusing thing of all is that this 30 per cent is not related in the text of the Bill to the concept of abuse of dominant position.</P>
    <P>Are we to presume that just because a company is big it is bad?  Conversely, could a company which has a dominant position in the market but which has less than 30 per cent of market share be free from the penalties suggested in the Bill? Are we to hatchet all companies who, by virtue of their enterprise, have expanded and grown?  This is tantamount to punishing success.  Would the sponsors of this Bill like to explain this to the Irish business community?  Furthermore, as Irish business seeks to compete in the barrier-free market of the European Community it would not be appropriate to constrain their efforts because of populist opposition to company size.</P>
    <P>As a third and general comment, it is a pity that the Bill does not pay more attention to the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  The new <Col N="1648" /> sections 4A and 4B proposed in section 3 of the Bill bear some resemblance to the provisions of the Treaty.  If care had been taken to look at the operation of these Articles and the legislation which has derived from these provisions, perhaps we might have been spared some of the more obvious failings of this proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Let us pause for a moment to look at existing legislation controlling competition in this country.  The Restrictive Practices Acts and orders are the primary focus of our approach to competition. They are an extremely useful method of controlling anti-competitive behaviour. With the increasing complexity and growing internationalisation of economic activity, it has, however, become very evident that a new approach should be explored.</P>
    <P>We now need a broad based approach that will bring us into line with mainstream thinking in this area in the European Community.  It makes sense for us to have the same set of rules here as our partners in the Community.  It also means that companies here will be well prepared for doing business with Europe.</P>
    <P>It has also become clear that the approach under the Restrictive Practices Acts has become outdated and even clumsy.  Making a restrictive practice order takes time.  It requires a series of stages involving investigations and reports and ministerial orders with confirmation by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>What the Government have in mind under their new Competition Bill is to replace this system with a simpler approach introducing a general prohibition on anti-competitive business behaviour.  This will be far more simple and straightforward.</P>
    <P>Although the Opposition speakers seem to have at least tacitly accepted that this new approach is warranted, they insist, with this Bill, in bringing us backwards instead of forward along the road I have just identified.  Instead of building on the useful experience in EC and European legislation, the Opposition now want us to tack on a piece of ineffectual piecemeal legislation on the existing body <Col N="1649" /> of restrictive practice orders.  I wonder why they did not try to call it a restrictive practices Bill.</P>
    <P>We have not heard a word from the sponsors of this Bill about the rationale for a competition Bill.  There are several questions we should ask before we start drawing up legislation for an area like this.  Who benefits from competition and who loses from it?  The most obvious beneficiary is the consumer.  As competitive market forces come into play the consumer has a greater choice at keener prices than before.  This can easily be seen in the local supermarket where price competition between branded goods gives the consumer a real choice.  Indeed, increased competition is also good for business, at least those businesses who are not afraid of competition and of changing with the times.</P>
    <P>Those businesses which look to the benches opposite for direction will be left behind on the scrap heap. They will be the losers from competition.  They may have made huge profits in the past in false markets but they will no longer be able to do so.  The consumer should no longer have to subsidise profit racketeers.</P>
    <P>In controlling business behaviour in a manner similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, the Government will be introducing in their Competition Bill a fair and equitable regime in which there will be benefits for all.  The Government will be introducing a broad based Bill which will meet the needs of the Irish economy and set a new legislative framework in which all sectors of Irish business and, equally important, consumers will benefit.</P>
    <P>At this stage we recommend that the sponsors of the Bill should withdraw this Bill because as I and my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, have explained, it will be totally ineffective and has been badly prepared.  My Department are working on the legislation which the Minister will introduce in this House.  The Bill before the House should be withdrawn as it is not suitable in the circumstances.  The <Col N="1650" /> Bill the Government will be bringing forward will receive support on all sides of the House because it will be very comprehensive and will be ideally suited to the changing times ahead.  As we proceed to 1992 it is vital that this legislation be brought forward.  The Government are conscious of this and I assure the House that we are doing our utmost to bring it forward, as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is complex legislation and that is why I say, with respect to Opposition Deputies and parties, that they are not in a position to draw up such a Bill without the support and advice of a Government Department and the Attorney General's office.  I understand and appreciate the constraints of being in Opposition.  I recall some years ago when in Opposition bringing forward legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to prepare legislation, even with the assistance of the House, particularly on an issue as complex as competition and have it in line with European legislation.  The Bill does not address the issues we will be dealing with in our legislation.  A great deal of time has been spent in the House on this issue when in a sense it would have been better if the Opposition benches had the patience to allow our legislation to be brought forward.  The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, is interested in this legislation and is anxious to bring it forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have outlined the shortfalls of this legislation and there seems to be an obsession on the Opposition benches about one company in the State who ran into difficulties which now it is hoped will be resolved.  It is not appropriate that one issue or company should lead to a rush to bring in legislation for party political or publicity reasons which may be behind this decision.  More detailed analysis is required than has been put into this Bill. It is a rushed, shabby affair and does little justice to the people who prepared it.  We <Col N="1651" /> are quite clear on our stand.  We will be voting against the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad that some speakers, including Deputy Rabbitte, recognise that the 30 per cent rule in section 3 is unrealistic. That proposal takes no account of the Single Market.  Judging matters exclusively by reference to the Irish market is outdated.  We should not interfere with company size in such a context.  We need to regulate behaviour.  That is the essence of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  It will be the centre-piece of the Government's Bill.  This 30 per cent rule would be most damaging and restrictive on companies here who are competing in Europe and will, of course, face greater competition after 1992 against bigger companies.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate or beneficial to the Irish economy to restrict the growth of companies.  Small may be beautiful but size is necessary in the context of 1992 to ensure that Irish companies employing Irish people succeed, progress, build, expand and develop post 1992.  We have great opportunities in the Europe of 1992 and I have no fears about the ability of Irish industry to face the challenge.  We are constantly working with companies, aquainting them with the changes in legislation and the great progress that was made during the Government's Presidency of the EC in the first half of 1990.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, who spearheaded our Presidency of the EC.  The planning that went into the preparation for the Presidency paid off.  It is recognised in Europe that our Presidency of the EC was the most outstanding for a long time. Our Ministers and our excellent Civil Service contributed greatly to that success.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the need for legislation in this field arising out of our attendance at meetings of Councils of Ministers and our success during our Presidency in bringing forward new rules under the Single Market.  Those rules will allow for competition in fields heretofore closed off to competition in Europe, for <Col N="1652" /> instance in telecommunications, the provision of electricity and water systems. They were opened up during our Presidency, but to compete with European firms in telecommunications or the distribution of electricity we need very large firms.  Fortunately, we have two major firms in Telecom Éireann in the telecommunications sector and the Electricity Supply Board, semi-State companies who are in a position, and will be in future, to compete in the Single European Market and obtain major contracts.</P>
    <P>I am always impressed by the work of Irish companies, for example M. F. Kent from Clonmel, who succeed in getting contracts around the world against the biggest companies in the world.  They employ Irish architects, engineers and technicians.  Such companies are sourcing the majority of their products in Ireland. Why should we stand in the way of the progress of companies like those I mentioned? As Minister of State responsible for Trade and Marketing I have visited Irish companies when abroad and I have been on some of their sites in Spain.  I was very impressed to see our highly skilled Irish men and women working and competing with the biggest and best in Europe and winning out.  What is to be the largest hotel in Spain is being built by an Irish company.  That is a great indication of the strength and success of Irish companies.  But they must be large in order to allow for development and expansion and we should not stand in their way.  It is my considered belief that the Bill before the House would constitute a retrograde step and would run counter to business development in that regard.  We will bring forward properly prepared legislation, conscious of the needs of and opportunities for Irish companies abroad, so that we will not stand in their way, in creating much needed employment at home.</P>
    <P>The question was posed here this evening as to what will be the philosophy that will underline the Government Bill, whether it will be that of the Department or of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I should say that advisers merely <Col N="1653" /> advise but Governments decide and the philosophy underlying our proposed Bill will be that of the Government as outlined in the Programme for Government and agreed by the Government.  The Minister himself is deeply involved in the preparation of this Bill whose heads have been approved collectively by Cabinet agreement.  I want to make it quite clear that it is Government philosophy that is involved based on the advice of our excellent Civil Service.  It has been the practice in this House not to criticise civil servants who cannot answer for themselves here, a practice I stand over. Having had the experience of working with various civil servants in various Departments I can say that perhaps they are sometimes better regarded in Europe than at home.</P>

      <P>In a European context I would contend that our Civil Service is the best.  I have had much experience of working with them in the European context, within the context of the GATT discussions and of our Presidency of the EC during which time our civil servants chaired important meetings convened by their counterparts throughout Europe, whose appreciation and admiration of our civil servants was conveyed to me by other EC Ministers.</P>
      <P>While there are excellent advisers available within the Department of Industry and Commerce, at the end of the day it is the Minister who must bring forward legislation encompassing the best advice available to him within his Department, and from the Attorney General.  I must emphasise that the Minister is giving preparation of this Bill priority because he is conscious of the need for it.  It is a very complex Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one which must be prepared very carefully.  On Committee <Col N="1654" /> Stage we will be afforded an opportunity to tease out its every section.  I hope we will have the full co-operation of Members of the Opposition in ensuring its speedy passage.  I fully accept the need for its introduction and we will not be found wanting in bringing it forward.  This Government have a record second to none in introducing complex legislation. My Department were responsible for bringing forward the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, one of the most outstanding Bills to come before this House for some time and which necessitated enormous effort on the part of so many people over so many years.  Many successive Governments failed to do so, including the Coalition Government of 1982-87, who were either unable or unwilling to introduce that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have published a Bill but it is more important to have such a Bill passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have passed that legislation into law, it having passed through the hands of so many Ministers of that former Coalition Government.  I was aware of the divisions within that Government in regard to that legislation when many Ministers of different persuasions came into the Department, all effecting their changes to it.  Yet it took this Government and my Department to introduce it.  We will do the same with regard to our proposed Bill in relation to competition in the food processing industry.  We look forward to debating this Bill.  In the circumstances it would be wise for the Opposition to withdraw their Bill and await the publication of ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State who has just spoken described the Fine Gael proposal in regard to competition in the food processing industry as very dull.  All I can say is that I hope the filibustering in which the Minister engaged in the course of his contribution &mdash; ranging from hotels in Spain to future prospects in terms of competition legislation &mdash; is not <Col N="1655" /> an indication of what will be enshrined in the Government Bill to be introduced in this House.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Bill is motivated by a genuine concern at the lack of competition in many sectors of the food industry. It is essential that legislation be enacted to ensure that a dominant individual, or group of individuals, cannot suppress the price of a product to the producer or inflate its price to the consumer.</P>
      <P>Recent events in the Irish food industry clearly indicate the importance of competitiveness in the Irish food sector.  It creates a very poor impression &mdash; in fact that of a corrupt economy &mdash; when a private individual can gain access to huge amounts of unsecured finance to satisfy his personal greed, with the support of Government, while at the same time a less influential individual probably would require a deed of property, life assurance cover or even a personal guarantee from a member of his or her family in order to set up a small business here at present.</P>
      <P>Is it not equally disturbing to realise that, since Fianna Fáil returned to Government in 1987 &mdash; when the Minister present became a Minister of State &mdash; personal patronage to friends of Fianna Fáil has made many people rich through various nods and winks, favourable tax legislation, while the less-privileged competitor must seek to sustain and expand a business development against those considerable influential odds?  I would have to be honest and say that, when it comes to looking after one's own, the players in this Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Coalition Government go back a long way together in terms of looking after people and their friends, sometimes at taxpayers' expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the return of Fianna Fáil to Government in 1987 the State has succeeded in bringing competition in food processing to a standstill.  For political and financial reasons the Government decided to hinge the entire development of the beef processing sector onto one individual company under the control of Mr. Larry Goodman.  The Minister of <Col N="1656" /> State present will recall the huge publicity given in 1987 to the launch of the food drive in the beef sector when the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, said that our food industry would henceforth be on the fast track with a huge investment of £250 million, with IDA support, to one meat company here.  It was a Government decision to vest the overall development of the beef sector in one individual.  That was not a Fine Gael but a Fianna Fáil decision and the Minister of State should remember that.  By way of Government intervention, European assistance and exclusive IDA grants the Goodman Group built up a massive food processing empire which finally developed difficulties, not because of a threat of BSE, the withdrawal of export credit insurance or the Gulf war but by the greed of one individual and various policy decisions on the part of the Government of the day to the detriment of our economy and taxpayers.</P>
    <P>In spite of the tremendous gusto and gung-ho statements on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he contributed to the debate on this Bill, and even when in Opposition, he has continued to support the Goodman Group through the enactment of favourable legislation in August 1990 and his failure to refer the latest High Court package for consideration under the provisions of the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister for Industry and Commerce that if he does not refer this package under the above mentioned Act he will be seen as a Minister who has huffed and puffed over the years about the desirability of competition in all aspects of economic activity but who will have capitulated at the last moment and sanctioned a rescue package for a company that will allow a private individual 90 per cent control of his company again in seven years time at the expense of food producers in this country.  So much for competition in the food industry when that same company and individual will continue to command over 40 per cent of the trade. <Col N="1657" /> This High Court rescue package clearly demonstrates the potential role of the new position of Examiner under the 1987 Companies Act.  I warn the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the flexibility shown by the Examiner in the case of the reconstruction of the Goodman Group could have serious implications for lending policy by financial institutions in this country.  There is no doubt in my mind that it will make it much more difficult to satisfy financial institutions about adequate security in respect of financial undertakings because of the experience of the court procedures and the role of the Examiner in this recent case.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be able to give assurances that other self-employed people whether in business or agriculture will not be victimised by financial institutions in respect of requests for lending facilities and thereby create unfair competition in the lending market.</P>
    <P>There is an impression created here in Ireland that the Common Agricultural Policy indicates equality of treatment for all member states in the European Community. However, nothing could be further from the truth.  There are major divergencies between member states in respect of geographical location, economies of scale, stage of economic development, financial position, interest rates, inflation rate and so on.  Therefore, it is imperative that Ireland seeks to fight its case in Europe taking account of the condition of the various factors that I have mentioned and seek to win approval for our special position on the periphery of Europe and our generally under-develped economic and infrastructural needs and our distance from the centre of the European Market <i>vis-à-vis</i> other member states.</P>
    <P>It is important in the development of the food industry that we are able to articulate the importance of the agricultural industry to our country and exploit our natural advantages over our European counterparts in the community.</P>
    <P>I regret that this Government have not appeared to be succeeding in recent times <Col N="1658" /> when one considers the mess the Irish Commissioner for Agriculture is making with reforms under the CAP and indeed in the GATT negotiations.  We have a Minister for Agriculture who was a former Commissioner and a Commissioner for Agriculture who was a former Minister for Agriculture and the two of them have put our agricultural economy into a tail spin and into utter confusion to the detriment of many people in the agricultural industry.  In addition, the Government appear not to have an agricultural plan of their own as to how to reform the CAP or how to approach the GATT negotiations.  We have a Minister for Agriculture who is seeking to pick his steps, as it were, over every minefield that his former colleague, Commissioner MacSharry, is putting in his way on the agenda for every meeting of the Council of Agricultural Ministers.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to assert their independence as a sovereign member state of the European Community and to show our people the unique contacts and new alliances that they made with their European partners during the much spoken about contribution of Deputy Leyden during our Presidency of the EC in 1990.  That was when the trouble started in relation to the reform of the CAP and the GATT negotiations.  Now we do not hear much about the contributions made by the Ministers during that time to the development of the agenda in these various reforms taking place at the moment.</P>
    <P>I hope that at the end of the negotiations in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy and the GATT negotiations that I will not be in a position to conclude that the Irish Presidency of the European Community in 1990 was nothing more than a massive public relations exercise and an opportunity for more cheese and wine receptions in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture should immediately tour European capitals to impress on other governments the unique importance of the agricultural and food industry to our economy similar to what Deputies Garret <Col N="1659" /> FitzGerald and Austin Deasy achieved during the milk super levy negotiations in the mid-1980s.  On that occasion Ireland alone succeeded in getting a 4.64 per cent increase in our milk quota while every other country in Europe was taking a 6 per cent decrease.  That is a measure of Fine Gael political clout in Europe and it was described at the time as the greatest sell out since the Treaty by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to indicate the Department of Agriculture plan on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the development of the food industry, if he has one, so that we can have a well informed debate in this House on this matter of crucial national importance to our economy.</P>
    <P>Exports of food from Ireland in 1989 amounted to £3.3 billion and accounted for a staggering 21.3 per cent of total Irish exports.  They have dramatically reduced in 1990 because the price of cattle to the farmer has gone down and this is reflected in the price of exports.  It shows once again the clear importance of agricultural exports in our overall national returns on exports.  It is clear also that the food sector is of critical importance to our economy because none of our raw materials has to be imported.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that a market-led strategy is the only way to develop an export-based internationally competitive food industry.  It is an emphasis on the marketplace that will determine the price we receive for our food produce.  The easy option of intervention is no longer available.  To improve our marketing strategy in the food industry grant aid should be given to manufacturing and distribution companies that satisfy detailed marketing criteria.</P>
    <P>All too often we see companies making market penetration at the expense of other Irish competitors manufacturing the same product.  The best example of this relates to food diversification in the co-operative movement, particularly with dairy spreads.  This has been developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion and one co-op is competing with another for a <Col N="1660" /> small share of the market.  Greater co-ordination of our export drive is essential and is desirable in the food industry. Improving food quality can be a cornerstone of this exporting drive.</P>
    <P>We have failed as a nation to capitalise on the image of Ireland as a pollution-free island and as a nation that produces pollution-free food products.  I condemn in the strongest possible language the rampant use of illegal hormones in the Irish beef industry today.  The use of hormones, such as &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; and other implants, are only a short term gain to the agricultural community and will only displace market opportunities in Europe if these illegal practices persist.  It has been proved by consumer surveys over and over again that the consumer will pay additional price for food products that are pollution-, antibiotic- and hormone-free in the interests of food safety and consumer health.</P>
    <P>A feature that has bedevilled the Irish food industry in recent times has been the lack of statutory co-ordination in respect of sampling of food for outbreaks of salmonella, listeria and so on.  It is essential to designate the National Food Centre as an independent laboratory for the uniform sampling of food rather than the existing confused and disjointed system.  It is also essential to extend this uniform sampling procedure to the European Community and establish an independent centralised agency, similar to the FDA in the United States of America, to convince European consumers on food safety.</P>
    <P>These developments are essential if we are to make further market share gains in Irish food exports and thereby give the best possible price to the producer of our food products.  The elimination of trade barriers by the end of 1992 will encourage Community food concerns to expand their geographical coverage and market leadership so that wide-scale restructuring and consolidation amongst the largest companies is likely.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to a co-operative which has made great strides and which has developed into one of the foremost national companies in the food area.  I <Col N="1661" /> am referring to Avonmore, which is in my area.  This company have devised a strategy that will bring them into the European and American marketplaces in terms of competing with similar companies in these countries.  A sum of £200 million has been spent by various food companies in Ireland over the last two years in trying to develop internationally competitive industry.  We have seen significant reductions in the number of co-operatives, with many more in the pipeline. I want to sound a note of warning. The objective of the ICOS and of the Government is to rationalise the food industry and the co-operative movement. The extension of the public limited company concept to the co-operative movement worries me slightly.</P>

      <P>Deputy Martin O'Toole has given me notice of his intention to raise the matter of coastal erosion caused by storms on 5 January last.  The Deputy has five minutes at his disposal and the Minister for the Marine five minutes to reply.  The matter is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for selecting this matter for debate this evening and I also thank the Minister for the Marine for attending.  On 5 January last the west coast was lashed by a 100-mile an hour gale when tides were at their highest &mdash; 4.5 metres on that morning.  As a result, considerable damage was caused along the coast from Kerry to Donegal.  Since this damage was caused mainly by the tides, the location of the damage is limited. We in Mayo have roughly 530 kilometers of coastline and, including the islands, something in the region of 700 miles.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to put this matter on the record because this drastic storm got very little coverage in the media.  There was a short clip on television but it went almost unnoticed.  For that reason I want to bring <Col N="1662" /> it before the House so that there will be an awareness nationally of the problems we have endured along the west coast.</P>
      <P>There is no national plan for the protection of our coastline.  The present Minister made available to Mayo County Council last year something in the region of £202,000, which was matched by the council.  This was used to take protective measures in view of damage caused by a previous storm.  Much useful work was done with that money but because we have not a national plan we have not the finances necessary to take protective measures against the recurrence of such gales in the future.  According to scientific predictions, there is no doubt there will be a recurrence, with ever rising high tides.  For that reason I ask that a national plan be put into operation as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The damage can be divided into three categories.  There is the damage caused to public services, piers, harbours, slipways, access roads, coastal roads and protection walls where county councils will have to take remedial action straightaway within their own resources.  There are also people who lost boats and gear.  In other cases houses were damaged.  I call on the Minister to examine the possibility of providing sufficient funds for remedial work and I urge him to put in place a national plan whereby we could draw down money from the European Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Toole for raising this matter in the interests of his county.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 January 1990 State funding for coast protection was transferred to my Department from the Office of Public Works.  While only a very limited amount &mdash; £150,000 &mdash; was allocated, I was successful in securing an additional £950,000 to provide 50 per cent grant aid to Wicklow County Council to undertake an emergency protection scheme at Arklow North Beach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Government approved an £8 million special storm damage package, of which £3 million was allocated to the Department of Marine to assist local <Col N="1663" /> authorities with repairs to harbours, piers and other marine damage arising from the abnormally severe storms in the winter of 1989-1990.</P>
    <P>It is important to distinguish between coast erosion and storm damage.  By no means does all storm damage arise from coastal erosion, although it is fair to say that areas subject to progressive erosion by the sea are prone to damage arising from storms.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined to this House my policy in relation to coast protection. Briefly, my Department's role is to facilitate the implementation of permanent protection schemes where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.  I do not propose to change the long-standing procedure whereby local authorities are primarily responsible for coast protection.  This includes identifying coastlines subject to erosion, dealing with day-to-day maintenance of the coastline and responding to the aftermath of occasional storms.</P>
    <P>I have already adverted to the now successfully complete major protection scheme at North Beach, Arklow.  I was glad to be able to assist Wicklow County Council with funding from my Department and the result represents a good example of the policy of facilitating the implementation of permanent coast protection schemes.  Of course, praise is due to the local authority, who showed initiative in addressing the chronic erosion problem at Arklow, by putting up 50 per cent of the cost and engaging consultants to plan and undertake the project.</P>
    <P>For 1991, I hope to make further progress with advancing capital schemes required at Bray, County Wicklow and Rosslare Strand, County Wexford, where erosion is a long-standing problem. It is important to realise that worthwhile schemes, designed to give long term relief, are generally expensive &mdash; £2 million for Arklow, an estimated £4 million for Bray and £6 million for Rosslare Strand.  Furthermore, appropriate solutions require careful study, often over a considerable period of time.</P>
    <P>As to the question of storm damage, I <Col N="1664" /> have to be straightforward and say that for 1991 no special storm damage package equivalent to that of 1990 has been made available yet.  Accordingly, my Department have no funds with which they can assist local authorities with any repairs that may be necessary following storms in early January.</P>
    <P>Storms are a recurring problem and in 1990 the position was so severe that the Government used the relatively favourable budgetary position to allocate additional funds to coastal local authorities.  I have to say that the Government are not in a position to provide such a package every time a storm hits the country.  I fully recognise that storms may create greater difficulties for some counties than others and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, will reflect that fact in his allocation to the various councils.</P>
    <P>In summary, I think I can say that the Department have made a lively response to the problem of coast erosion since 1 January 1990.  One major scheme has been completed, a number of others are in planning and necessary maintenance of existing schemes was undertaken.  On the question of storm damage, I was able to announce what was, to the best of my knowledge, the first ever special marine damage package amounting to £3 million.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deasy gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the closure of the Celtic Sea herring fishery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In good times Dunmore East at this time of the year would be a boom town.  Unfortunately, the good times are over.  Nowadays the fishermen and the onshore workers would be quite happy if they got a reasonable living for a couple of months of the year, particularly in December, January and early February.  Back in the sixties and early seventies Dunmore East was so prosperous as a result of herring fishing in <Col N="1665" /> wintertime that it could have been compared with the Klondyke during the gold rush.  There were fortunes made and fortunes spent.  Generally there was a lot of money circulating and it was a very prosperous period for one and all.  Now, in the language of the wild west, Dunmore East is like a ghost town because the herring fishery in the Celtic Sea is closed and has been closed virtually all winter.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister here tonight to make some concession to people who traditionally lived off this form of fishing so that they will have some opportunity to survive.  This is not the time of the year to fish for the white species.  Seas are rough and what is caught, particularly in small boats, has to be got inshore so the fishermen have little option; they catch herring or go on the dole.  The Dunmore herring fishery at this time of the year would normally sustain in Dunmore alone about 600 people &mdash; 200 onshore and 300 or 400 or more at sea.  The processing went on in Dunmore itself and in the surrounding areas like New Ross in County Wexford, Ring in County Waterford and even extended along the southern coast to Cobh and Castletownbere. This year as much as we have seen is two weeks fishing in the month of January. Last year and previous years we had two and a half months fishing and people are really aggrieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there is a genuine problem of conservation and a need to retain stocks at an adequate level for future years. However, I do not believe the fishery is being organised in a proper manner.  I do not believe things got so bad so quickly. I would like to see the Minister carry out a review of the way the amount of herring in the Celtic Sea is equated because I feel that a wrong picture is being drawn from the type of scientific studies being made. Not alone are we to suffer this loss commercially in the case of seagoing trawlers but even inshore fishermen who fish close to the shores in half deckers or 30 ft. boats cannot fish because of the recent prohibition order.  These people are capable of making a living from herring from two sources, the herring itself <Col N="1666" /> and the more lucrative herring roe.  That trade has built up enormously over the past seven or eight years.  It is extremely unfortunate that we have seen a curtailment to the extent we have seen this year.  It has taken £1 million out of the local economy.  The loss to the people concerned in these small towns and villages such as Dunmore East, Passage East and Tramore, can be imagined.  I would appeal to the Minister to see that the herring fishery in the Celtic Sea is organised in a better manner so that the people in each port depending on it for a living are given a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Deasy for having raised this matter so that I can explain in some detail what the situation is with regard to the fisheries in the Celtic Sea.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may recall that the closure of this fishery at end-November 1990 was the subject of an adjournment debate on 4 December last.  I availed of that opportunity to explain the problems with the management of the Celtic Sea and the ongoing difficulties faced.  I also explained how a system of local management involving all the various interests had effectively broken down and that the management arrangements for 1991 would be reviewed in consultation with the industry.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, officials of my Department met representatives of the catching and processing sectors last December to consider a fishing regime which would best meet the needs of all concerned. After considerable discussion no agreement was reached between the sectors involved.  In the absence of agreement I allocated 4,000 tonnes of the quota available to the spring fishery initially.  I increased this figure later by 50 per cent to 6,000 tonnes at the request of the fishermen and processors.  When this figure was reached I closed the fishery.  It will open in the autumn to exploit the remaining 6,950 tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Failure to close the fishery at this juncture would result in a very small quota remaining for the autumn fishery.  This would inevitably lead to an earlier closure <Col N="1667" /> than in 1990.  Deputies will be aware that there was considerable disappointment when it closed on 30 November last.</P>
    <P>A major difficulty in this fishery is that there are too many boats seeking a limited volume of fish.  The number of boats participating in the spring fishery increased substantially in 1991.  It is not possible to exploit the greater part of the quota in the spring fishery and also to have a herring quota sufficient for an autumn fishery that extends up to Christmas.  In addition, as I already mentioned there is no agreement among the processing and catching sectors on a unified approach.  In this situation I have endeavoured to strike a fair balance.</P>
    <P>The Celtic Sea fishery, which is primarily a roe fishery at present, the best roe in the world, can be divided into two distinct elements from a spawning viewpoint, one, the western half &mdash; Dingle to Cork Harbour, roughly &mdash; is an autumn fishery where the roe is suitable for commercial exploitation in the October to December period and, two, the eastern half &mdash; Cork Harbour to Dunmore East &mdash; is a winter/spring fishery where the roe is suitable for commercial exploitation in the post-December period.  Over-exploitation of either sector could have a very serious detrimental effect on the fishery and could lead to a decline or even a collapse of the fishery. This could then be followed by a long period of closure to allow the fishery to recover.  I am sure nobody wants this but we had such a closure for five years for the period 1977-82 which resulted from over-fishing.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the fishery was very successful, with good quality fish and roe, good prices, good income for the boats and good management.  The total landed value of the spring fishery was around £1 million or an average of £13,000 approximately per boat.  My objective is to allocate the available quotas as evenly as possible over the main spawning seasons. With a view to maximising income and employment both for the fishermen and the processors.</P>
    <P>I want to add a word of compliment to <Col N="1668" /> our own scientists.  Due to the research they did, we succeeded in driving the quota up to 12,950 tonnes at the council meeting, despite the fact that the Commission had scientific evidence for a much lower quota.  Thank you, A Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy Deasy, the Minister's reply terminated the debate.  I am now proceeding to item No. 3.  Deputy Bill Cotter gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the continued closure of Ballybay Meats factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am requesting the Government to take steps to have the former Ballybay Meats factory reopened for business and I further request that as a prelude to this the Government immediately restore law and order in the town.</P>
      <P>Ballybay Meats was officially opened at the end of April 1989.  It was described at the opening ceremony as, and I quote, &ldquo;a state of the art factory, the finest of its kind in Europe&rdquo;.  It had a licence to export processed pigmeat across the world.  The plant closed at the end of the first week in January 1990, some eight and a half months later and in the meantime it had accumulated substantial debts.  The Department of Agriculture and Food subsequently carried out an internal inquiry into the circumstances leading to the closure.  However, the results have never been made public and to this day the facts have never been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been rumours of fraud, shady dealing and unlawful practices. Government Ministers who must know the facts have maintained an eerie silence in this matter.  Meanwhile the town of Ballybay remains in deep recession.  The former owners and a few of their former employees are holding the town of Ballybay to ransom.  They are strutting about <Col N="1669" /> the streets intimidating those who would oppose their bullying.  These bullies are preventing access to the plant.  They maintain an unlawful guard in a caravan at the gate and recently a load of clay was dumped which completely blocked the entrance.  The bullies disclaimed complete responsibility for this, yet when the members of the local chambers of commerce tried to remove the clay a few days ago they were prevented form doing so by this same group of heavies.  This was followed by a spate of intimidating phone calls, and individual members of the chamber of commerce have been put in fear of their lives.  The people of Ballybay and the members of the chamber of commerce want the factory reopened.  They are not concerned about who does it as long as it is done.</P>
    <P>I expect the Minister will be quite horrified at what I have told him.  Indeed the people of the town and particularly the members of the chamber of commerce have reason to feel horrified by these activities.  This group of unlawful activists have decided that no one will purchase the plant except the former owners.  They have seen to it that this is widely known. The inference here, of course, is that prospective buyers should look to their own safety and get out of town.  Is it acceptable that the peace-loving people of Ballybay should have to suffer this illegal, arrogant and ugly behaviour?  Is it acceptable that employees of a security firm employed at the plant should have their persons and their cars attacked and abused?  I ask the Minister to insist that this unlawful and arrogant posturing be rooted out?  The Minister must insist that the caravan and its occupants be moved on from the gate and that the offensive placards which are on display there are removed.  He must also see to it that prospective buyers are free to enter the factory premises in the course of their business.</P>
    <P>This is a fine plant, capable of generating considerable wealth for the local community and capable of offering employment to large numbers of people. The town of Ballybay badly needs the <Col N="1670" /> jobs and the wage packets.  It is the Minister's responsibility, indeed it is the Government's corporate responsibility to root out and silence those who seek to prevent the reopening of the factory through the use of blatant intimidation and unlawful practices.  The ordinary laws of trade and commerce must be allowed to operate.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to reply to the question put down by Deputy Bill Cotter relating to Ballybay Meats.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the continued closure of this factory.  This matter has been brought to my attention also by Deputy Jim Leonard, my colleague the Minister for Health, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon and by my colleague here, the Minister for the Marine, Deputy John Wilson.  It is a grave situation, as the Deputy has outlined, particularly as this is one of the most modern plants in the business and was opened only a relatively short time ago and is part of the modernisation and rationalisation programme for the pigmeat industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, a receiver was appointed to Ballybay Meats Exports Ltd, the owners of this factory, in January of last year.  Under the Companies Act, 1963, the receiver has very extensive powers, including the disposal of all the assets of the company as he considers fit.  The question of the disposal of these assets is therefore primarily a matter for the receiver and something over which I have no direct responsibility.  Nevertheless I was very concerned about the situation at Ballybay and the Department have been keeping in close touch with the receiver on the matter.  Regarding pigmeat stocks in the factory, the receiver reached agreement with the supplying <Col N="1671" /> farmers on their retention of title claims. I understand that the sale of the stocks realised about £400,000 of which £320,000 went to the farmers.</P>
    <P>As regards disposal of the factory itself, the receiver is experiencing great difficulty in finding a buyer, even though interest was initially expressed by a number of prospective purchasers. Despite a number of efforts, which included advertising the factory for sale by tender and possible sale by private treaty, he has been unsuccessful in disposing of the plant.  I understand from the receiver that all his efforts to sell the plant are being frustrated, as Deputy Cotter said, by a campaign of intimidation and obstruction against potentially interested parties.  The receiver further states that he will not be in a position to sell the plant until this campaign of intimidation ceases and the atmosphere comes back to normal.</P>
    <P>I have got to say that I view this appalling situation with the gravest concern as I am sure do all Members of the House, particularly the Deputies representing the area.  I am as anxious as everyone else to see this plant reopened and jobs restored.  The present situation does nothing to achieve this aim and is counter-productive, and to say the least unhelpful.  I would urge all those involved to do all in their power to bring about a climate in which the sale of this plant can go ahead in a satisfactory and reasonable manner.  In this regard I look forward to the day when the plant is again operating and thereby contributing to the economic welfare of the area.</P>
    <P>On a more positive note I am pleased, to be able to report that the Government rationalisation and modernisation programme for the pigmeat industry is proceeding very satisfactorily.  A number of new slaughtering and processing plants, built to the highest EC and USDA standards are already operating.  In addition pigmeat exports have been showing steady growth and were worth over £90 million last year.  While pigmeat producer prices had been somewhat disappointing before Christmas, I am glad to see that <Col N="1672" /> there has been a pick up in prices in the past few weeks.  This, I feel is attributable in part at least to the introduction last month of an EC scheme of aid for private storage for which we had been pressing for some time.</P>

      <P>Between 1983 and 1987 Tralee Urban Council provided 275 houses.  From 1988-90 they could only provide 16 houses because of the total lack of funding from the Department of the Environment.  At present there are in excess of 168 qualified applicants waiting to be housed in Tralee.  An analysis of the circumstances of the approved applicants, carried out recently, revealed that 122 of the applicants have an income of less than £6,000 per year or less than £115 per week.  There is no way those applicants could afford to build their own houses or to pay rents of £35 to £40 per week for private accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1990 allocation of £200,000 permitted Tralee Urban Council to commence only six houses to accommodate persons on their priority list.  This small amount will not have any significant effect in reducing the waiting list.  I appeal to the Minister to approve the invitation of tenders for 24 houses at Gallowsfield and to approve the preparation of contract documents for the following schemes so that they may be commenced without delay when finances are available: seven houses at Spa Road, 30 <Col N="1673" /> houses at Upper Caherina and 12 houses at Rahoonane.</P>
    <P>The Dirha Cottages were built in 1950. The stretch of road linking the estate with Listowel town must be the most dangerous in the country.  Upwards of 250 people use this stretch of road on a daily basis, most of whom are children. Many of these people travel to Listowel on foot or by bicycle.  Most mothers have to take their children in prams in order to collect children from school.  There is scarcely sufficient room for two cars and a pedestrian to pass at one time.  Over the past 12 years along this stretch of road ten people were killed of whom six were locals, five were maimed and 56 injured. There were four hit-and-run accidents and 58 cars were damaged.</P>
    <P>Kerry County Council provided some funding over the past three years from their own resources to carry out road widening works at this location.  The Department of the Environment provided a small grant.  However, only a small stretch of the roadway has been completed and another stretch is left in an incomplete condition.</P>

In order to get a house in Limerick one has to wait and wait.  In the period 1983-87 when the Fine Gael-Labour Government were in office 500 houses were built in Limerick County Council's jurisdiction, an average of 125 houses for each year.  The average number in recent times has been about <Col N="1674" /> 25 houses, a drop of 100 houses each year.  The population has increased and more and more people are looking for houses, hence the long waiting list.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 150 families in St. Joseph's Mansions. They have to live in almost Dickensian conditions with no washing facilities whatever.  Their homes are in decay, window frames are in a state of collapse and are dangerous particularly for the many young children who live there.  The emergency services, both ambulances and fire brigade, cannot enter the complex. The one low archway entrance is too low.  This causes fear among residents for their safety in the event of a fire. Seriously ill tenants have had to be carried out of the complex by stretcher to the ambulance in the street outside.  All of this arises from shameful neglect directly resulting from the refusal of the Department of the Environment to allow Dublin Corporation carry out essential refurbishment work.  Dublin Corporation designated St. Joseph's Mansions as one of their top five priority schemes for refurbishment each year for the last three years but each year the Department of the Environment refused the corporation the necessary sanction.  This is an appalling reflection on the Minister, and on his Department.  I ask him not to pass the buck to the corporation in his reply.</P>

It will simply pump its high speed traffic back on to the streets of Sligo.  Of course, we will have a link up road from Carraroe, some time in the future.  This would be a bypass road for Sligo town.  It was rightly put into the 1989 programme submitted to Brussels but where is it now? I am afraid it has been deleted.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Lady's Hospice in Harold's Cross in south Dublin provides an excellent service and is fully funded by the State while the service provided on the north side is not so funded.  I ask the Minister to recognise this type of care and service which last year allowed 148 people to die in the care and love of their own family <Col N="1676" /> and see his way to make grants available this year of approximately £160,000 to allow this service to continue.  This is a free 24-hour service which operates in close co-operation with the local general practitioners, health nurses and so on. Many doctors have told me how valuable they find this service.  I urge the Minister of State in this his last task in this Ministry to give this funding in a caring, nondiscriminatory way for the people of the south and north Dublin and elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister to provide some funding for an organisation known as Turning Point founded in 1986 to provide a professional counselling service for bereavement, cancer patients and stress management.  This organisation charges people who can afford to pay but very often see people who cannot afford to pay.  I would remind the Minister that a similar type of service, the Clanwilliam Family Therapy Institute, receive a grant from the Department of Health of £10,000 per annum to assist in seeing medical card holders.  Perhaps he would consider using this as a precedent to give funding to Turning Point.  This service is similar to the hospice.  It prevents people from having to take very expensive beds in hospitals.  I ask the Minister to consider both issues carefully and in his last act in the Department of Health to make this funding available.</P>

      <P>Deputies Deenihan and Finucane spoke about the housing situation in Tralee and County Limerick.  I can tell them that the needs estimates submitted by all housing authorities are at present under examination and I expect to notify the authorities shortly of the allocation for their housing programmes this year. These will be determined by the relative needs and the allocation available for the <Col N="1677" /> overall programme nationally.  The total of the 1991 allocation for the local housing building programme shows an increase of 43 per cent over the 1990 provision and is double the allocation for 1989.  We are committed to dealing with the demand for local authority housing on two fronts, namely, first, maintaining the local authority housing programme at a level appropriate to the increasing need having due regard to resources and, second, going ahead quickly with the range of complimentary and innovative measures already developed as a more diverse response to social housing needs. I will be announcing full details of these measures very shortly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan knows that the road from Listowel to the Dirha Cottages is a regional road and, as I told him in reply to various parliamentary questions, responsibility for the planning, execution and financing of works on this road rests with Kerry County Council.  The local authority are free to deploy funding from within the discretionary road grants to meet the costs of such works.  Discretionary grants totalling £2.423 million and £3.193 million were allocated to Kerry County Council in 1989 and 1990 respectively.  The 1991 grants will be notified shortly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory spoke about the families in St. Joseph's Mansions who lack washing facilities.  Dublin Corporation are the housing authority for these dwellings and are responsible for their maintenance and improvement.  Under the remedial works scheme capital is made available to enable authorities to carry out major refurbishment projects to designated estates.</P>
      <P>The seven estates to which the corporation attach the highest priority have been designated for funding.  There are substantial outstanding commitments in respect of the designated projects and the overall level of demand under the scheme is very high.  Taking this into account, and given the priority ratings decided by Dublin Corporation, it has not been possible for my Department to date to designate this estate for funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can tell Deputy Nealon that I appreciate <Col N="1678" /> the desirability of completing the road from Carraroe to the new Sligo Bridge in phase with the Collooney-Sligo project and the timing of both projects will be kept under review.  The Collooney-Sligo scheme is scheduled for 1992-95 at a cost at 1989 prices of some £20 million. However, the operational programme envisages that early commencement of the second stage from Carraroe to the new bridge will depend on the availability of toll-based private investment on other roads.  Even without this investment I hope the second stage will start in 1994.</P>

      <P>First, I want to pay a special tribute to all the people working in the hospice service for the very special caring and compassionate work they do.</P>
      <P>Just over a year ago my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, allocated a grant of £100,000 from the Health allocation of the national lottery proceeds in respect of these services for the St. Francis Hospice home care team. The question of further funding for this project is being kept under constant review and will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the context of the many competing demands for the resources available to our Department.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the excellent work being done by Turning Point, one of a growing number of organisations which has emerged to provide counselling and support to people with a variety of difficulties. The Minister for Health provided a once-off grant of £10,000 to Turning Point from the national lottery to assist them with their starting up costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently the organisation were in touch with the Minister for Health arranged for officials from his Department to meet with representatives of the organisation.  It was explained to them that the question of ongoing funding for this type of service is a matter for the relevant health board, in this case the Eastern Health Board.  The organisation were advised by departmental officials to contact the health board about the <Col N="1679" /> possibility of obtaining financial support and to see if the board could be of assistance in resolving their accommodation difficulties.  The Department of Health <Col N="1680" /> have had no further contact with the organisation since that meeting.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 6 February 1990.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>Following my appointment as Minister for Justice I initiated a review of the operation of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.  I did this because I was aware that delays in the registeries, in particular the Land Registry were a source of continued complaint from members of the public and of the legal profession.</P>
      <P>I decided to commission a firm of management consultants to prepare a strategic plan for the organisation and use of information technology in the registeries. The consultants' report was presented to me within the past week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My review of the registeries further led me to the conclusion that in order to bring the services up to the standard to which the public are entitled, it would be necessary to free the registeries from the staffing and financial constraints that apply within conventional Civil Service structures.  I sought and got Government approval for the re-constitution of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds as a semi-State body.  I have set up a working group to assist me in the preparation of the legislation, to identify the cause of the problems existing in the registeries and to advise me on the best methods of tackling these problems in the context of the new body.  I shall now study the consultants proposal in detail and shall await the recommendations of <Col N="1475" /> the working group before deciding on the final shape and structure of the new body.</P>
    <P>Staff and other interest groups will be consulted in the appropriate manner in the lead up to the establishment of the semi-State body.</P>

      <P>As Deputies will be aware, An Post made a loss of £3.6 million in 1989.  The company has incurred an even greater loss in 1990.

      <P>In the context of such a plan, I recently indicated to An Post that I am prepared to approve proposals for certain increases in postal charges.  I have still to give my formal consent to the necessary statutory schemes to be made by the company.  In the circumstances and as other procedural requirements have still to be complied with, I am not now in a position to indicate the scale of the price increases.

      <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 1,000 Irish citizens in foreign jails.  It is difficult, however to estimate how many of the 1,000 would qualify for transfer to Irish prisons were the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons to be ratified by this country, given that the length of sentence of these individuals is not known and that to be eligible for transfer a prisoner has, <i>inter alia,</i> to have, normally, at least six months of his sentence left to serve or be serving an indeterminate sentence.</P>

    <P>It is estimated that about 98 per cent of our prison population are Irish citizens leaving only approximately 40 prisoners whose nationality status is unclear.

      <P>Although this was not a provision in the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, I announced during the debate that the civil legal aid scheme would be extended to allow complainants in rape cases to consult a legal aid solicitor.  I am considering the provision of additional staff to enable the Legal Aid Board to deal with this work.  The cost can be met from the board's increased grant-in-aid for 1991.  In connection with the provision in the Act for the holding in the Central Criminal Court of trials for rape offences and aggravated sexual assault, I stated during the debate on the Bill that I would keep the position about the workload of the High Court under review.  I have been in contact with the President of the High Court on this aspect and if extra resources are needed, they will be provided.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the wife and daughter-in-law of the person referred to by the Deputy arrived in the State via the Land Frontier on 17 November, 1990.  As no evidence was produced to show that either person was outside the State for at least 48 hours prior to their arrival, they did not qualify for any duty-free allowances and the beer and other goods in their personal luggage were charged with excise duty and VAT of £61.22.</P>
      <P>Following the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the 48-hour rule, the Government made it clear that, while they accepted the court's judgment, the rule would be maintained in operation pending the outcome of consultations with the EC Commission and with other member states on new arrangements giving protection against large-scale cross-Border trade distortions.  On 17 December last unanimous agreement was reached by the Council of Finance Ministers on the introduction of new arrangements by Ireland.  It is proposed to put the new provisions in place as soon as discussions can be completed with the European Commission on specific details.</P>

      <P>Under the arrangements fixed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in January 1989, the allocation of quotas to &ldquo;Mulder&rdquo; producers was limited to 60 per cent of the quantity on which they were paid the annual premium under the non-marketing schemes.  The producer named by the Deputy received a provisional allocation on this basis.</P>
      <P>The European Court of Justice has recently decided that the limiting of the quota allocations to this percentage was not valid.  The EC Commission are at present examining the implications of this court judgment.  When the examination has been completed, the Commission will submit its proposals for complying with the court ruling to the Council.  Until the final decision has been taken by the Council, it will not be possible to indicate how individual &ldquo;Mulder&rdquo; producers will be affected.</P>

      <P>Following the detection of illegal hormone growth promoters coming through parcel post from the United States, officers of the customs investigation branch and my Department investigating the matter found evidence which suggested that investigation of an officer of my Department was warranted. It was, therefore, decided to suspend the officer from duty and pay pending the investigation.</P>
      <P>The investigation to date has resulted in the seizure of a quantity of hormonal growth promoters, implant guns and empty cartridges along with a quantity of a powder which has been identified as angel dust.  Investigations by both the customs authorities and my Department are continuing.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the regulations which I introduced last July give adequate legal powers to deal with the illegal importation, sale and use of illegal growth promoting substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined that any drift towards <Col N="1508" /> the use of these substances will be counteracted and stopped.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and the other State authorities concerned will continue their vigorous campaign against the illegal use of these substances.</P>

      <P>I have, over recent weeks, received a small number of complaints about the pricing practices of certain local distributors of heating oil. These were found on investigation to be of the type outlined by the Deputy in his question, and particularly appear to have arisen in circumstances where the delivery time was unusually protracted.  Such questions, relating to contract, are matters of civil law and any disputes arising would fall to be resolved by the parties directly involved.  Consumers at any time prior to the final acceptance of delivery are entitled to inquire as to the price to be charged and to refuse delivery if not satisfied.  Having regard to the above, I see no reason to adopt the course suggested by the Deputy in relation to guidelines.</P>

    <P>My Department intend to expand the national planting programme to 30,000 hectares a year by 1993.  The development of planting is encouraged through grant schemes which are geared towards ensuring that only land which is suitable for forestry is planted.  In recognition of the importance of our peatlands, forestry grant schemes specifically exclude boglands listed for conservation by the wildlife service of the Office of Public Works as nationally and internationally important and lower rates of grant apply to <Col N="1513" /> unenclosed land which would include most heather bearing land.</P>
    <P>The Forest Service consult as necessary with the Wildlife Service, and the National Parks and Monuments Service of the Office of Public Works, local authorities and regional fisheries boards in examination of grant aid applications for forestry development so as to avoid adverse impacts on areas of scientific interest, areas of outstanding beauty, special amenity areas and sites of recognised historical, cultural or national value.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the provision of moneys for the civil legal aid scheme.  Contrary to what is said in the question, the grant to the Legal Aid Board to administer the scheme in 1991 is at its highest ever level at nearly £2.5 million.  That compares with a figure of £2.163 million in 1990 and £1.6 million in 1989.  That is an overall increase in a two year period of almost £0.9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I secured additional solicitor posts for the board and most of their administrative vacancies were filled.  Also four law centres which had been temporarily funded up to 1989 were put on a permanent basis of Exchequer funding. This year the board will be able to open three additional law centres bringing the <Col N="1518" /> total number of full time centres to 15. There will also be a corresponding increase in solicitor and administrative staffing levels.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to legal aid in criminal cases under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962 is that there has also been an increase in the moneys available from £2.75 million in 1990 to £2.95 million in 1991.</P>

      <P>Appropriate powers are available under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1990 to facilitate the preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historic interest. The Acts provide for the attachment of conditions in relation to development permissions, including conditions relating to the preservation of listed buildings and interiors but the validity of such conditions will depend on the particular circumstances of each case.  In particular, conditions must be expedient for the purposes of or in connection with the authorised development.</P>

Children with a mental handicap are also entitled to the full range of hospital in-patient and outpatient services necessary for that condition free of charge, while adults, i.e. persons over the age of 16 are entitled to the full range of hospital services if they are holders of either a medical card or a hospital services card.  The Deputy will be aware that the latter entitlement will be extended to all persons from 1 June next.</P>
      <P>GP services are only available free of charge to persons covered by a medical card.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 189 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent information available in the form requested by the Deputy is for 1988.  The following table shows an <Col N="1536" /> increase of 1,200 in the number of people being catered for in 1988 compared to 1985.</P>
    <P>The number of persons over 15 years with a moderate, severe or profound degree of handicap in residential accommodation increased from 4,164 in 1985 to 4,381 in 1988.  Information which would enable the number of disturbed mentally handicapped people or the number with multiple handicaps in residence to be identified is not available.  In addition to the foregoing, 149 residential places were provided in 1990 for all categories of mental handicap from the special budget allocation in that year.</P>
    <P>Data on the 1989 and 1990 level of service provision is being collected and will be available later this year.</P>

      <P>Records indicate that there were approximately 1,450 representations made in 1989 to the hospitals division of my Department and there were approximately 1,150 representations made in 1990.  It is estimated that one in seven of these representations were related to various aspects of hospital treatment.  It is my Department's policy to pursue all complaints with the hospital concerned and where appropriate to review the outcome with my Department's professional advisers.</P>
      <P>These figures must be seen in the context that over 500,000 patients were admitted to acute general hospitals in each of these years.</P>
      <P>As stated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a patient's charter is being developed which will include the right to make a complaint.  I am concerned that hospitals should develop effective complaints procedures. Monitoring complaints is a useful source of patient feedback and should ensure that problems are identified and remedied as appropriate.</P>

      <P>In the first instance, it is a matter for each health board to draw up plans for the development of services in their area.

      <P>The relevant Act is the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Act, 1990 (No. 30 of 1990).</P>
      <P>As was indicated in the passage of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas, the money available is being distributed among the two categories of former employees of Hospital Trust (1940) Limited generally regarded as being the most seriously disadvantaged when the company ceased operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two groups are: (1) former <Col N="1548" /> employees still living who opted for early retirement in 1978 or later and from whom an <i>ex-gratia</i> element of pension entitlement was withdrawn in 1987 and (2) former employees still living who were made redundant when the company was placed in voluntary liquidation in 1987.  Spouses of deceased persons belonging to either of the above categories will receive the amount which the deceased person would have been qualified to receive.</P>
    <P>Persons in category one above will receive a flat rate payment of £1,000.  The balance of moneys available for category one payments have been finalised and will be distributed among persons in category two on the age and service weighted basis used to calculate statutory redundancy payments.  While persons in category two have been given interim payments, I will not be in a position to indicate what the fianl amounts will be until payments in the case of category one have been finalised.</P>
    <P>I have received an application from the former employee referred to by the Deputy.

      <P>As part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> it is proposed to introduce a phased programme commencing in 1992 to expand the provision of caretaking and clerical services to all national schools with 100 pupils upwards. For this purpose schools not being provided with such services under existing arrangements, including the social employment scheme, an additional grant not exceeding £15,000 (500 pupils X £30) will be paid to schools of 500 pupils upwards with a <i>pro rata</i> provision in relation to school size for the schools in the range 100 to 499.</P>

This allocation was considered adequate to purchase sufficient equipment to allow the small number of pupils attending the Arranmore school to follow the junior certificate course to the end of the 1990-91 school year.  In the near future my Department will, in consultation with the Vocational Education Committee, assess the school's equipment requirements for the school year 1991-92.</P>
