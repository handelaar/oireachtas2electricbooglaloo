      <P>On the Order of Business, I wish to ask a question of the Taoiseach. I am aware that the Taoiseach informed his ever attentive parliamentary party yesterday that as far as is humanly possible he would bring the programme to them before 4 o'clock on Friday.  Is the Taoiseach confident that a programme will be available and perhaps be made available to the House before this debate concludes?</P>

      <P>Yesterday I sought to raise a question on the <i>sub judice</i> rule as it applies to the House.  I wish to raise a similar question today, related not to the current debate nor, indeed, to any of the inquiries that are under way but to a much more simple issue.  Deputy Byrne of The Workers' Party put a question to the Minister for Social Welfare asking the Minister to give a breakdown of his estimation of the cost to the State of £200 million due to women as a result of the Cotter/McDermott case.  The Minister has conceded the State will have to pay, but the question was ruled out of order because it related to a matter that was <i>sub judice.</i></P>

If the Deputy wants clarification or elucidation my office would be glad to assist him in the matter, but he may not challenge the Ceann Comhairle in the House in such a fashion.</P>

      <P>The Government Chief Whip circulated yesterday a list of proposed legislation to be taken in this session which included a housing Bill.  May I ask the Minister for the Environment if the proposed housing Bill will be taken in this session, and if it will provide the legal basis to enable local authorities to implement the shared ownership scheme which cannot at present be implemented?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter of major concern to the future of our country, if not to the parties which constitute what presently passes for a Government.  If we have a Dáil next week, will the Taoiseach agree to the <Col N="625" /> establishment of a foreign affairs committee, so that issues such as the latest Franco/German proposal for a European Army could at least be discussed and debated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment of the debate last evening I had been dealing with a number of issues in relation to The Workers' Party.  Over the past ten to 15 years The Workers' Party have adopted a hypocritical attitude to politics in this country.  One instance I might give is that in relation to the Peace Train, how, since the inception of the Peace Train movement, they have been in the vanguard of that movement.  Yet, if my memory serves me correctly, it was the Official IRA, their <i>alter ego</i>, who <Col N="629" /> were the first people to bomb the Dublin-Belfast rail line just north of the Border where I live.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what Deputy De Rossa had to say with regard to his links and those of his party with the Official IRA.  I can recall an incident in Newry approximately 15 years ago when a bomber from the Official IRA blew himself up trying to bomb an installation just north of the Border.  At the funeral of that gentleman the Official IRA knocked on every business door in Newry telling them to shut up shop.  Perhaps my eyesight was not great at the time but I wonder whether the man who was at the front of the cortège bore any resemblance to the former Leader of The Workers' Party.  Perhaps he did not; perhaps it was not the same person but it looked very like him.</P>
      <P>Under the leadership of Deputy John Bruton Fine Gael have been going from issue to issue.</P>

As the Taoiseach said in the course of his remarks unfortunately, they have been hopping from <Col N="630" /> issue to issue under the leadership of Deputy John Bruton.

      <P>Yes, it is a very nice one but it just shows the depths to which Fine Gael have descended, the party of the late John Kelly and of former Taoisigh, Deputies Liam Cosgrave and indeed Garret FitzGerald.  It is an agenda for a meeting &mdash; I will not quote it &mdash; but it is vindictive about an alleged Fianna Fáil connection with various scandals.  It says that &ldquo;we all know of financial advantage being taken by Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  It continues to say: &ldquo;if you have proof of such of these and believe that they may be illegal please raise them at item No. 6; our party may be able to use it to its <Col N="631" /> advantage&rdquo;.  It did not say: bring it to the attention of the Garda Síochána, so that at least it might be investigated to the national advantage.  Rather it was for the advantage of Fine Gael.  If anybody wants to see it I will produce the relevant notice. Those are the depths to which the Fine Gael Party have descended in recent years.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer briefly to what is happening north of the Border, the tit for tat murders which have been taking place which Deputy Currie quite rightly raised here this morning.  I fully suppport what he said.  Our papers have been inundated with reports on alleged scandals.  Yet, unfortunately, the constant tit for tat murders have been afforded merely a tiny paragraph by the media.  I say: &ldquo;Shame on us; shame on us on this side of the Border.&rdquo; Unfortunately there was killing on my side of the Border during the summer.  This is a matter the House is not addressing properly. If there is any party that can actually bring along nationalist opinion on this side of the Border and on the northern side of the Border in regard to any future Brooke-type talks, it is Fianna Fáil. Deputy FitzGerald acknowledged that the intergovernmental conference in 1980 was the percursor of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in keeping with the spirit which has prevailed in this House regarding the North of Ireland during the past 20 years.  I very much regret that the Deputy made those remarks.  In doing so he has let himself down badly.</P>
      <P>The reason for this debate is that this Government have lost control of the economy.  They have also lost the confidence of this House.  Certainly they have lost the confidence of some members of the Fianna Fáil Party and members of the Progressive Democrats as well.  Whether they will be able to bring themselves to vote as their conscience dictates they should or whether their feet will declare otherwise I do not know. The Irish economy is in a difficult and potentially dangerous position at a time when it faces enormous challenges both at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> Last January this Government indulged in an orgy of self-congratulation when the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was agreed.  The principle of national wage agreements is sound but in this instance the Government wanted agreement at almost any cost.  The exact scale of that cost is now becoming evident and some of the social partners are expressing lack of confidence in the Government.  They are naturally dismayed at the way the Government are reneging on agreed pay awards.  It was clear from the outset that the Government could not honour the agreed pay rises for the public sector.  There were too many variables in the equation.  The Government set out to hold Exchequer borrowing at 1.9 per cent of GNP in 1991; it has in fact increased to 2.5 per cent. The much heralded growth has not taken place and will be at best 1.5 per cent this year.  This figure has been forecast by almost every economist at the beginning of the year but it was ignored by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has stated that the Government Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1992 will be held at 1.9 per cent, or less than £500 million.  This means they will be seeking savings of £350 million to £500 million next year. Because the public sector accounts for 52 per cent of current spending on services, savings in this area are crucial to meet the target of 1.9 per cent.  This is a matter to which the Government have not referred at all.  The strain will either be taken by public sector pay or, as has happened so frequently under this Government, by the health and education services.  The position is already critical, hence we are seeking signs of industrial unrest for the first time for many years.  The position is exacerbated by other factors including the fact that over 260,000 people or 20 per cent of our workforce cannot get work.</P>
    <P>Another factor is that inflation is tending to creep up.  Although economic activity has slowed down considerably the rate of consumer price inflation has increased to 3.5 per cent, the first upward movement for ten years.  We are entering <Col N="634" /> a new phase of competitiveness as we approach the completion of the Internal Market.  The Government do not appear to be worried about the fact that the British rate of inflation has reduced considerably and the probability is that it will be down to our rate of inflation next year. Whatever advantage we had due to our low inflation rate in the British market, which still takes 35 per cent of our exports, will have vanished by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>This Government's policies have all the hallmarks of <i>ad hoc</i> planning and lack of a clear national strategy.  The lack of a national strategy has been evident in the Government's handling of two issues crucial to the Irish economy, the GATT talks and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  They have also failed to assess future developments such as European Monetary Union.  Last January I suggested that it was not too late for the Government to produce a White Paper on the question of European Monetary Union in order to examine in a systematic way the likely impact on the Irish economy.  This has not been done. There is still no paper setting out the Government's attitude.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question this morning, the Taoiseach stated that the Whips could consider having a debate before the December meeting in Maastricht.  That is totally unsatisfactory and it increases uncertainty abroad about the ability of this Government to stabilise the conditions under which business can operate. It is suggested from recent meetings in Brussels that there will be pressure to move beyond the transitional phase of European Monetary Union and that some member states want to move now. In order to proceed, the Government will have to meet strict monetary and economic targets and maintain a low rate of inflation and a stable currency, with a sustainable budget deficit.  These are impossible targets this year because of the gross mismanagement of the Government. They have not planned structures in an orderly manner.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> Recently we successfully opposed attempts to create a two-tier approach with regard to the move to the final stage of European Monetary Union. This is a matter of fundamental importance for the Community and for Ireland.  The strength of the Community lies in its ideals of unity and coherence.</P>
    <P>The Government react to events by opposing things.  We do not know what they are proposing.  They have not told this House or the public generally precisely what the position is in regard to the two intergovernmental conferences.  We have not had a debate on these matters. This adds to the lack of confidence and the uncertainty as to what will happen in the future.</P>
    <P>The question of confidence is central to this debate.  The Taoiseach has stated again and again that business flourishes in a climate of confidence.  It appears, however, that the business community have lost confidence in the Government. A poll conducted in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> with Arthur Andersen, an objective accountancy firm, showed satisfaction with the Government among business people had fallen from 71 per cent last June to 37 per cent last month.  In a period of four months, confidence had more than halved.  The report in that paper last Sunday suggested that the recent controversies and scandals are not the cause of the collapse but rather the handling of public finances.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy is facing its greatest challenge since we joined the EC and the Government are doing nothing to restore confidence and to assist the business community to gear up for the completion of the Internal Market.  Of course the current controversies, as they are euphemistically called, are adding to the concern and unease being felt in all sections of our community.  The inquiries and investigations must proceed and reports and results of these inquiries must be available for public scrutiny.  The Government must not use the fact that <Col N="636" /> these inquiries are taking place as an excuse for doing nothing about internal matters in semi-State companies.  It is because they are being negligent and inactive that the situation has got out of hand.  It is the duty of Government to set the parameters within which business and indeed the whole community should operate, and part of their task is to monitor the activities and ensure that proper standards are adhered to in all aspects of economic life.</P>
    <P>The notion of democratic accountability is central to our political system. If the people see sums of money being misused or squandered they are rightly concerned and outraged.  The so-called controversies are increasing the cynicism that is now the hallmark of the Irish electorate. We cannot afford this cynicism. The democratic process itself will begin to suffer if people become disillusioned and feel powerless to affect the system. What motivation is there for young and not so young idealistic people to enter politics if they perceive the system is ineffective, unrepresentative and unresponsive to their needs and demands?</P>
    <P>In this regard I want to say something about the Progressive Democrats who have been strangely absent either as participants or as listeners in this debate for the last two days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that they are more or less culpable than their coalition partners in Fianna Fáil.  It is because they formed a new political party in order to establish the notion of high standards in public office.  They have at times verged on the self righteous.  They set themselves up as mould breakers and political reformers.  From the smiles on faces this morning we will certainly be forgiven if we think later on today that they are not represented at the Cabinet table at all. They have attempted on a number of occasions to distance themselves from the well established principle of collective responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> There was the farcical position a month ago in Cork when Deputy Mairín Quill said they were trying to distance themselves from the job creation policies of Fianna Fáil in Government despite the fact that the leader of her own party is the Minister for Industry and Commerce who many people would consider would have the primary responsibility for creating jobs.  Deputy Quill says they should distance themselves from Fianna Fáil. Are they in or out of Government? Really Deputy Walsh, here representing the Government, should find out, because if the Progressive Democrats do not get the Government this time they will get them after Christmas on the budget.  The Government need to watch themselves.  The Government, as a unit, are collectively culpable for the disastrous state of the public finances.  The Progressive Democrats cannot shrug off their responsibility in that regard.  If, as the Progressive Democrats suggest, there are aspects of the conduct of Government that they find unacceptable, why have they continued to participate?  The obvious thing would be to pull out or to vote against the Government tomorrow night.</P>
    <P>It also seems that the current negotiations between the Government parties are nothing short of extraordinary.  In the middle of a five year period they sit down and spend four months renegotiating their position.  This is not democratic. They do not even show any urgency in the renegotiations but leave them until the very last minute.  As I stand here today there is still, as far as we know, no agreement.  However I suspect there is and that the battle between the Progressive Democrats and their conscience has resulted in their poor conscience getting another hammering and being put aside.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If these negotiations include fundamental questions such as changing the electoral system, then the situation is very serious indeed, These are matters which should have been all <Col N="638" /> thrashed out before coming into Government, not in the middle of a term of office.  To be arguing about the disastrous public spending and taxation at this time of the year shows quite clearly that the budget of last January was cobbled together for political reasons and had nothing to do with the state of the economy at that time.  A point that Deputy Bruton also made yesterday is that it reinforces our claim that the Government have no plan at all but are flying by the seat of their pants.  It is clear that there is no real commitment to any kind of long term planning necessary to reduce the national debt and create jobs for the 260,000 people who are currently unemployed. This Coalition Government seem to be based on expedience and power-seeking both within each of the parties and between the two parties rather than on any sense of the national interest.  The main characteristics of this Government are that they are operating by reacting to issues and events rather than initiating or planning strategies and policies.  They are long on aspiration but short on action.</P>
      <P>This lack of action is perhaps best and most dramatically in evidence with regard to our participation in the European Community.  With just seven weeks to go of the intergovernmental conferences in Maastricht we have no clear indication of our contribution to these conferences.  The Government have given no indication of the position on a number of key issues.  These issues include the future of decision-making structures within the European Community, the role of the European Parliament, the role of the Commission, the role of the Council of Ministers.  The Government have not addressed themselves to any of these issues and what the President of the Commission himself terms as the democratic deficit which should be of concern to every parliamentarian in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does anybody know what the Government's position is with regard to more powers for the European Parliament. What are their views on the expansion of the European Parliament?  Are we in favour of more countries coming in?  Do <Col N="639" /> we agree with the Germans that Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary should be allowed in next year?  Have the Government any views on that?  The pace as well as the scale of change requires careful analysis and study and as I have already pointed out we are unsure and unclear as to the aspect of European economic monetary union.  There has been no White Paper and no serious debate on this issue, a point that has been brought up time and time again by members of the Opposition in this House over the last two years.  This Government are not serious about Europe.  Nobody knows what they are doing.  They are waiting for something to emerge and then they make up their minds whether they are for or against it.  If they are for it they shut up and if they are against it the Taoiseach comes back in here and says we are opposed to something happening in Europe.</P>
    <P>The crucial question that has been studiously dodged by the Government is the question of Ireland's role in the common foreign and defence policy.  There is no doubt that such a policy will emerge in the next two years and perhaps much sooner if we are to judge from what the German Foreign Minister has been saying over the last few days.  The Government must not be allowed to involve us by stealth in a defence agreement. I personally would view a defence agreement within the European Community as an obligation we should undertake. However it should not be done by stealth.  It should be done by open debate in this House and not the way the Minister for Foreign Affairs attended the WUE conference three weeks ago when he appeared to agree &mdash; though it is not clear whether he did or not &mdash; that at some stage the Western European Union forces could be put at the disposal of the European Community.  This is not something we could agree to without a debate in this House.  The Minister was there like a man going into a pub for a drink who did not want to be seen having it.  All these issues must come before this House and this Parliament must decide <Col N="640" /> in favour if that is what we want to do, but it must not be done by default, because a Minister at the Council decides to keep his mouth shut and that is taken as assent. No decision on these issues can be taken without full consultation with this House.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government agreed to the setting up of an Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs.  Again he reiterated that this was the policy of the Government. Nothing happened in 12 months except one thing; he was criticised by his friend of 30 years standing who had been evidently given a promise that he would be chairman of this foreign affairs committee. However when he criticised the Taoiseach that was immediately dropped. Is that Cabinet responsibility?  This is Government by pique: a Taoiseach is annoyed because somebody criticised him and he will not therefore set up a committee on foreign affairs which is essential so that this House can understand what is going on in foreign policy at the European Community in the future.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Time and again I have listened to people here talking about 1987, as though it were the beginning of the world.  I do not know what has happened to the memories of Fianna Fáil Deputies &mdash; Eamon de Valera and Seán Lemass seem to be non-existent; 1987 seems to be the start of everything.  They have forgotten that when Deputy Garret FitzGerald became Taoiseach in 1981 &mdash; this is about the fifth time I have said this in the House &mdash; he took over from a Government who had set an inflation rate of 20.4 per cent.  What man, except a very brave one, would take over the running of a country where the inflation rate was 20.4 per cent?  Our inflation rate rose to 20.4 per cent as a result of the policies adopted by Fianna Fáil in 1987 &mdash; this is often forgotten by them &mdash; doing away with car tax and rates on houses, which bankrupt the country. That Government was led for two years by the present Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  I have listened to people talking about the inflation problem in 1987 when Fianna Fáil took office and I should like to point out to them that inflation <Col N="642" /> had been reduced from 20 per cent to 3.2 per cent at the end of 1987, which was the result of the budget introduced by Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  If this Government had to deal with an inflation rate of 20 per cent at present, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and everything else would go out the window and the Government would have to leave the country because they could not deal with the problems.</P>
      <P>During the years Fianna Fáil were in Opposition, they put up posters throughout the countryside about people queueing up for passports.  Fianna Fáil in Government have managed to take credit for controlling unemployment while ignoring the fact that people have left the country in droves.  However, unemployment is not under control and will never be brought under control. Some of my colleagues have referred to the queues for Morrison visas.  This is an indication of the confidence people have in the Government &mdash; they are letting them know with their feet that they are prepared to leave Ireland even at a time when things are not good in America.  I do not intend referring to any of the major scandals.  There is no need to refer to them as the Government have lost the confidence of the people by their lack of action.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to something which happened in my constituency.  St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, badly needs to be extended and, as is well known throughout the country, patients are being left in corridors.  In March the Taoiseach sent out the good news to the Deputy in Kilkenny.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> He referred to the correspondence from the Deputy about the Phase I development at St. Luke's Hospital.  There was a protest held outside the Dáil and the issue was raised with the health board.  I accept that it was not a personal thing and the Taoiseach is entitled to write to his Deputies but the good news was &mdash; and this spread like wildfire throughout the <Col N="643" /> Kilkenny constituency &mdash; that the major hospital development in Kilkenny would involve the provision of a maternity delivery suite, operating theatres, paediatric ward accommodation and other facilities. He also said that the building work was expected to commence in September 1991.  However, nothing has happened and the local elections have come and gone.</P>
      <P>Some people in Kilkenny saved their seats in the local elections because of this promise.  The people who work in that hospital, the caring staff who are dedicated to the patients there, as I know at first hand, are not very happy that the Taoiseach can engage in this kind of tomfoolery. I do not know why he cannot let the Minister for Health or the health board do their job and give them the money rather than leaving them in debt up to their tonsils unable to pay their bills.  This is the kind of stroke politics which has bedevilled this country and which the Taoiseach has continued to keep to the forefront.</P>
      <P>The mere mention of health brings out goose pimples on most people.  I have never forgotten the famous slogan about how health cuts affect the old, the sick and the handicapped.  That was a great slogan by Fianna Fáil when they were in Opposition, but things have only got worse since they came into office.  In 1989 the Taoiseach said he was not aware of the effects of the health cuts &mdash; and it seems the entire Government are unaware of their effects in 1991.  People contact me to see if I can get an elderly relative into hospital.  Most of these people who are over 70 years of age stood by this nation and worked hard but got very little out of it.  The treatment of these people so far as health services are concerned is shocking.</P>

        <i>(Carlow Kilkenny):</i> If the father of the House had not paid us a rare visit last night I would have been <Col N="644" /> fine.  However, that is part and parcel of life.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister listed housing as one of the achievements of the Government.  If ever a man should be ashamed to mention housing as an achievement he should be.  As any politician who meets the public knows, it is very embarrassing when a person living in very bad housing conditions asks what their chances are of getting a house.  At present, they are non-existent.  These people do not have any confidence in the Government.</P>
      <P>Since I became a Member of this House I have raised the scandal of third level grants on numerous occasions.  The Minister is still fudging this issue.  PAYE workers wonder how the children of self-employed and business people with higher incomes are able to get third level grants while their gross salary is regarded as net income and a profit factor.  I can assure the Minister that parents who have to pay for their children while the children of parents who are better off than them are not happy.</P>
      <P>Rural policing was criticised yesterday. The Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, can provide all the police cars he likes, but while they might pick up punctures they will not pick up the same amount of information as gardaí on the beat.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has been attacked for his behaviour but I think he has given a tremendous example of the work done by politicians this summer.  His speech yesterday has shown that the country will be in safe hands when he becomes Taoiseach very shortly.</P>

      <P>It has been said that history repeats itself &mdash; the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.  This confidence motion put forward by Fine Gael is a pathetic, even farcical, attempt to repeat what happened in the autumn of 1982.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil at that time were tackling the problems of the national finances, had just reached a <Col N="645" /> valuable agreement with the trade unions aimed at cutting back special pay awards and had produced <i>The Way Forward</i>, which, if implemented, would have saved us from the most prolonged recession any country in western Europe had to suffer over the next four years.  Instead, Fine Gael and Labour were determined to pre-empt any success by tabling a motion of no confidence &mdash; there is nothing wrong with that.  They subsequently won an election and took office, on the pretext of providing a Government of &mdash; I am quoting from some of their literature &mdash;&ldquo;honesty and integrity&rdquo;, a phrase which was marketed then like a soap powder. They gave us what was probably the worst and certainly least successful Government in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>Once again, the Opposition have nothing to offer in terms of policy alternatives. Instead of trying to beat or to match this Government on policy, they are once again trying to beat them by producing a wide series of so-called sensational revelations to break up the Government and to win power by default.</P>
      <P>I find the style of politics being pursued at present distasteful.  It would not be my chosen way to carry out political debate. However, Fine Gael, Labour and, above all The Workers' Party have chosen the level at which the debate is to be conducted and that is the level of debate in which they must now be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is most objectionable in this whole series of affairs is the rampant hypocrisy and the double standards.  The Fine Gael Party are particularly good at striking poses and talking about low standards in high places but they consistently choose to ignore the beam in their own eyes.  The last Fine Gael-Labour Coalition besides being a grotesquely incompetent Government did not rate very highly on the subject of public and political accountability.  At the time of the debate on Irish Shipping the then Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, was at great pains to distance himself, his Department and his officials, from any knowledge of the very questionable charter deals which led to the sinking of that <Col N="646" /> great company.  Deputy Mitchell, in spite of what he now holds, refused to appear before a Dáil committee to discuss how he had handled his affairs.  The late Deputy Cluskey asked a lot of questions at that time about the fiasco in Dublin Gas which cost roughly £100 million to the taxpayers of this country.  The scandal so infuriated Deputy Cluskey &mdash; a man of great honour &mdash; that he resigned from office.  He was not the only one to resign from office about what was going on and the low standards in high places at that time.  Mr. Colm McCarthy also resigned from the board of BGE over a scandalous deal, a disgraceful deal, a deal which was highlighted for the Irish people by the courage of Deputy Cluskey.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is a matter of coincidence, and I will be told by Fine Gael that it is a matter of no relevance, that the Chairman of Dublin Gas, Mr. Ferguson, happened at that time to be the chairman of the Fine Gael fundraising committee. When this happened, with one honourable exception, the Labour Party did nothing and said less.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is a gas man if he can sit there and say nothing about all of this.  In the course of this contribution I will outline more than one other scandal involving and implicating senior Fine Gael contacts which remain firmly brushed under the carpet.  Deputy Michael Noonan, for example, has never explained the loss of £6 million of taxpayers' money in the export credit insurance scam in Canada.  That money disappeared through fraud in 1986.  He was Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time but he has never commented on the matter in this House.  I hope he <Col N="647" /> will break his long silence and inform us now of his accountability in the issue.</P>

      <P>People talk about golden circles these days.  Fine Gael above all parties have had some friends in the business world.  AIB, for example, was bailed out with remarkable expedition from the ICI debacle and allowed to pay an unaltered dividend with indecent haste.</P>
      <P>However, I would like to come to some more recent controversies and deal specifically with them.  The commercial activities of the Irish Sugar Company over the past four years have, rightly and properly, come under the microscope following revelations about arrangements that certain executives made to reward themselves and their families at State expense.  The political connections of these people has been a matter of comment in some sectors of the media for some time.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that association with Fine Gael is a crime or that it is an offence of any kind against the law of this land but I would suggest that it is an offence, on occasions, against common sense if it is not actually a crime. Nor am I saying that Fine Gael can be reasonably blamed for every character, shady or otherwise, who is associated with them.  However, I do hold that above all else that party which have based their entire existence on what one perceptive journalist called earlier this week the mirror image of Fianna Fáil, should be the last party to decide to base their attack on this Government on the idea of guilt by association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already dealt elsewhere with another aspect of the affairs of the Sugar Company in 1986.  I refer to the report which I laid before the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies on the acquisition of a shareholding by the Sugar Company in Woodland Investment Group Limited.  On 1 May 1986 Irish Sugar acquired 140,000 shares in that company.  The Companies Office records for 1 May 1986 on Woodland Investment Group Limited make very interesting reading indeed.  I am glad Deputy Deasy has now joined us.  Among other things it shows a set of share transactions involving a private individual whom the Fine Gael members on the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies choose to identify as Mr. Brian Hussey.  In these dealings 52,181 shares were sold by that gentleman to the Sugar Company and 59,601 shares were sold to the new group. Having offloaded a total of 111,752 shares, Mr. Hussey was left with a holding of one share in the original company. We do now know how much was <Col N="649" /> paid by the then State-owned company to the relation of a serving Fine Gael Minister.  The deal has been described to me by one leading businessman not as a golden handshake but as a golden parachute. In due course, as we know, Mr. Comerford and Mr. Tully &mdash; two gentlemen whose names crop up elsewhere and, indeed, everywhere &mdash; joined the board of the new company.</P>
    <P>While we do not know how much Mr. Hussey received, we do know that the investment was far from highly regarded by either financial or accounting specialists who looked into the affairs of the Sugar Company and this is the important issue.  One of these firms of consultants operating just over a year later for the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies referred to this investment as having been &ldquo;undertaken without due consideration&rdquo; and went on to suggest that the investment be disposed of.  Within months of that report, another firm of consultants, Price Waterhouse, found that the cumulative losses on this venture at that time amounted to £750,000 and described the investment as being valued at nil.  The Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies accepted my report on this quite extraordinary affair and the matter has been referred to the inspector appointed by the High Court.</P>
    <P>There are a whole series of questions appended to that report dealing with the cost to the Sugar Company of this investment, possible payments to Sugar Company executives and possible contacts between Fine Gael Ministers.  I have no doubt that Fine Gael contributors will provide us with the details of exactly how much was paid for these shares and exactly why this investment took place.  Why, for example, did the Sugar Company which had ample space in Tuam and had a well-known and a long-standing connection with Hilleshog, the other firm involved, not get involved directly in this particular investment?  I await with interest the answer to those questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are on the issue of friends and golden circles there are aspects of the affairs of Telecom Éireann which would seem to warrant considerable and closer scrutinty than they have received to date.  I am glad Deputy S. Barrett is in the House.  Quite understandably, virtually every eye in this House and elsewhere has been focused on the Telecom Éireann site at Ballsbridge.  In nearby Clonskeagh there is another site where some interesting things have been happening.  In October, 1990, Ericssons, one of the major suppliers to Telecom Éireann occupied a newly constructed office at Richview in Clonskeagh.  The building is in the front garden of the Smurfit headquarters.  The building was constructed by a company called D-MAC, a company which Dr. Michael Smurfit claims is owned by the Smurfit pension fund.  Journalists have been unable to establish whether this is the case and the companies involved, and some of their leading personnel, have not been particularly helpful in establishing the facts.  However, we know that two shares in the company are held by Bacchantes Properties Limited, an Isle of Man company which has featured in debates here and elsewhere.  The other is held by Bacchantes Properties Limited and by a Mr. Frank Conroy.  Mr. Conroy is a very busy man.  He is, among other things, a director of Telecom Éireann. My IPA year book informs me, although it is not on his list of directorships, that he is also a director of Telecom Éireann Information Systems.  He is also a director of a number of other companies &mdash; Barrett, Hegarty, Molony Limited is one. That company will be well-known to members of the Fine Gael Party.  They and Mr. Conroy will be particularly well-known to Deputy Seán Barrett who has joined us and who is another of the partners of that company.  The interesting point about all this is that Ericssons moved to the Beechill office from offices <Col N="651" /> at the Harcourt Centre.  Their old offices did not stand idle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The old office at the Harcourt Centre did not stand idle for very long as Telecom Éireann obligingly occupied 10,000 square feet of the vacated offices and the lease was assigned to Telecom Éireann by Ericsson Limited.  All this could have just been a happy coincidence, but I think not.  The deal between Ericssons and D-MAC was negotiated by Mr. Frank Conroy.  He at that time was a director of two State bodies, TEIS and Telecom Éireann.  I wonder whether Fine Gael, who appointed Deputy Barrett's business partner to the board of Telecom Éireann in 1984, would see any conflict of interest there.  I await with interest the demands of Fine Gael to have this whole affair made the subject of another inquiry and I anticipate their ringing condemnations of conflict of interests.</P>
      <P>With regard to saying these things outside this House, I have no problem.  At least one newspaper has already specifically said these things outside this House, despite the whingeings of Deputy Barrett. The truly interesting thing about this is that the Conroy/D-MAC/Telecom triangle and all of its tortuous manifestations were fully explored by <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> two weeks ago, but a Trappist-like silence has surrounded the whole affair as far as Fine Gael are concerned.</P>
      <P>Interestingly, this is not the only property contact between the Fine Gael appointed company director in Telecom and Ericssons.  That gentleman was involved in the development of an office block at Adelaide Road, Glasthule, in Deputy Barrett's constituency in the early 1980s.  That building lay effectively idle until 1985 mainly due to the problem of getting sufficient phone lines.  The problem was resolved shortly after Mr. Conroy joined the Telecom board, no doubt a concidence, and the phones were put in place and Ericcssons moved in as tenants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like now to turn to the issue raised recently by Deputies Owen and Mitchell.  I refer to the Kinsealy pipeline.  In this, Fine Gael have been in pursuit of inherently unverifiable and implausible conjectures about the possible future implications of sewerage connections for the development of the grounds of the Taoiseach's property at Kinsealy.  What we are dealing with here is conjecture laced with innuendo.  The Taoiseach has categorically and unambiguously stated that he has no intention of seeking a rezoning of the grounds of his home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> The facts of the case have not been clearly dealt with.  The Taoiseach allowed pipes to be laid across his land to connect the Baskin Cottages.  This happened ten years ago.  The Taoiseach did not look for any form of compensation.  Recently, to prevent an outflow polluting an open stream with very limited capacity this scheme was connected to the Feltrim/ Kinsealy sewerage scheme for a cost of around £80,000.  I state that fact because it is relevant.  It is impossible to see anything against the public interest in all this.  Deputy Bruton in his characteristic fashion joined in the hue and cry.  I wonder should he have so done.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that Deputies Owen and Mitchell with their minds so concentrated on sewerage did not extend their investigations in the direction of Dunboyne, where something very much more interesting and significant has been taking place.  It is my information that land at Castle Farm, Dunboyne, belonging to members of the Bruton family, including Deputy Richard Bruton, who together with his brother Deputy John Bruton is trustee for another portion, was rezoned for residential development in May 1989.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Nearly a year later a contract was signed for the sale of almost eight acres to a developer for £55,000 an acre with an extra £1,000 &ldquo;luck money&rdquo;.  The deal also involved land belonging to a neighbour, bringing the total area involved to around 17 acres.  The original asking price had been pushed up in negotiation from £35,000 an acre.  The price caught the peak of the market.  The land was sold without planning permission but in the confident and assured expectation that there would be no difficulty getting permission.</P>
    <P>An application to build 95 houses was subsequently lodged with Meath County Council by the developer in 1990, and was refused.  The grounds of refusal were not simply the lack of sewerage treatment capacity in Dunboyne, but also that the River Tolka was much too small to take effluent.  Consequently, the development was stated not to be &ldquo;in the interests of proper planning and the development of <Col N="657" /> the area&rdquo;.  That is a matter of record. However, An Bord Pleanála upheld an appeal stipulating that no more than 50 houses should be built for the time being and the remainder when the sewerage improvements were in place.  This was against the specific advice of Meath County Council.</P>
    <P>As recently as last June Meath County Council submitted a scheme costing £560,000 to pipe sewage from Dunboyne to link with the greater Dublin scheme at Mulhuddart.  I understand that their report refers among other reasons to new developments about to take place at Castle Farm.  This matter is still with the Department and it is not clear at whose behest the county council acted on this. I am sure some Fine Gael worthy will ask, what is wrong with all this?  There may well be nothing wrong with it &mdash; so far.  However if the name on this land was Haughey and not Bruton we would be deafened by the clamour about it.</P>
    <P>There is however another interesting detail in all these issues.  While this was going on in Dunboyne the building industry was going through a very difficult period.  The builder sought a number of extensions &mdash; and got them &mdash; on the closing of the sale until he could get planning permission.  I am informed that the owners were paid £60,000 under a variety of penalty clauses for the period to May 1991 with a further £22,000 due in September last.  I am sure I will not be told if it was paid but it is claimed that the builder was asked to call these payments, in particular the £60,000 payment, &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; for tax reasons.  Penalty int erest, as the House knows well, is added to income and taxed at the full rate.  Compensation is a different matter.  The questions which have to be asked are whether this was true and would this constitute a legitimate tax avoidance ploy &mdash; a term which infuriates every PAYE taxpayer.</P>
    <P>As I understand it the contract has now fallen through.  Well over £100,000 in deposit and compensation has been paid for land which remains in the hands of the original owners which has not merely been rezoned residential but now has absolute planning permission for 50 <Col N="658" /> houses and potential for another 45.  It is worth several hundred thousand pounds and, perhaps, more when the taxpayers pay for the sewerage improvements in the Dunboyne area.  I do not wish to suggest that land owners in selling their land for housing development do anything wrong or that as land owners they are not perfectly within their rights irrespective of whether they are politicians or not to seek to use and develop their lands as they so wish within the planning laws. The tax aspects of any transaction in these matters clearly will be dealt with in due course by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>He mentioned me in regard to some company whose name I have seen in recent times.  I do not mind any examination being carried out into my role as Minister in relation to any company. I have let it be known publicly that I want to go before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  I am volunteering to do so. Contrast this with the position adopted by the Minister for Agriculture and Food who has ducked and weaved better than Barry McGuigan ever did in his attempts to avoid going before that Committee. Many matters could be cleared up if Ministers were above board, addressed the Committee and told them what they know.  We might then not need to have High Court investigations or inquiries. Obviously, the order came down from the Taoiseach to Deputy O'Kennedy not to attend, to hide and postpone everything and avoid saying anything.  In any event he would not let him attend as he was afraid he would make an idiot of himself as he has done repeatedly during the past four or five weeks.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, and to a lesser extent the Progressive Democrats, complain that there is no need to have a vote of no confidence in the Government.  The marker was put down by four Fianna Fáil Deputies two weeks ago who voted no confidence in the Government.  As Deputy David Andrews said at the time of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting, they were four brave individuals. By their actions, they voted no confidence in the Leader of the Government and the Cabinet.  There is little point in saying that we have instigated a witch hunt.  Public events in recent times clearly illustrate that the Government are unfit to continue to rule the country.  The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Seamus Brennan, in his contribution yesterday made allegations against the previous Coalition Government of Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> He referred to the PMPA, ICI and the Irish Shipping Company but there was no scandal involving any politician of that Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who owned the PMPA, the late Mr. Joe Moore, was a well-known Fianna Fáil supporter, a good friend of the Taoiseach and a big financial supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was not a State company, it was a public company, money was misappropriated and it was very badly and secretly run.  It did not impinge one iota on the Government of the day.  Indeed, the people responsible got off very lightly.</P>
      <P>The débacle of the ICI, the subsidiary of the Allied Irish Banks, had nothing to do with the State or semi-State sector; it concerned a private company and we had the job of bailing it out.  In retrospect &mdash; indeed even at the time &mdash; I was one of the people who felt that the senior management of the AIB and the ICI companies should have been brought up on criminal charges.  How dare Minister Brennan or anybody else suggest that the Government of the day had anything to do with that collapse or were at fault? The people running the company were at fault, to save the banking system the Government had to bail them out, which was our public duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to point out that the money lost in Irish Shipping was lost within the company by a middle to higher executive who spent money without reference to the board or the Minister.  No blame can be attached to anybody in Government at the time.  Again there probably should have been criminal charges. We are too soft in relation to wrongdoers and I hope, in the series of present scandals, that if there is enough evidence criminal charges will be preferred and that those concerned will not get off scot-free as happened in the case of a certain individual, a friend and associate of the Leader of the Government, who was imprisoned in Northern Ireland for a much lesser offence than he committed in <Col N="662" /> this State.  Those are the facts.  Minister Brennan, for whom I previously had some regard, should be ashamed of himself; I thought he was a decent, straightforward individual but he has shown himself to be petty, miserable and cowardly in his attack yesterday.</P>

However, the incompetence shown by the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the Greencore affair certainly is an indictment in itself.  It is a great pity that Deputy Lenihan or former President Hillery have not told us exactly what happened on the night of the telephone calls to Áras an Uachtaráin.  I wonder where the Taoiseach would be if they told us what had happened, he would not be partially covered in muck, he would be completely covered in it.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the present dire situation of agriculture and the total collapse of confidence in the agricultural sector.  That lack of confidence is largely due to the performance <Col N="663" /> of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, together with the overall performance of the Government. Their indiffrence has been scandalous. Their regard for the farming community, the workers in the ancillary industries and the business community which supply that industry, borders on the criminal; they just do not care.  There has been a collapse in prices in the cattle and sheep sectors in recent times and there has not been any remedial action by the Minister responsible.</P>
      <P>Proposals from Brussels, which, if implemented, will decimate our agricultural industry, are being treated as if they are run-of-the-mill events.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, is reported in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of last Monday in some detail following a meeting of Ministers of Trade and Industry in Holland.  He said that the position in regard to the GATT negotiations and reform of the Common Agricultural Policy was very grave indeed.  His reason for saying that was that the Germans have abandoned their position with regard to agriculture and the French have weakened their position in relation to opposing the measures proposed by Commissioner MacSharry.  If a small country like Ireland is to achieve a reasonable result in Europe it must have the backing of at least two of the major states.  To date we could rely on the support of the Germans and the French but now, apparently the German Government have made a very definite decision that they will not oppose the tough measures proposed by Commissioner MacSharry. They will endeavour to see that the proposals are pushed through and that the GATT round of negotiations is concluded by the end of this year, in other words, they are giving in to the USA lobby on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The French are not as definite as they were in this regard and it looks as if they may also agree to abandon their stance in opposition to these measures.  It is disastrous from the point of view of this country.  We will be on our own and <Col N="664" /> we do not have the clout to oppose the measures as they should be opposed. Minister O'Kennedy is not fit to carry out negotiations of this magnitude, he has shown no ability in that regard over the last four and a half years.  There is no reason to believe that there will be a transformation on the eve of the most momentous decision ever taken in regard to agriculture in this country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been seriously at fault in not touring the capitals of the EC to lobby his fellow Heads of State in regard to this issue.  When Deputy Garret FitzGerald was Taoiseach he lobbied in 1983-84 with considerable success.  These proposals, if implemented, will be much more devastating and the Taoiseach has not seen fit to have the matter debated at the meeting of Heads of State.  Apparently he referred to it when we goaded him into doing so six months ago but he has not done any lobbying.  We are particularly annoyed at his failure to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>He is afraid that there might be a coup while he is away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks as if the Government are indifferent to what is proposed in Europe, events at home are per-occupying their minds.  The whole issue has been clouded by events at home and the Government are not paying attention to events in Europe.  I do not hear any demands nowadays from the Fianna Fáil backbenchers for assistance for Irish farmers in financial difficulties. When we were in Government we devised a whole series of schemes to help people in difficulties, such as farmers are at present.  The most valuable of these schemes was the introduction of Euroloans where farmers could get money at considerably reduced rates of interest. The Government at present do not want to know about any form of relief for farmers in difficulty.  Every day farmers are going to the wall in increasing numbers. It is inconceivable that the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government have not devised a strategy <Col N="665" /> to offset the difficulties confronting the industry at the moment.</P>
      <P>This affects not only farmers but also workers in the agri-industry, the rural economy, in fact the economy as a whole. Unless some concerted action is taken by the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government, matters will get considerably worse.  Whether people wish to face up to the fact, the reform of the CAP as proposed is an integral part of the GATT negotiations.  To find out that the Germans are not prepared to go along with cuts in subsidies as high as 30 per cent is frightening; it seems they are now willing to entertain cuts which could be as high as 70 or 75 per cent.  If anything like that was to be entertained in this country, our farming sector would fall asunder and the whole economy would suffer gravely.  Farming would become a non-profitable activity, except for a few hundred very large farmers.</P>
      <P>Our markets and competitiveness in Europe are being daily eroded by decisions which should not be allowed within the framework of the EC.  How can the EC allow continued and increasing amounts of beef and milk products into the Community from Eastern Europe while there is overproduction of these commodities in the Community itself?  An agreement was reached three or four weeks ago which allows Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary to put more products into the Community, as if they had not been sending in enough already. That defies logic.  We are the principal victims of such an irrational policy and we should be compensated accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loss of our lucrative markets in the Middle East and North Africa is causing considerable difficulty for our farmers and processors.  A huge proportion of our beef was exported to Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Libya, but none of those countries appears to be open to us for the sale of beef, or if they are, it amounts to only a pittance.  They cite the BSE disease &mdash;&ldquo;mad cow&rdquo; disease &mdash; as a reason for not taking our produce but I do not believe that can be true because that disease is not a factor in this country; it is much more prevalent in other countries.  An <Col N="666" /> initiative should be taken at the highest Government level to reopen these markets. The people in these countries are particularly partial to a visit from a senior Government Minister, or better still from a Prime Minister or Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach should be prepared to go to these countries to try to salvage those markets. People may say the Iraqis cannot pay us. Of course they can; they can pay us in kind, with oil shipments.  Every effort should be made to reopen these markets, and the Taoiseach would have the clout to do so.</P>
    <P>There is a massive problem with cattle which are unsuitable for grading in factories and which would normally be shipped to Libya at this time of the year, but that market is closed at present.  The Minister in recent times has not gone to Libya in an attempt to reopen these markets.  I suggest that the Taoiseach, whose relationship with Colonel Gadaffi is well known, should go to Libya and ask Colonel Gadaffi to see to it that that market is reopened.  While he is there he could tell him that we do not want his guns or explosives for the Provisional IRA.  Let it be a dual visit.  Let the Taoiseach put it on line that we want to sell our beef at a fair price but we do not want the murder machine in Northern Ireland to be generated and sustained by Colonel Gadaffi and his aides.  That message should be made very clear.</P>
    <P>I wish to give five minutes of my time to Deputy Gerry Reynolds.  In conclusion, everything that has happened in recent times is of serious concern for the future of agriculture in this country.  The agricultural sector has no confidence in the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy.  I do not wish to be personal but that is a fact. We get the distinct impression that his ministerial colleagues have no confidence in him; it was rumoured in the press recently that they told him to keep quiet, that every time he appeared on television regarding the Greencore issue he was making a bigger ass of himself.  We need to instil confidence in the agricultural sector.  We are not getting the type of leadership the farming community deserve.  If the Minister cannot do that <Col N="667" /> job, the Taoiseach and the Government will have to take the matter in hand.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for allowing me to share his time. I often wondered why politicians are unfortunately held in such low esteem by the general public.  It is something that I, as a young person involved in politics, have thought a lot about.  I got one answer today &mdash; and that was the way Deputy Roche spoke in this House.  He was vile, nasty and sinister.  It is that sort of thing that unfortunately gives us a bad name.  Deputy Roche would have done us a favour if he had gone to the United States with his colleague who brought a bag of applications for visas and maybe they would have kept him.  However, unfortunately, he might not get through the second test which is a personality test, because what he has done here is low, vile and sinister.  His record and his advice to people in this country has caused many of the problems we are facing today, and it is the young people who have to pay in the end.  It is no wonder the Taoiseach keeps him on the backbenches.  Maybe the people of Wicklow will remove him if he carries on in that terrible and stupid manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is taking place because of the state of the nation.  The people have lost confidence in this Government. When there are more than 260,000 people unemployed it is understandable that there is cynicism and apathy.  Out of every ten people employed in this country, seven are employed in the public service and three in the private sector. There is a problem with employment creation. Whoever is in Government must give incentives to the private sector in order to increase employment.  The nearest country with similar statistics is Britain where out of every ten people employed, six are employed in the private sector and four in the public service. The Government have not tried to grapple with the problem that the system in this country does nothing to provide employment and while we allow this <Col N="668" /> system to stay in place, we will continue to have high unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and many members of the Government have had the opportunity to outline the policies they will adopt for the next two years.  The Taoiseach outlined nothing that would give confidence to the people or, indeed, to this Parliament.  That is why it is time for this Government to vacate their position, to go to the country and look for a mandate, which I have no doubt they would not get because if they cannot get agreement with their partners, how would they get the agreement of the people?  Both the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil are involved in brinkmanship and this is having a very destabilising effect on this country.  As long as that continues the kind of decisions that are very necessary to take the country out of the economic mire it is in will not be taken.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I would like to make but unfortunately I do not have the time.  There is mention of a number of people who could take over the leadership of the great Fianna Fáil Party in the not too distant future as a result of the effect of the so-called gang of four and the presence of a mortally wounded Taoiseach.  The Minister for Finance had the opportunity to show what he was made of in in terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> He said in this House that we would have an economic growth rate of up to 4 per cent but I think he was the only person who advised us of that.  I believe he knew himself that that was not possible but he did not have the gumption to take on the Taoiseach and say: &ldquo;stop, this will not be achieved.&rdquo; As a result we are left in a dire situation.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a number of points, for example, the waiting lists for health care. The Taoiseach seems to have forgotten about this.  The only time he seems to remember the health services is during election time.</P>

      <P>At the end of 1986 when the great wise Deputy Deasy was Minister for Agriculture the consumer price index showed that total farm incomes were nominally of £1,141 million. Four years later, during the period for which I had responsibility this rose to £1,689 million, a nominal increase of 48 per cent and a real increase of 31 per cent.  If I am the disastrous failure that Deputy Deasy accuses me of being, let me say that the accusations he makes against himself are very severe indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the spirit of the debate let me turn to the major issues that have to be addressed in the interests <Col N="671" /> not just of the Irish farmers but of the Irish people generally.</P>
      <P>When the Council of Agriculture Ministers resumes for a three day session in Brussels next week at stake for Ireland, and not just our farmers, will be issues of vital importance &mdash; the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals and the mandate for the agricultural element in the GATT negotiations.  I want to assure the House that my total commitment in these negotiations will be the protection of that vital interest.  I will not be distracted by any spurious smears and charges, however unfounded from discharging my constitutional responsibility during the course of those negotiations. The farmers of Ireland are entitled to nothing less.  Even before the negotiations start in Brussels next week I will have personal and important discussions in Dublin over the weekend with the Dutch President of the Council, Piet Bukman, whom I invited here to underline to him the unique importance of agriculture in the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>In 1990 agriculture accounted for about 10 per cent of GDP and 15 per cent of employment.  Its contribution to foreign earnings is of particular importance. While exports of agricultural and food products and beverages accounted for 22 per cent of total exports in 1990, it is significant that the contribution to net foreign exchange earnings, account being taken of such factors as import content, profit repatriation and receipt transfers, was of the order of 35 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the continuing importance of the agricultural sector is vital for our whole economy and not just for farmers.  The continuing economic importance of this sector is highlighted by comparisons between Ireland and other EC countries.  For the average member state, agriculture contributes about 3 per cent of GDP.  I note that Deputy Deasy is leaving.  I hope he will not engage in his usual tirade of vulgar abuse as distinct from any kind of rational analysis.  It will be seen, then, that the importance of the sector in Ireland is three times that of the Community as a whole.  For that reason <Col N="672" /> we must acknowledge that the current negotiations are the most important undertaken in the agricultural field since we joined the European Community and I can assure the House that these negotiations are being treated as such by the Government.  I am certainly treating them in that way.</P>
    <P>Our position in these historic negotiations has to be informed by the central importance of agriculture in the Irish economy.  As I have indicated, it is of greater relative importance to us than to any other country in the Community with the possible exception of Greece.  But for me, of even greater importance than the role of agriculture in the economy is its importance for people who can be forgotten in a welter of statistics.  However, the statistics I quoted for Deputy Deasy at the outset come from the Central Statistics Office and give the lie to the spurious charges that he has been spreading around since he gave up responsibility for the Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm families of Ireland and the workers in associated industries have legitimate fears and concerns at this time in the face of what is recognised as the most significant overhaul of policy in the agricultural sector since we joined the European Community. I want to put on record that it is their interests which will be formost in my mind, and nothing else, in the coming months and they need have no fear about the Government's commitment to ensuring that they will be safeguarded in the final outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to highlight the negative contribution made by some Members during the course of the former negotiations. Precisely when livestock products were being discussed &mdash; livestock products being the most important component for this country &mdash; I was made aware by my office of spurious charges being made on radio at home by Deputy Richard Bruton.  Those charges were untrue and ill-founded, and I shall come back to them.  I was called out from the <Col N="673" /> vitally important negotiations in order to provide information so that Deputy Richard Bruton could be refuted in the spurious allegations.  I shall deal with Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Deasy later.  If their purpose was to try to undermine the national interest by trying to distract me, they failed.</P>
    <P>I made it abundantly clear to this House that the Commission's proposals as presented to date are not acceptable to the Government.  Equally, the Government accept that an unreformed Common Agricultural Policy is not a realistic alternative.  However, it is imperative that the principles upon which the Common Agricultural Policy is based are not sacrificed but, through the process of adjustment, are given more effective implementation.  The Council and the Commission are in no doubt about Ireland's position on these matters.  To drive the point home, I have relied on the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy, the Treaty of Rome and the Commission's own objectives to highlight the inconsistencies between their proposals and the stated objectives of the policy, the Treaty of Rome and the Commission. I have used, and will continue to use, every opportunity both in the many bilateral contacts I have had with my fellow agriculture Ministers, with Commissioner MacSharry and in discussions in the Council to set out Ireland's difficulties and Ireland's demands.</P>
    <P>I take the view that it is only through the continuation of contacts of this nature that we can lay the foundation for the recognition of Ireland's special case and, where possible facilitate the development of an agreed approach on elements where we share interests with other member states.</P>
    <P>The central plank of our appoach to reform is that there must be balance between the legitimate expectations of our smaller producers for a fair level of income and the need to ensure that the commercial element in our agriculture, which is of crucial importance to the maintenance of a competitive and vibrant industry, is not undermined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> In addition to this general principle of our policy, I have clearly indicated to the Commission and my colleagues in the Council that as far as I am concerned there can be no progress in the negotiations unless the following preconditions at least are met.  I shall again set them out.  First, the needs of economies critically dependent on agriculture must be properly met; that is a Treaty obligation.  Secondly, the mechanisms finally agreed must effectively implement the underlying principles of the Common Agricultural Policy and involve a clear commitment to defend acceptable levels of market prices; that is a social obligation. Thirdly, adequate Community finanical resources must be guaranteed both immediately and in the longer term to underpin the policy; that is a Community obligation, because it is not open to the Commission to transfer responsibility for these financial provisions to the member states where it is a matter of Community competence.  Fourthly, adequate support must be given to ensure that the vital commercial element in our agriculture remains viable.  Fifthly, support for extensive production must take realistic account of what is required to maintain the economic basis of modern family farms.  I shall put that in practical terms.  Now that the Government have achieved what Deputy Deasy never even contemplated, the extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme to almost 75 per cent of this country, I shall not leave the table of the Council of Ministers unless I get a change in the present stocking rate proposal of 1.4 livestock units per hectare for disadvantaged areas.  Two livestock units and nothing less is what I will require before I shall move to the next stage of the negotiations.  If that is not a specific commitment then I suppose the Opposition could never expect one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is more of the old, enlightened vulgar abuse that is <Col N="675" /> stock and trade of Deputy Deasy.  Long may he remain to practise it to prove that this generation are worthy of those who gave us this privilege 70 years ago.  May he keep at it.</P>
      <P>It is also vital that the compensatory elements do not discriminate against the grass-based livestock production.  That is an essential element.  The seventh, and final point on this short list, is that any changes in the Common Agricultural Policy must be dovetailed with, and given full credit in the finalisation of the GATT negotiations.  They are crucial and central to the case.</P>
      <P>While I have clearly set down Ireland's general opposition to these proposals as currently constituted, it has to be said that there are elements that I regard as positive from Ireland's point of view.  For example, the proposed promotion programmes for the beef and dairy sectors and the proposed Community campaign to stamp out the use of growth promoting substances are especially welcome.  The proposals in the socio-structural package could also be of significant benefit to certain sectors of the agricultural community. There are other elements which could with adjustment be of much interest to us, but only if they are backed by adequate budgetary resources and assured into the future on a permanent basis.</P>
      <P>On the home front I wish to underline my commitment to a continuation of the consultation process with the agricultural interests provided for under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> My officials and I have been involved in regular contacts with the farm organisations over recent months in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These will continue &mdash; in fact, the latest took place as this debate was starting yesterday &mdash; in the difficult months ahead when it will be vital to put all of our heads together and ensure a strong and united Irish voice in the reform debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations that are now entering a delicate and decisive stage, they <Col N="676" /> are, of course, another very important element for the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.  While the Common Agricultural Policy reform process is an internal Community action, its outcome will be a major contribution in the European Community's compliance with ultimate GATT commitments.  To that extent, it is necessary to have a certain parallelism in the course of both sets of negotiations.  In this way, it should be possible to ensure that the reforms are dovetailed with the outcome of the Uruguay Round and so remain compatible with GATT commitments and allow the Community to secure credit for the reforms to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>For my part, I have maintained a strong line in the Agriculture Council to ensure that European and particularly Irish farmers are not disadvantaged by the outcome of the GATT negotiations. I will be availing of the Agriculture Council meeting next week to again stress this point and to warn the Commission against taking any initiatives in Geneva which would put at risk the essential principles of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It was during our presidency, when I was President of the Agriculture Council, that it was first agreed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers that the agriculture element in the GATT would be determined by the mandate of the Agriculture Ministers and none other. What I achieved at that stage I intend to protect at every stage of these negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to see ignorance as well as everything else being thrown around the House.</P>
      <P>Many people in the farming sector and on the Opposition benches seem to regard the GATT negotiations in an entirely negative way, yet many of those people are telling me in the context of Common Agricultural Policy reform that our international competitors must be asked to accept some disciplines as well. I fully accept the need for balance in the outcome of those negotiations, which is why I have consistently and strongly supported the concepts of rebalancing and reciprocal disciplines on the part of other trading nations.  I insist again that that will be an essential component in our demands in the GATT negotiations.  It is only in the context of multilateral negotiations that we can get our competitors to do this and the GATT negotiations provide the appropriate forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> Similarly, people seem to view the opening up of markets as a one-way street, in other words, by way of products coming into the Community.  However, given Ireland's need to export, particularly agricultural products, we need to maintain access to our current markets and to gain or increase access to markets from which we are at present excluded or to which we have limited access. Therefore, the result of failure in the Uruguay Round negotiations would be a retreat into trade blocs and a plethora of bilatreal trade disputes.  One can see this happening already in the way in which trade groups are developing such as the proposed North American free trade agreement covering the United States, Canada and Mexico.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that any GATT agreement will have its drawbacks as well as its advantages.  Through my efforts in the Agriculture Council, I have received assurances in relation to compensatory actions at European Community level which will offer a viable future to Community farmers, the continuance of Community preference and a guarantee that the total level of assistance to less-favoured regions will not be reduced as a result of the Uruguay Round negotiations. These assurances will be a big help in offsetting any disadvantages, particularly since over 70 per cent of our country now falls into the less-favoured category.</P>
    <P>Agriculture and rural development are also vital components of the overall economy in Northern Ireland.  That is a matter very dear to my party and, I believe, to every Member of this House.  It is a matter in which I have had a firm and constant involvement since I entered politics 26 years ago.  The natural features of Ireland are not changed by the Border. For that reason I have been ever conscious in all my negotiations of the need to co-ordinate policy positions in the interests of all farmers, North and South, and have consulted regularly with my British colleague to advance this common interest.  Recently I was in Belfast with <Col N="679" /> the Under-Secretary of State for Agriculture to ensure that, with common purpose, we can advance the common interests of Irish farmers, North and South, hopefully breaking down one more barrier of suspicion and hatred all too much a characteristic of that sad part of our country at this stage.</P>
    <P>Whatever the outcome of negotiations one thing is clear &mdash; the days of over-reliance on commodity trading and market support mechanisms must be brought to an end in Ireland.  The key to maintaining the future viability of our agriculture lies in our ability to adopt a much more market-driven approach to agricultural production.  I should like to assure all involved in the agricultural sector and those dependent on it that Government will continue to give top priority to a market-driven strategy based on quality assurance and the highest attainable standards.  For that reason since I became Minister &mdash; and I might add that Deputy Deasy would not recognise the controls that now obtain; they are so much better and stringent than those that obtained in his time &mdash; I have put in place a whole range of additional controls to strengthen the normal controls that have been in place in my Department for many years.</P>
    <P>The Department's control system, like any other policing system, is capable of being breached, of course it is, particularly if avaricious people are determined to breach it and set about doing so systematically. What matters is that that control system is reviewed periodically to check for possible weaknesses that emerge from changing circumstances.  It is also important that that system be reviewed after each known breach to identify what action needs to be taken to prevent similar recurrences.  Both periodic review and review after a breach has occurred are now standard practice in my Department.</P>
    <P>In the light of the last periodic review I effected two changes of major significance &mdash; Deputy Deasy, please note. The first was the establishment towards <Col N="680" /> the end of last year of a separate intervention unit in my Department.  That move brought together for the first time all the European Community intervention functions which, prior to that, had been located in the various commodity divisions of the Department.  The benefits from tighter, more uniform procedures across the board, have been considerable.</P>
    <P>The second change to which I refer was the establishment, again at the end of last year, of a control inquiry group which has power to dispatch control inquiry teams to carry out unannounced, on-the-spot, inspections from headquarters of meat and dairy plants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <P>I recognise that the very complexity of the regulatory system is a factor that renders effective control more difficult. My Department are currently working, in parallel with similar efforts at EC level, on the simplification of documentation and procedures for intervention control. Of course, such further changes in the control system as may be indicated by the current investigations will be effected.  I give the people my solemn commitment in this House that that will be done.</P>

    <P>The abuse of veterinary medicines is a new problem in Irish agriculture.  It is practised by an unrepresentative, reckless minority and runs the risk of doing enormous damage to our meat export <Col N="681" /> industry.  Over the past two years I have introduced a range of regulatory controls and I will be bringing proposals before this House to apply considerably increased penalties for offenders.  Specific inspection procedures at farm and factory level have been put into operation already.  The role of the Garda in this area has been expanded.  Particular attention has been devoted to cutting off the supply sources of these products.  We have had very considerable success in that connection recently.  It is my belief we have made substantial progress in clamping down on these abuses but I am not saying, in this or in any other area, that there will not be outbreaks of individual, shameful breaches of the regulations.</P>

Let me put on the record that I have not the statutory power to intervene but if, as a consequence of all we inquire into, it seems that that power should be given to the Minister, let me assure this House and the people generally, I will take it.  If that is the reason Deputy De Rossa said yesterday that I should resign &mdash; because, as the Deputy himself put it so well, even when I have nothing about which to be guilty it would seem that I have &mdash; let me say to Deputy De Rossa and those beside him that it is in sharp contrast with him and his lot because he and they have the capacity &mdash; when they have a lot about which to be guilty &mdash; to give the impression that they are the guardians of all that is good, holy and moral.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food has demonstrated the accuracy of Deputy De Rossa's description of him yesterday when he said that in a mediocre Cabinet he is head and shoulders below the rest.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey, during the weakest, least convincing, most evasive and ambivalent speech I have heard him make in the House decided to single me out for a vicious personal attack and to ascribe to The Workers' Party the orchestration of the campaign of scandals that now besets his Coalition Government. The Taoiseach's bizarre reasoning was followed by the spectacle of his political bully boy, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke, trawling a BBC television programme to find a convenient peg on which to hang an old list of allegations against The Workers' Party.  It would appear that the Government have decided that by digging up what they claim as The Workers' Party past we will be intimidated from exposing Fianna Fáil's present.  The tactics used for so long by the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, to silence his own backbenchers will not silence members of this party.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday:</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has played a leading role in the more pernicious aspects of the campaign.  He has been the RTE anchorman appearing daily with some new false allegation or innuendo.</P>
      <P>I challenge the Taoiseach to enumerate these so-called false allegations or innuendo. I stand over every comment I have made during this political crisis.  If I had time I would repeat every question I have posed because the Taoiseach has left the important questions unanswered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> Indeed, I intend to pose a few questions to the Taoiseach and his Government today.  Of course, the Taoiseach does not really believe that I have been making false allegations.  As Deputy Michael D. Higgins pointed out in an important contribution yesterday, the real message is in the sub-text.  The Taoiseach is really saying to RTE &mdash; get Deputy Rabbitte off the airwaves because I do not like what he is saying.  Not for the first time his colourful Man Friday, the Government press secretary, will no doubt communicate his master's wishes even more directly to RTE management.  This is the ugly authoritarian face of intolerance described so graphically by his own courageous backbencher, Deputy Seán Power.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to say that my political agenda &ldquo;seems to be one of furtive phone calls, clandestine meetings with some disaffected, disloyal employees, passing over stolen documents&rdquo;. How does the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, know about my &ldquo;furtive phone calls&rdquo;?  Is it a case of the leopard not being able to change his spots? Are some of his old friends back to their old ways, listening in to private phone calls?  If the Taoiseach is getting an accurate transcript he must know that even in the golden circle in which he moves, the public spirited people who have spoken to me over recent weeks can hardly be described as disaffected employees.  Many of them are business people who are sickened by the manner in which normal business and commerce have been distorted by political favouritism.  It is more revealing that the Taoiseach's kitchen cabinet should consider such public spirited people to be disloyal.  Disloyal to whom?  Disloyal to the public interests, to the taxpayer, to the image and reputation and future of our country, or disloyal to the small elite who have made huge fortunes from inside knowledge and boast in the better restaurants of their off-shore mechanisms to avoid tax?  Is the Taoiseach saying that he would prefer to leave public life &mdash; as he is now surely destined to do &mdash; keeping this information swept under the kind of carpets <Col N="686" /> that his charming Man Friday will hopefully soon revert to selling?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach complained that I had put down a series of questions to him demanding to know if he has had meetings with various different people.  He seemed entirely unconscious of the irony that all my questions have been transferred to one or other Minister, which defeats the very purpose of these questions. In any event at the rate the various Ministers are steering clear of any questions that lead to the Taoiseach's door, there is no prospect of answers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech yesterday does nothing to allay the public disgust that is so manifest about the operation of a golden circle where some elements of business and some elements in politics are hand in glove.  It is all a pernicious rumour orchestrated by The Workers' Party, according to the Taoiseach's creative scriptwriters.  &ldquo;I was not involved in the Carysfort deal,&rdquo; he tells the House, and then adds: &ldquo;I gave it my full support&rdquo;. What precisely does this mean? Who is the more grateful to the Taoiseach for his &ldquo;full support&rdquo;&mdash; the taxpayer or Pino Harris?  The taxpayer must welcome the opportunity to learn about &ldquo;mezzanine finance&rdquo;, &ldquo;positive tax opinions&rdquo; and how to make investments without really knowing them in the new Smurfit business school.  The Taoiseach noted:</P>
    <P>In the last few days we have much play being made of what was on the face of it an extraordinary letter written by Mr. Desmond to the Chairman of Pernod-Ricard.  The claims it seemed to make are patently absurd.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying from a man who apparently never admits anything that the Taoiseach agrees that the letter is &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; but on what basis can he conclude in his next sentence that &ldquo;the claims it seemed to make are patently absurd&rdquo;? How can the Taoiseach tell this House with a straight face that if there was any impropriety it would have become evident in the court proceedings?  The court reached its findings on the facts before it and since Mr. Desmond's letter was not <Col N="687" /> before the court, nobody can say what the court would have found.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach avoids the earlier confusion about whether he considers Mr. Desmond a &ldquo;personal&rdquo; or a &ldquo;business&rdquo; friend and chooses to put on the record of the House his full support for what he describes as &ldquo;a great national enterprise involving thousands of fine people who were up-front, open and above board&rdquo;. This reference to the Whitbread Round the World yacht race is a curious insertion in the Taoiseach's speech.  Nobody asked the Taoiseach to make any &ldquo;apologies for fully supporting it&rdquo;.  However, since he raises the matter and since he is so adamant on his lack of contact with the commercial State companies, may I ask him to tell the House what precisely his full support for this great &ldquo;national enterprise&rdquo; entailed?  Did he bring pressure to bear, or have representations been made on his behalf to the State companies to support this &ldquo;great national enterprise&rdquo;?  In particular I invite the Taoiseach to deny that he personally canvassed Irish Life for a donation of £100,000 to this proud endeavour.</P>
    <P>Continuing what the Taoiseach and his Ministers would have us believe is the doctrine of separation of State from semi-States, I would like to ask the Taoiseach to reconcile the statement by Mr. Smurfit that he was requested to bring in consultants to prepare Telecom Éireann for privatisation with the Government's own statement that no such request had been made.  I put it to the Taoiseach now that Mr. Smurfit indicated that he was prepared to take a further term as chairman of Telecom Éireann only if he could be assured that the company would be privatised. The Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, personally, at the same time that he was telling the Congress of Trade Unions the exact opposite, assured Mr. Smurfit that that authorisation would be forthcoming.  Hence Mr. Smurfit's action in getting on with the job and Mr. Brennan's inability to disclaim Government involvement.  Mr. Smurfit's personal interest in the design of a new headquarters for Telecom in Ballsbridge was <Col N="688" /> not because of any short term profits that might accrue with or without his knowledge to any of his investment companies but because of his intention to take a significant and a controlling interest in a privatised Telecom.</P>
    <P>Before publication of the Desmond/ Pernod Ricard letter by Deputy De Rossa, the single most disturbing allegation of an extraordinary series of allegations was the revelation by Deputy Bruton that sensitive financial data secured in confidence about the commercial affairs of a subsidiary of Aer Lingus was transmitted to a rival company in the private sector of which the Taoiseach's son is a principal.  The Taoiseach made no reference to this matter which has so disturbed so many of his own backbenchers.  He has transferred my questions on the matter to the Minister for Communications, Deputy Séamus Brennan, who has distinguished himself so far in this controversy by managing to avoid what he believes is the truth of what happened.</P>
    <P>May I now put it to the Taoiseach that no postal misdelivery every occurred? May I put it to him that the financial and related data spoken about by Deputy Bruton did indeed actually reach Celtic Helicopters, and may I ask him to explain to the House why we are now getting a different version of events from that given to the Aer Lingus board at the time?  Can I invite him to explain to the House the significance of last week's <i>Sunday Business Post</i> front page story that the principal in the company, Mr. Ciaran Haughey, was at the time a consultant for Ryanair?</P>
    <P>I had also hoped to have time to ask the Taoiseach in some detail about the summons he issued to Mr. Bernie Cahill in the summer of 1990 to visit his island retreat to instruct him there to discontinue the services of Goodbody's stockbrokers in favour of Mr. Desmond's NCB for the upcoming flotation of Irish Sugar.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach insinuated yesterday that I and Deputy De Rossa met with the Chief of Staff of the IRA apparently to secure information to discredit the <Col N="689" /> Government.  It is a base lie and the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey and his bullyboy Minister for Justice know it is a lie.  It is a lie that stands excised from the record of the House but was widely broadcast since.</P>
    <P>I share the same county and similar humble origins with the Taoiseach, but other than that there is more than a generation dividing us.  The Taoiseach has carved out a number of distinctions which have so far eluded me.  I have missed out on the great wealth that has somehow fallen into his lap during his time in public life.  His career has also been marked by the distinction of having been charged with the illegal importation of arms.  That is not a distinction that I covet.  Last night in an outrageous attempt to divert attention, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke, sought to rely on the contents of a television programme against which libel actions have been initiated and in respect of which the principal source of allegations against The Workers' Party has since been remanded and charged with conspiracy to murder members of the security forces in the name of the provisional movement. These facts did not suit the purposes of the Minister in his frenzied scavenging to intimidate The Workers' Party Deputies.</P>
    <P>There is no secret about the origins of The Workers' Party.  One dimension of our history is rooted in the militant nationalist tradition.  More than 20 years ago our antecedents recognised the futility of physical force.  The progenitors of The Workers' Party did make mistakes in the circumstances then prevailing in Northern Ireland, and what seems to be upsetting Minister Burke and some of his backwoodsmen is that these mistakes have been acknowledged by The Workers' Party and that we have left behind the blind alley of militant nationalism and entered the arena of democratic politics.  Unlike Fianna Fáil which has its own origins, The Workers' Party Deputies did not enter this House with revolvers in their pockets.  Of course it would suit the purposes of Fianna Fáil if The Workers' Party supporters were <Col N="690" /> still painting letter boxes green or shooting at members of the security forces rather than making such a political nuisance of themselves in this House.  The viciousness and sheer malice of the attacks on the Workers' Party by the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey and Minister Burke must be some kind of barometer of the impact we are making on this Government.  Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister likes being pursued for answers and I can scarcely think of two Members in this House less suited to engaging in a witch-hunt against anyone.</P>
    <P>What can the House expect from a Minister for Justice whose previous role has been in his own words, to act as the protector, enforcer and provider of and for the speculators?  With unconscious irony he tells the House that he has initiated the first comprehensive review in recent years of the Garda Fraud Squad.  Minister Burke is uniquely qualified to know how badly such a review is needed in the fraud squad.  He has an extent of personal experience of the fraud squad which none of his predecessors can claim.  Having secured his auctioneer's licence almost contemporaneous with his election to Dublin County Council, Minister Burke's subsequent activities are to some extent a matter of public record and eventually became the subject of a fraud squad investigation.  One wonders if the country would have been so fortunate in its Minister for Justice if the system of appointment in the US, for example, of Senate hearings for senior Government appointments applied.  The prospect of being able to question the Minister, for example, on the contents of Frank McDonald's book <i>Saving the City</i> is certainly an appealing one.  In the book Frank McDonald stated about Deputy Burke:</P>
    <P>As an auctioneer he was an agent for the hundreds of houses they built in the Swords area.  As a councillor he tabled motions to have agricultural land which they had bought rezoned for development, immeasurably increasing its value.  An extract from one of the Brennan and McGowan <Col N="691" /> companies published by the newspapers showed that he received the sum of £15,000 in fees under the heading &ldquo;planning&rdquo; in relation to the sale of 35 acres of newly zoned industrial land at Montgorry near Swords. Another Brennan and McGowan company built his house, &ldquo;Briargate&rdquo; on its own grounds off the Malahide Road.  It was designed by the group's principal architect, John P. Keenan, who was later appointed as a member of An Bord Pleanála by Mr. Burke on his last day in Office as Minister for the Environment in June 1981.  Mr. Burke insisted that there was no connection between the motion he seconded to rezone the Montgorry lands for industry and the £15,000 payment.  He told the <i>Sunday Independent</i> that the sale of the land to which the payment was linked had not gone through.</P>
    <P>I happen to have got a copy of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in question of 23 June 1974 which includes a photograph of our present Minister for Justice under the heading &ldquo;Conflict of Interests on Council&rdquo;. Deputy Burke is in a nice position as the Minister for Justice of this State and he is in a nice position to berate me or any of my colleagues in this House. This is Minister Burke's background, and when he is opening files and scavenging for dirt perhaps he would read again the unfortunate Joe McAnthony's article of June 1974.</P>
    <P>I have a good deal of additional information but time is rapidly running out. However I want to say this.  It is a bit difficult to listen to a lecture on morality from Minister Burke who, for much of his political career, acted as the enforcer, protector and provider for land speculators. The fact that Deputy Burke was appointed Minister for Justice says a lot about the Taoiseach's choice of friends and assessment of character.  Gasps of disbelief went around the fraud squad in Harcourt Square when that Cabinet appointment was made in 1989 and they discovered that their new political master was to be a man who himself had been <Col N="692" /> the subject of an intensive fraud squad inquiry arising from his activities as an auctioneer and politician in North Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke clearly believes that the events which occurred in 1971 and 1972 are legitimate matters to raise in this debate.  If he can cast his mind back that far again perhaps he would cast it back to one year earlier.  He demanded answers from The Workers' Party.  Perhaps he should also ask some questions relating to the illegal plot to import arms in 1970. I should like to ask the Taoiseach if it is true that it is a condition for any journalist seeking an interview with him that no questions relating to the arms plot may be raised?  Why has the Taoiseach never commented on the suggestions made by Mr. Justice Henchy in his summing up at the arms trial that either Deputy Haughey or Deputy Gibbons had committed perjury?  Who did the Taoiseach meet at that time?  Did he meet with people who where then leading members of the IRA?  What was his knowledge of the circumstances of the establishment of the Provisional IRA?  Why has the Taoiseach never commented on the statement made in the Dáil on 1 December 1972 by his former cabinet colleague, Deputy Blaney who said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Not only did circumstances bring the freedom fighters into existence but so did the promised support of help, not just by me but by a lot of other people as well.  The blame lies on me and a whole lot of others, who helped to bring into existence shortly after those who are now condemned as terrorists, murderers &mdash; the gunmen of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>That is a brief excerpt of the response I should like to make to the scurrilous assaults on my party by the Taoiseach and Deputy Burke.  To ask us to vote confidence in a Government which is led by one and has the other as Minister for Justice is to ask too much of us.</P>

All those allegations were made on RTE and as far as I know they were never refuted.  They should refute those allegations while they are at it.  I am sure it would be appropriate for them to refute those allegations in another forum, on radio or television.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased, as Minister for Trade and Marketing, to have this opportunity to speak in support of the motion before the House.  Before dealing with my specific area of responsibility, namely Ireland's marketing and export performance in recent years and the prospects for the future, it is worth reiterating some facts about the performance of this Government and its predecessor since 1987.  I will also deal with how the marketing and export promotion policy of both Governments has played a vital role in the recovery which has taken place in the economy since 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil came to power in 1987 we found the country in the most perilous state.  The national debt had been doubled over the term of office of the previous Government.  The budget deficit at over 8 per cent of GNP was at the highest level ever.  Income taxes were at a level where many considered it not worth their while to earn an income. Investment in the economy was non-existent. Employment had fallen by over 60,000 during the previous Government's reign.  Confidence was at an all time low. <Col N="698" /> Indeed, it would probably be truer to say that despair was at an all-time high. This was the mess the incoming Government were faced with in 1987.  To many it appeared a hopeless case.</P>
    <P>Immediately on taking power in 1987 we set about rectifying this disastrous situation.  We faced up to the tough decisions which had to be taken.  I must place on record the responsible attitude of Deputy Dukes and the Fine Gael Party at the time.  Unfortunately, he suffered the consequences of his responsibility when he was removed and replaced by Deputy Bruton as Leader of the party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>What were the Minister's crowd doing over there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, the record will show that Deputy Dukes played a very important role in supporting the policies pursued by our Government at that time; many of us suffered electorally in 1989 as a result of the action taken in the national interest.  We were prepared to stand up and make very tough decisions.  We should place on record our appreciation to the person who was Taoiseach then, is Taoiseach now and the Taoiseach of the future, for his commitment and dedication to this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>By 1990 the despair which had existed had been changed to a new confidence.  This confidence was well founded.  The basic economic indicators showed just how successful this Government and the previous one had been in the transformation of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current budget deficit had been cut from the record level of 8.3 per cent of GNP to just 2 per cent by 1990.  The economy had been transformed from one of stagnation to positive growth averaging 4.5 per cent per annum.  The balance of payments moved into surplus aided by record export levels and trade surpluses and Ireland became an attractive location for investment.  We have one of the lowest inflation rates in world. <Col N="699" /> Personal tax rates fell from 58 per cent to 52 per cent at the higher band and the standard rate fell from 35 per cent to 29 per cent, a major achievement in a short number of years.  We built a strong economy which was crucial to weather the effects of the latest severe international recession; a recession which of course has impacted on us just as it has on even the world's strongest economies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to turn now to my own area of responsibility, namely, trade and marketing and more specifically export performance.  Since 1987, this Government and their predecessor can be justly proud of their record in promoting Irish exports.  We have had continuing trade surpluses every year. Overall export growth and the export performance of our indigenous exporters have been most impressive even in the face of extremely harsh worldwide economic conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish export performance has still been most impressive in 1991, despite the level of international recession, war in the Gulf and general economic uncertainty.  Up to the end of July, exports showed a remarkably solid performance.  Exports in value terms for the first seven months of the year amounted to £8.6 billion, almost at parity with their 1990 levels. This performance is characterised by steady growth in the indigenous sectors such as textiles, furniture, clothing and footwear.  However, the international <Col N="700" /> recession has had a particularly adverse affect on exports of computer related equipment with exports in this sector down by some 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>The real success of exports for the first half of 1991 lies in the volume increase, with overseas sales of manufactured goods up to 7.6 per cent over the same period last year.  When one considers that this volume increase was achieved against a disimproving world trading climate, the export performance so far this year is to be commended.  Even though downward price pressures in the international marketplace are causing our export values to be static, given the strong volume growth which we are experiencing, I am confident that 1991 will see an increase in export values from £14.3 billion last year to at least £14.8 billion in 1991, truly a great performance for our country, truly a great performance for the Government, truly a great performance for our manufacturers and our exporters.</P>
    <P>Of particular importance is the success of our indigenous exporters.  Preliminary surveys by An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; the Irish Trade Board &mdash; indicate that their 1,200 indigenous companies are showing particularly strong growth in their exports in 1991.  The sectors performing best are clothing, footwear, textiles and added value food products.  This performance continues a trend which can be traced back to 1987.  Over the three years from 1987 to 1990, indigenous exports increased by 44 per cent in value while total exports increased by 33 per cent. Before 1987, indigenous export growth had consistently trailed that of overall exports with an average annual growth of just 5 per cent.  Since 1987, indigenous exports have outpaced overall export growth at an average of 13 per cent growth per annum.</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective of all trade and marketing policy is employment creation. I am confident that the efforts made to develop the marketing capabilities of our firms is now bearing fruit and will continue to do so.  I would like to give a practical example of a company which has benefited from yet another <Col N="701" /> Government inspired scheme to assist exports, namely the special trading house scheme.</P>
    <P>In a letter to my office recently, a manufacturer explained how his company increased production through the use of a trading house to do his overseas marketing.  Prior to dealing with the trading house, export sales for the company were zero.  After making arrangements with the trading house, exports now account for 80 per cent of sales.  Employment in the company has increased from 13 to 48 people.  This is an example of how export led growth can impact on employment and how crucial exports are to our economy overall.  We will continue to develop policies which produce results such as these.</P>
    <P>In the midst of all these Government efforts and the individual efforts of firms we must never ignore the extent to which our destinies are controlled by outside factors.  There is no point in pretending that we are immune from economic conditions which prevail in the rest of the world.  The economies of our major trading partners have experienced severe recession.  Although some are showing signs of re-emerging, many are still clouded by enormous difficulties.  In the US, for example, the weakness of the banking system is still affecting confidence; efforts by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are being hindered by old technology, the lack of an infrastructure to support a market economy and lack of entrepreneurial spirit.  A recent estimate by UNCTAD predicts that aggregate world growth is likely to advance by less than 1 per cent in 1991 compared with almost 2 per cent in 1990.  The difficulties of trading in a tight economic situation such as this with intensified competition as firms compete for market share must always be recognised.</P>
    <P>There are two factors in particular which have contributed to our export success in the past and which will undoubtedly continue to contribute in the future. The first is the Government's achievement in creating a favourable business environment which I have already outlined. The second element concerns the <Col N="702" /> specific supports which the Government put in place for our exporters over those years to help them build market share. The efficiency and effectiveness of these supports are continuously under review and are adjusted to suit the particular demands of our exporters from time to time.  What length of time remains for me?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like now to concentrate on the substantial efforts which went into developing marketing programmes to assist Irish business prepare for the threats and opportunities of the Single European Market.</P>
      <P>There has been general agreement in this country that, historically, too high a proportion of State expenditure on industrial development has gone towards investment in equipment and fixed assets. It is acknowledged that the balance needed to be shifted towards &ldquo;softer assets&rdquo; and particularly towards areas of perceived weakness like marketing, management development and technology. This policy was adopted in the White Paper on Industry Policy in 1984 and the two reviews of that policy which have been published, the last one in December 1990, bear out that a significant shift within the industry budget from support of fixed assets to non-fixed assets has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are quite confident we can meet the challenges and the opportunities which will present themselves in the Single Market.  Indeed the Government during the Presidency of the EC in the first six months of 1990 played a very significant role in ensuring we had much greater opportunities in the Single European Market after 1992.  Generally speaking this debate which is taking place is certainly unhelpful to the economic wellbeing of our country.  It is in the national interest that Ministers, Ministers <Col N="703" /> of State and Members of this House should assist the business community in every way possible to develop markets and increase production.  I make no apologies for working with industries throughout the country to assist them in developing and in increasing employment. Nothing said in this debate will deter me from my responsibility as a Minister.  I will work with companies in my constituency and beyond to obtain new markets at home and abroad.  In pursuit of that I will be delighted to continue my contacts at all levels.</P>
    <P>As a Member of this House I am concerned about media coverage of events over the last few weeks.  I favour, without question, a free media, subject only to the prevailing laws of libel and whatever constraints the Dáil may decide to impose in relation, for instance, to incitement to hatred or violence.  In fact, one of the distinguishing features of free societies is a media which is free to report and comment on all the issues.  The media has a big contribution to make to the maintenace of democracy and, of course, one of the hall-marks of an anti-democratic society is a media which is muzzled.</P>
    <P>That said, I would like to take a look at another quality which the media must possess &mdash; a sense of responsibility.  As far as I am concerned, freedom and responsibility go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>Because the media business is so competitive, it is natural that each newspaper or radio station or whatever should try to make its product as attractive as possible. Sometimes, this may result in over-simplification of complex issues, but it is to be expected that the media will try to make these issues as stimulating and attractive as possible, without distorting the facts.  There has to be a middle way and, usually, the media get it right.</P>
    <P>However, in recent weeks, I have been disappointed to see a lowering of standards in some of the media in the headlong pursuit of better and more sensational stories.  Some media people have lost sight of certain things which are essential if they are to carry out their jobs in a professional and objective manner. <Col N="704" /> A particularly worrying development has been the presumption of guilt by association which has crept into some coverage.</P>
    <P>We should all be very grateful to a vigilant media which exposes and reports on corruption wherever it exists. I do not want dirt to be swept under the carpet.  People and institutions, up to the highest level, should be subject to scrutiny and, if they do not measure up, we should know about it.  In uncovering stories which, at the very least, raise genuine concerns, the media performs a very useful task and is to be complimented. However, not all coverage in recent weeks has been fair and reasonable and some of it has crossed that line into the presumption of guilt, or certainly, leading the reader/listener/viewer to think that some person or organisation is guilty, in advance of any proven facts, particularly, guilty by association.</P>
    <P>Also, calling for some sense of national responsibility on the media's part is not unreasonable.  The media is part of Irish society and should think carefully about damage which it can inflict on the national economy.</P>
    <P>For instance, it might be very tempting to run a sensationalised story on a particular industry, which, by creating seeds of doubt about that industry could lead to lost export orders and, ultimately, lost jobs.  That is why I am deeply concerned about coverage in recent weeks.  There is an onus on the media not to rush prematurely into print with such a story; it should be thoroughly checked out beforehand.</P>
    <P>I know that, by saying this, there will be those who will accuse me of calling for a whitewash approach to journalism, that is that anything, true or false, which damages the country's image should not be made public.  I am emphatically not saying that.</P>
    <P>If something or somebody deserves to be exposed, so be it.  We do not want companies for instance who damage our efforts to establish a quality image for Irish industry and its exports.</P>
    <P>However, when there are rumours and unsupported allegations circulating, it is up to media editors to think very carefully <Col N="705" /> about the presentation of a story before running it.  They should give consideration to the potential for causing commercial damage to a company or an industry or, indeed, to the national image.</P>
    <P>It is about time that the media established a press council to ensure that those who would be affected by unproved stories have some remedy without going to the courts.  I particularly resented articles by Conor Cruise O'Brien in the <i>Irish Independent</i> which were most offensive to the Taoiseach.  The allegations were scurrilous.  Dr. Cruise O'Brien talked about people gathering at the crossroads waiting for the grave to be dug and about someone waiting to plunge the knife or the spear into the Taoiseach.  That was incitement to hatred by a vicious commentator, a former Member of this House.  It reached the lowest standards of any newspaper or publication here. The editor and the proprietors of the <i>Irish Independent</i> should ensure that that type of approach is not repeated.  It is an embarrassment and it is an insult to the elected leader of this country.  I very much resent that sort of publication and I appeal to the media to set up a self regulatory press council so that people will have a chance to at least put their case.  That would do the media a good deal of good.</P>

      <P>This motion gives Members the opportunity to put to the test the activities of the Government composed of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in terms of their ability to do the job they were elected to do. It also gives politicians the opportunity to avail of a verbal blood letting and a political blood letting to release the pent up fury and outrage felt by many people reflected in the words of politicians as a <Col N="706" /> result of various activities of the Government.</P>
      <P>There are other people in the country who should now have the courage to speak out.  There are still loose ends to be tied up with regard to many of the allegations and activities with which the Government are concerned.  Arising from discussions yesterday and this morning a deal will probably be cobbled together by Friday and the Taoiseach will not be forced to seek a dissolution of the House.  The fact that that will happen indicates the shortsightedness of the Government in their collective responsibility in that the decision to carry on merely reflects their stumbling from crisis to crisis.</P>
      <P>We will go on from this crisis to the preparation of the budgetary estimates and the attempt to implement the budget next January or February with all the consequent difficulties for any Government. Those difficulties coupled with attempts by Fianna Fáil members to change leadership mid-stream arising from a naked fear of going into a general election with Deputy Haughey as leader adds to the difficulties, the lack of confidence, the cynicism and the frustration of thousands of people.  I am surprised that the matter of collective responsibility is not to the forefront in this debate.  I have not heard a member of the Progressive Democrats express confidence in the activities of the Government or talk about the responsibility placed upon them by the electorate.  They appear to be unable to defend the confidence motion and their Government in terms of what they have done.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his speech yesterday said that under the national development plan there had been sustained investment in our infrastructure, roads, ports and airports with corresponding benefit to activity in the construction industry.  The Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Coalition Government have let this House, our young people, the middle aged and the elderly down.  As one person quite rightly put it: the only difference between this place and the Titanic is that it had a band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> The economic crucifixion and wreckage which have been brought about by the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in Government are obvious to everyone on the streets of Ireland.  The CII report on unemployment indicates that at the end of August 265,300 people or 20.4 per cent of the labour force were out of work. This represents an increase of 35,000 since the same period last year despite the fact that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in their concluding remarks on the national plan said there was no question ever again of allowing Government expenditure to increase as a proportion of GNP.  We have seen nothing but abject failures since the introduction of the fraudulent budget by the Minister for Finance earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The national debt hangs around the neck of each man, woman and child in this country.  Not alone has the country borrowed in dollars and Deutsche Marks but it has deprived young children in over crowded classrooms of opportunities to avail of the right type of education which would enable them to cope with the difficulties they will face in their lives.  It has forced those who have left our much esteemed education system with qualifications to go abroad to find employment and gain experience.  Elderly people who wake up each morning crippled with pain must wait for hip replacement and orthopaedic operations because of the inability of the Government to provide a decent health service.  Thousands of people are deprived of the opportunity to gain some comfort in the remaining years of their lives.</P>
    <P>It is for those reasons principally that I wish to speak to this motion of confidence as a Deputy representing the west which has been cast aside completely by the Government.  No matter what happens now or what temporary arrangements are arrived at there is nothing which will restore the confidence of the people in the Government's ability to run their affairs.  The Government have lost that confidence and they cannot regain <Col N="708" /> it.  The soldiers may well march on but I wonder where their destiny lies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the amazing side issues to this motion of confidence in the Government is the reluctance of the junior partner in Government to participate in the debate.  Indeed, they are threatening to withhold support for a Government in which they have participated for the past two years and four months.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this debate is not to gaze into a crystal ball to see what this Government will do in the future but rather to measure their performance during the past two years and four months.  It is clear that the Progressive Democrats, four Fianna Fáil back benchers and the Opposition parties in this House do not have confidence in the Government.  Judas like behaviour is apparent in the activities of the Progressive Democrats.  Even though collective responsibility has been vested in the nation's interest in the Government two Cabinet Ministers are withholding their confidence while negotiations are taking place.</P>
      <P>On this side of the House we do not have confidence in the Government because of what they presided over in the past.  The Government should be alarmed about the fact that not only has this House lost confidence in them but that the public have.  All the barometers and indicators used to measure the performance of the Government point to abysmal failure.  Emigration reached record levels during the term of office of the Government.  Unemployment has reached its highest level in the history of the State, the public finances are in disarray while farmers are fearful for their future.  The scandals of recent weeks have only crystalised what was already a high level of dissatisfaction with the performance of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is unfortunate is that the level of apathy and cynicism among the public towards politics and politicians has increased and they no longer tend to distinguish between those politicians who behave in a correct and honourable <Col N="709" /> manner and those who callously disregard procedures and long accepted standards in public life.  It is for that reason that I put down a clear marker that not all politicians are the same.  If they were, we would not need to have this debate as we would all be in agreement and applauding ourselves for presiding over record levels of unemployment and emigration, for the fact that the public finances are in disarray and that all the other indicators point to an inadequate Government performance.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are not a party of strokers and dealers.  They have a proud record in administration.  One of the interesting things which emerged from the recent scandals was that the CII considered it necessary to implement a code of conduct and lay down procedures to be followed in the business world.  However, the Government do not seem to have learned any lessons or recognise that the time is now opportune to introduce a code of ethics and standards to be followed by politicians in discharging their duties.  The public will draw their own conclusions from the Government's failure to announce that it is their intention to introduce a code of ethics.</P>
    <P>There has been too much emphasis in the debate so far on the scandals of recent weeks.  I do not need to base my arguments on those issues but I should like to refer to one of them, the Telecom Éireann affair.  The following point is indicative of the creeping bureaucracy and centralisation evident during the term of office of the Government.  Why did Telecom Éireann who have the most technologically advanced communications system in the world consider it necessary to purchase a headquarters in the hub of the capital city given that EEXCO, the financial exchange company based in Killorglin, can compete with the best financial exchange companies in the world from that location? How come Telecom Éireann saw fit to pay in excess of £9 million for a site on which to build their headquarters in Ballsbridge?  That scandal has not been <Col N="710" /> tackled or commented upon by any commentator. One could buy a serviced green field site in any rural town, build an office block which would meet the requirements of Telecom Éireann, and operate with a very advanced telecommunications system a very efficient headquarters for the price they paid for the Ballsbridge site.  That did not happen and it is evidence of the creeping centralisation and bureaucracy which pervades every element of the Government and decision makers at national level at present.  I want to move on from that but it was the one point that really got my back up in regard to the scandal.</P>
    <P>So many other things happened that the scandals really only crystallised the level of dissatisfaction with the Government. I want to dwell on four points.  I want to refer to unemployment because many of the people with whom I went to school and college are now eking out a living in London, America and Australia, indeed in the four corners of the earth.  I am not saying that Fine Gael have all the answers to the problem of unemployment. However, when this party made an offer to depoliticise the whole unemployment issue, to take it out of the realm of point scoring on the backs of our emigrants, the Government refused to entertain that suggestion, to their eternal shame.</P>
    <P>The unemployment crisis is the single gravest issue confronting this country.  I saw &ldquo;Newstime&rdquo; on RTE a week or ten days ago at the height of the clamouring by our young people for Morrison visas. The programme came from Galway and I was struck by a girl with a law degree seeking an apprenticeship.  She had spent two years in employment other than the field in which she was qualified and she had now had enough.  It behoves all of us to put the political point scoring on the unemployment issue on the back burner. The Government should no longer close the doors on all Members of this House who want to contribute in a meaningful way to resolving the problem.</P>
    <P>The second point with which I should like to deal is the whole area of agriculture. It is very relevant in the context <Col N="711" /> of unemployment because the Government seem to fail to realise the potential in the agricultural industry to contribute to a significant reduction in our unemployment levels.  I come from the Cork North West constituency which is a microcosm of life in rural Ireland.  It is largely an agricultural community with a PAYE workforce, much of which is a spin-off directly from agriculture, including food processing, and the service industry, which are also dependent on agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is an appalling lack of confidence among the agricultural community regarding their future.  The Government's failure to respond in any meaningful manner to the Common Agricultural Policy reforms proposed by Commissioner MacSharry has alarmed them.  When you consider that 16,000 jobs are estimated to be lost in the PAYE sector alone as a result of the Common Agricultural Policy reforms, one can appreciate the level of despair which exists.  We have not presented any alternatives to Common Agricultural Policy reform and if we are to be taken seriously at European level we cannot be merely reactionary at that forum, we must come up with viable alternatives.  That we have not done so is to the eternal shame of the Minister for Agriculture and Food who has spent the last six months in the bunker avoiding the public gaze and refusing to answer questions in relation to where he stands on a number of important issues which at present afflict the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>ERAD, the great white hope for TB eradication, is in disarray.  The level of grant payments to farmers is nothing short of criminal.  I had occasion to contact the Department of Agriculture and Food in Cavan recently about installation aid payments, I was told that 25 would be paid between now and Christmas but that they could not give any assurance that any would be paid in 1992, which is an appalling statement.</P>
    <P>The third point with which I wish to deal is the attitude of the country and the Government to the EC in general.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> Ireland's future is intransically bound up with the EC; we have gained immeasurably from our membership.  Fianna Fáil's attitude to EC membership is inconsistent and reactionary.  Cast your mind back to the Single European Act which paved the way for many of the benefits we have received since it was passed and which Fianna Fáil opposed in Opposition. When the going got tough Commissioner MacSharry, when he was an MEP, advocated that perhaps Ireland should reconsider its membership.  If there was a time when our citizens questioned whether membership of the EC was beneficial it was when Commissioner MacSharry announced his reform proposals for the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>There is no long term vision in relation to EC membership from the Government, there is no public awareness about the importance of the EC to our economy, simply because the Government have not led the debate.  A whole series of important issues are now coming to the fore in Europe, including monetary and political union.  The Government will go to Maastricht in December and will not present an Irish standpoint on any of these issues.  They will merely react to the proposals of other Governments for our future.  Surely, if we had our interests at heart, we should be in there presenting our vision of a new Europe rather than merely reacting to other peoples opinions as to how a new Europe should develop?</P>
    <P>My final point is in relation to the whole question of Dáil reform.  The Progressive Democrats raised public expectations like no other party had ever done in the formation of the Programme for Government in regard to their vision of Dáil reform.  However, to date, there has not been any Dáil reform under the Government.  There are 166 Deputies in this Chamber, 95 per cent of whom, because of the way the structures of parliament operate, are nothing more than glorified messenger boys for their constituents. The present system alienates the vast majority of TDs from making any meaningful contribution towards a resolution of all the problems which <Col N="713" /> afflict this country.  There is a cosy Cabinet club which assumes a monopoly of wisdom on all our problems.  Is it any wonder that we are in a quagmire with all the problems of unemployment, emigration and public finances?  This is because 14 wise men assume this monopoly of wisdom and exclude from any meaningful contribution the rest of the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>We need a proper committee system. There are proposals reported in today's newspapers from France and Germany regarding a European army.  We do not have a foreign affairs committee where we could discuss that matter and take a stand on it If we had a good committee system we could reduce the level of bickering in this Chamber because much of the common ground would have been previously ascertained and only matters of dispute would emerge on the floor of this House.  At present everything is in dispute in the House because there is no forum where areas of common ground can be determined.  It is very regrettable that we do not have a committee system for debating budgetary provisions as they are adopted without consideration of their implications after one question is put and one vote taken.  It is an appalling system when you consider the amount of money involved and the difficulties in collecting it.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has further diminished contributions which elected Members can make to policies in a meaningful manner.  All decisions are now taken by the Government in consultation with the social partners.  The process of consultation with the social partners is good but it is not a substitute for real parliamentary democracy where all the Members in this Chamber would be involved.  It is another indication of the contempt with which this Government treat this Chamber.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset I have four points on which I wish to comment with regard to the confidence motion in this House.</P>

      <P>I have been involved in politics for a long time &mdash; I have been a Member of this House for 18 years &mdash; but I have never heard more dishonest and unpatriotic propaganda than emanated from the Opposition in the past few weeks.  They may feel that it will enhance their position in the polls, and that they may move up a point or two as a result, but the constructive approach just taken by Deputy Creed would be far more advantageous to Fine Gael, as was the Tallaght strategy, than the type of campaign that has been waged in the past few weeks.  It is destructive not only to the country at large but also in a very personal way to Members of the House and to politicians in general.  It is doing no service to the country or to the Opposition. I have never heard such sanctimonious propaganda as came from The <Col N="715" /> Workers' Party in the last few weeks.

It is very improper for anybody in the privileged position of this House to make the kind of unprecedented attacks that have been made in recent times.  The financial position of The Workers' Party and the fact that they are sacking their own employees does not give much confidence to the people that they would be able to manage the affairs of the country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil took office a couple of years ago this country was on the brink of financial collapse.  It was in an economic morass and there was no prospect under the Coalition Government in office at the time that the position would ever change.  It is well known that there was widespread disagreement in that Coalition Government for almost a year and a half before that Government were finally dissolved.  We saw the spectacle of members of the Government walking up and down Leinster Lawn while some issue of Government dragged on for two or three days.  The Government could not come to grips with the issues because there was no inherent stability in the Coalition arrangement at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we hear public attacks on the present state of the country we must look at the position as it is at present.  This and the previous Government have a record of courage and leadership.  They are probably the two best Governments since the foundation of the State.  We have inflation rates and our balance of payments under control.  There have been <Col N="717" /> some difficulties in the financial area and we are endeavouring to deal with them effectively, although it is not easy.  In spite of that, we now find that when the Opposition have no complaint about the economic performance of the Government a performance that was supported for quite a long time by Deputy Dukes with his Tallaght strategy, and, which was welcomed by the community at large &mdash; when they cannot find a reason to attack policies and issues that affect us, they resort to the tactics of singling out individual Ministers, and the Taoiseach in particular for attack.  The sustained and vindictive campaign of vilification has raged unabated for months.  I know what that is like because I put up with it for nearly a year and a half when a personalised campaign of vilification was waged against me, with 3 a.m. phone calls of intimidation.</P>
    <P>We have a job to do here and we have a responsibility to the people who elected us to see this job through.  The constituents who are watching very carefully what is going on will be able to gauge whether their interests are best served in having people of courage and leadership who are prepared to tackle the economic problems or people who will yield to every pressure that comes their way.  In my case the constituents of Clare realised that a campaign was being waged against me, and I would not be here today were it not for the fact that they voted confidence in me.  That was a most vicious personalised campaign and it lasted for nearly two years.</P>
    <P>As I said, we have to deal with the present economic position in an effective manner.  It is vitally important for the economic success of the nation that a firm grip of the economic affairs of State be maintained by the Government.  To do otherwise would be to put back the development of this country for ten to 15 years.  We must put aside all the talk and comment about scandals and the vilification of personalities and get down to the basic task on hand.  The Government need the support of the Opposition in dealing effectively with the very serious economic problems facing us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> I want to mention some important aspects of the Department of Defence. Since taking up office in February last it has been my prime concern to ensure that despite the economic constraints within which we must all operate, the Defence Forces should have the resources to undertake their various tasks in aid of the civil power at home and to continue to support in a practical way the ideals of the United Nations and the peace keeping missions we are involved in overseas.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most significant development in relation to the Defence Forces was the publication of the Gleeson report which set out in a clear way the policy framework for the future development of the Defence Forces for a number of years.</P>
    <P>This year's Defence Vote makes provision for substantial increases in pay and allowances for members of the Permanent Defence Forces awarded by the Government following consideration of the recommendations of the Gleeson Commission.  Since January 1989 the average pay of Defence Forces personnel, including military service allowance but excluding other allowances, has increased by approximately 29 per cent while the average pay of officers has increased by 22 per cent.  In all the report of the Gleeson Commission contained 170 recommendations in regard to a wide range of areas from adjustment of allowances to organisation, management and personnel policy generally in the Defence Forces.  Most of the recommendations in relation to pay have been implemented.  Other recommendations many of which are complex, relate, for example, to organisation, manpower and personnel policy.  Certain conditions of service and superannuation are being considered at present.  The time scale for their implementation is dependent on a process of consultation especially in co-operation with the elected representatives of the military personnel. We have set up committees and we are in discussion with the representative <Col N="719" /> associations and personnel to bring about these most desirable changes.</P>
    <P>One of the major recommendations of the Gleeson Commission was in the area of representation for Permanent Defence Forces personnel, officers and other ranks.  I was very glad earlier this year to establish in a formal way organisations representative of the Permanent Defence Forces for officers and other ranks.  We have also had some very full and constructive discussion with the members of the reserve forces, the FCA and Slua Muiri.  We believe it is possible to put in place a permanent association which will represent members of the Reserve Defence Forces so that we can have worthwhile and constructive dialogue to ensure we provide a better all round service.</P>
    <P>In the present climate it is regrettable that we should be obliged to commit substantial scarce resources in the area of aid to the civil power.  However, the Government recognise that the maintenance of law and order and the preservation of our democratic institutions are of paramount importance and are vital to the economic advancement of the State.  The Government, therefore, will continue to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately provided for so that they may continue to afford whatever assistance is needed to ensure our citizens can go on with their daily lives in peace and security.</P>
    <P>We remain firmly committed to the peacekeeping effort overseas.  The Government remain fully committed to supporting United Nations peacekeeping missions.  In addition to making significant contributions to the cause of international peace by supplying personnel to missions in the Lebanon, Cyprus, the Middle East, Afghanistan-Pakistan and Central America over the years, early this year we responded to further requests to supply personnel for a new United Nations observer mission in Iraq-Kuwait, in Angola and in Western Sahara.  In all we have a total of 840 personnel serving overseas.  All of the requests for help impose considerable strains on our resources.  Nevertheless, the <Col N="720" /> Government feel that practical support must be given to the United Nations in so far as we can.  As Deputies are aware all military personnel involved volunteer to serve overseas and I wish to place on record my own and the Government's continuing appreciation of the vital contribution to world peace made by the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity to visit the United Nations' peacekeeping mission in the Lebanon earlier this year and I was impressed most of all by the numerous representatives of the communities in the Lebanon who expressed on behalf of the people of the Lebanon their deep appreciation to the Irish people for the magnificent support they are getting in their difficult times.  Thousands of people have died there over the past ten or 15 years in an area the size of County Tipperary. They value and appreciate the skill, dedication and, above all, the diplomacy of the Irish personnel serving overseas who have brought credit to this nation.  This puts Ireland into the forefront of the nations of the world today who have been contributing in a positive and real way to the maintainance of peace and tranquility in many of the troubled areas across the world.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised about European security.  It has been the policy of successive administrations for Ireland to play its part internationally in efforts to promote international peace and promote disarmament and arms control.  We have played a full and practical role in the United Nations peacekeeping measures. We have participated in the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which has helped improve East-West relations culminating in the signing of the Paris Charter.  In reply to a parliamentary question the Taoiseach indicated to the House on 17 April our position on the matter as reported at column 87 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>If in the fullness of time the European Community brought forward its own defence arrangement, it would naturally be our position that we would <Col N="721" /> favourably consider taking part in such an arrangement.  That was my position a long time ago and it has not changed; I believe that would be the position of most parties in this House.  If the Community were to develop its own defence arrangement for its own security then we, in Ireland, would certainly consider participating in that.  Nothing has changed in that regard.</P>
    <P>That sets out clearly our commitment in that regard.</P>
    <P>At home we have embarked on an accelerated programme particularly in the search and rescue service.  A cause of concern to many Members was the absence of adequate search and rescue facilities, especially on the west coast. Important developments have taken place in the area of search and rescue services.  An Air Corps Dauphin helicopter was deployed to Shannon in 1989. A contract for a new search and rescue service has now been put in place in Shannon and the Dauphin helicopter has been deployed to Finner, County Donegal, thus increasing the service in the northwest. It is planned to relocate a second Dauphin helicopter in Cork which will operate with the LE Eithne and provide a very effective search and rescue service. I wish to avail of this opportunity to compliment all those involved in that service. It is a very dangerous and at times hazardous occupation.  We are glad to have people in the service who have the skill and ability to provide that service which has been an outstanding success.  It has been demonstrated clearly that in all kinds of weather conditions whether day or night an effective service can be put in place.  That is a credit to the members who operate that service.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been put in place for fishery protection.  I do not have time to go into this in detail but information on our fisheries surveillance service is contained in my script.  We now have a fully manned fisheries surveillance service which has proved very successful in the control especially of foreign illegal boats in our territorial areas.  This will be more than important especially in view <Col N="722" /> of the fact that Community policies have been revised.  We are likely to get additional resources from the realignment of the Common Fisheries Policy.  It is vital that we have an effective fisheries surveillance protection service working to ensure that we preserve a vital national interest, our fisheries.</P>
    <P>As well as that, we have been constantly revising our information technology and investing a sizeable amount into that area.  With a budget this year of about £368 million or £370 million and a payroll of almost 14,500 personnel including some civilian employees, it is essential to have a major reorganisation of the whole information technology service which could lead to modernisation of our service and enable us to have a better hand in the management of the Department's affairs and the service generally. The first phase, which is almost completed, will give better control over our financing, management and service generally.  A fairly large investment has been made in that regard.</P>
    <P>Following on the policy of advancement of women in the Defence Forces, this year for the first time we have recruited women into the FCA.  Two hundred places in the FCA have been set aside for women, and it is hoped to expand that number further during the remainder of this year.  As well, of course, we have for the first time ever provided for female apprenticeships in both the Air Corps and the Army apprentice schools.  Some cadetships will also be reserved for women this year.  We have a progressive and forward policy for the advancement of women in every section of the Defence Forces to provide for increased participation by women in the Defence Forces generally.</P>
    <P>The Government can generally boast of a successful record in identifying the vital issues affecting the country and in adopting effective policies to address those issues.  By contrast, the Opposition parties have been collectively ineffective even in their commentaries on the major issues.  Opposition Deputies have been bereft of ideas and have resorted to inept and feeble attempts at criticism of the <Col N="723" /> Government's handling of matters.  In relation to my own Department if the Government were to go ahead and implement demands coming mainly from Opposition spokespeople on Defence then there would be additional expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds. Opposition Deputies had no regard whatsoever to the costing of their demands or to where the extra money would come from.  It is fine to adopt such an attitude while in Opposition, but the Government live in the real world, and if demands are to be met then they have to be paid for.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and other Ministers have outlined the difficult economic circumstances that the Government are confronting head on.  Many of these circumstances are outside the control and the influence of the Government.  One has only to consider some of the effects of the Gulf crisis earlier this year to realise that not only did that crisis create economic difficulties for us, it also created economic difficulties in the United Kingdom, in the United States and across the whole international business arena. While we had a very bad time for the first quarter of this year, all the indications are that the position has stabilised.  The recession that was biting especially hard in the United Kingdom, affecting us here in a very real way, and also in the United States, resulting in a huge fall-off in the number of visitors from the United States, created certain difficulties that were not anticipated earlier this year but we have to contend with them.</P>
    <P>One of the most objectionable features of the recent controversies has been the headlong rush to condemn with no regard to the consequences either at the personal level or in relation to the best interests of the country, at home or abroad.  Outrageous statements have been made in the past few weeks, and they have been made without any reasonable basis.  In my view, the real motivation for those statements seems to be an attempt to undermine the Government &mdash; blatant political opportunism has been the order of the day.  It has been nauseating to put up with that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> I am glad that in the past few minutes the House has observed the realisation of the younger Fine Gael Deputies that the carry-on in which they have been engaged in the past few weeks is not going down well with the general public who will not tolerate it.  Those Deputies are beginning to see that their best way forward would be to adopt the constructive stance taken by Deputy Creed, who spoke just before me.  That will be a welcome change.  At present the House needs constructive opposition, not destructive comments and personal snide remarks that do not really affect the day-to-day management of the affairs of this country.  From the financial point of view, this country has not been in a better state in the past ten or 20 years than it is now.</P>
    <P>The basic fabric of the economy is sound.  The prospects for the success of the Irish economy in the next few years are very good.  What the Government need to do is to tackle effectively some of our basic underlying problems We need the co-operation of all sides of the House to do that.  If there is a sign of change in Fine Gael now, it is a welcome sign and one that I hope will continue.</P>

      <P>Ní féidir le páirtí ar bith sa Teach seo a dhearbhú go bhfuil muinín aige sa Rialtas.  Tá sé thar a bheith soiléir gur amhlaidh an cás do gach ceann de pháirtithe an Fhreasúra.  Tá__an scéal ceannann céanna ag páirtithe an Rialtais féin.  Is beag muiníne atá ag cúlbhinseoirí Fhianna Fáil sa Rialtas.  Chonacamar agus chualamar uile trácht ar an gcruinniú a bhí ag an bpáirtí sin an tseachtain seo caite.  Deallraíonn sé gur cruinniú achrannach a bhí ann, agus gur nochtaíodh go leor leor mí-shásaimh, ní hamháin leis an dTaoiseach ach, lena hais sin, le seasamh an Rialtais, le gníomhaíocht na nAirí, agus leis an easaontas poiblí atá ann idir páirtithe an Rialtais &mdash; easaontas atá ag borradh, ag fás agus ag éirí níos nimhní lá i ndiaidh lae.  Cloisimid go bhfuil cúlbhinseoirí Fhianna Fáil anois ag smaoineamh ar choinníolacha a chur ar a dtacaíocht don Rialtas sar a dtugann siad a gcuid vótaí amárach.  B'fhéidir go <Col N="725" /> bhfuil ceacht á fhoghlaim acu óna n-iargcáirde sa Pháirtí Daonlathach.</P>
      <P>Céard faoin bPáirtí Daonlathach?  Tá sé rí-shoiléir nach bhfuil muinín ag an bpáirtí sin sa Rialtas, ainneoin go bhfuil beirt Aire dá chuid sa Rialtas, agus Aire Stáit lena cois sin.  Dá mba rud é go raibh muinín dá laghad ag Teachtaí agus Seanadóirí an pháirtí sin sa Rialtas conas a mhíneoidís na sraitheanna ráiteas á n-eisiú ag an gcathaoirleach ar deoraíocht atá ag an bpáirtí sin agus na ráitis a thagann amach ón bhFeisire i bPárlaimint na hEorpa acu agus na ráitis a eisítear lá i ndiaidh lae ag na Seanadóirí acu.</P>
      <P>Ní féidir a shéanadh go bhfuil baill an pháirtí sin san Oireachtas agus in údaráis áitiúla anseo is ansiúd faoin dtír ag déanamh a seacht ndícheall chun a chur i gcéill nach bhfuil aon bhaint acu, maith nó olc, beag nó mór, leis an Rialtas.  Tá siad ag iarraidh a ligean orthu nach bhfuil siad páirteach sa Rialtas, nach bhfuil siad freagrach as a bhfuil á dhéanamh ag an Rialtas.  Bíonn siad ag cnáimhseáil faoi a bhfuil ar siúl ag an Rialtas agus nuair nach bhfuil cúrsaí ag dul go ró-réidh sa Rialtas, rud atá an-mhinic na laethanta seo, tá siad a rá nach bhfuil siad páirteach sa Rialtas.  Ach nuair a éiríonn le beartas de chuid an Rialtais &mdash; agus is rí-annamh a tharlaíonn a leithéid &mdash; bíonn an Páirtí Daonlathach an-ghasta chun a thabhairt le tuiscint gurb iad sin a cheap an beartas. Is doiligh liom a rá go léiríonn an páirtí sin, a cuireadh ar bun, dar leo féin, chun ionracas a chothú sa saol poiblí, mímhacántacht polaitiúil atá thar fóir agus atá glan in aghaidh na bprionsabal a cuireadh ar aghaidh ag deireadh 1985 nuair a bunaíodh an páirtí sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taimid uilig braon de bheith ag féachaint ar bhaill an pháirtí sin agus ag éisteacht leo ag clamhsán faoin Rialtas.  Dá mhéid clamhsáin a dheineann siad is mó a léiríonn siad nach bhfuil aon éifeacht chruthaitheach acu lena gcuid gníomhaíochta sa Rialtas.  Agus cad faoin gClár Rialtais a d'eisigh an dá pháirtí sin i mí Iúil 1989?  Ní h-aon ionadh go bhfuil athiniúcadh á dhéanamh acu ar an gClár sin mar tá teipthe air.  Tá teipthe air ó thaobh na fostaíochta de.  Bhí sé mar sprioc sa chlár sin 35,000 postanna nua a chur ar <Col N="726" /> fáil in aghaidh na bliana.  Dá réir sin, bheimis ag ceapadh go mbeadh 70,000 postanna nua curtha ar fáil ó mhí Iúil 1989 i leith.  Ach céard atá á mhaíomh ag an dTaoiseach?  Dúirt sé inné nach bhfuil ach 40,000 postanna nua curtha ar fáil ó 1987 i leith &mdash; sé sin le rá go bhfuil i bhfad níos lú ná trian den sprioc á aimsiú.  Sin teip thubaisteach do mhuintir na tíre seo. Tá an Taoiseach, Ceannaire an Pháirtí Daonlathaigh, an tAire Airgeadais, an tAire Saothair agus an tAire Leasa Shóisialaigh lán-chiontach sa teip sin, agus gach ceann acu níos cionntaí ná baill eile an Rialtais.  Níl éinne ina a measc go bhféadfaí stiúradh an Rialtais a thabhairt dó ar a iontaoibh dá mba rud é gur éirigh le cúlbhinseoirí Fhianna Fáil a ghlacadh le chéile agus an ruaig a chur ar an dTaoiseach faoi mar atá beartaithe ag cuid mhaith acu.</P>
    <P>Tá teipthe ar stráitéisí eacnamúla, airgeadúla agus fioscacha an Rialtais. D'éirigh le Fianna Fáil go réasúnta maith ar feadh dhá bhliain, ó 1987 go 1989, nuair a bhí srian a choinneáil orthu agamsa.  Ag éisteacht dom leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Leyden, agus leis an Aire Cosanta, bhí fonn gáire orm a chloisint cé chomh cairdiúil atá siad anois le straitéis na Tamhlachta, rud a thug siad droim láimhe dó ag an am go raibh sé i bhfad níos tábhachtaí don Rialtas go nglacfaí leis ná an beartas a rinne siad. Céard atá tite amach ó shin?  Tar éis toghcháin 1989 bhíomar ag súil go gcoinneodh an Páirtí Daonlathach an Rialtas ar na ráillí.  Is léir anois go raibh agus go bhfuil Fianna Fáil agus an Páirtí Daonlathach sár-oilte sa bhéalghrá.  Cé hé nár chuala faoin mhiorúilt eacnamúil i gcaitheamh na mblianta 1989 agus 1990 agus fiú chomh deireannach le tús an tsamhraidh i mbliana?  Cad a tharla don mhiorúilt sin?  Tá sí imithe le gaoth.</P>
    <P>Is é an Taoiseach féin a dúirt inné go mbeadh an Rialtas ag lorg iasachtaí de 2.5 faoin gcéad den ollthairgeadh náisiúnta i mbliana in ionad 1.9 faoin gcéad mar a beartaíodh sa Cháinfháisnéis bhréagach a cuireadh os comhair na Dála seo ag tús na bliana.  Tá deireadh leis an mhiorúilt. Go fírinneach, ní raibh miorúilt ar bith riamh ann.  Tá teipthe ar na polasaithe <Col N="727" /> seo agus tá an Taoiseach agus an tAire Airgeadais ciontach sa teip seo.  Bheadh sé cóir a rá freisin go bhfuil an Cathaoirleach ar deoraíocht atá ag an bPáirtí Daonlathach gach pioc chomh ciontach, nuair nár éirigh leis cnámh droma an pháirtí sin sa Rialtas a dhaingniú.  Maíonn an Taoiseach gur laghdaíodh caiteachas an Rialtais le £100 milliún le beartais a cinneadh i rith an tsamhraidh.  Ach tá a fhios ag an saol nach bhfuil déanta ach cuid de na fadhbanna a chur ar an méar fhada &mdash; réiteach a usáideann an Rialtas seo go han-mhinic.</P>
    <P>Cad é go beacht atá curtha ar an méar fhada?  Ar thaobh an chaipitil dhe tá sé an-éasca an freagra a aimsiú.  Séard atá curtha ar an méar fhada ná beartas ar bith nach bhfuil cabhair airgid ar fáil dó ón gComhphobal Eorpach.  Tá trealamh agus seomraí ospidéal curtha ar an méar fhada.  Tá trealamh sláinte curtha ar an méar fhada.  Daoine breoite agus daoine bochta a bheidh thíos dá bharr sin.  Tá scoileanna nua, seomraí scoile agus trealamh oideachas curtha ar an méar fhada.  Páistí a bheidh thíos leis sin.  Déanfar dochar dóibh anois agus amach anseo nuair a bheidh siad ag lorg postanna. Tá iarracht ar siúl ag an Rialtas anois sleamhnú as a gcuid oibleagáidí faoin <i>gClár um Dul chun Chinn Eacnamúil agus Sóisialta, an Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Clár é seo a thairg an Rialtas do na ceardchumainn agus a bhrú sé anuas ar na páirtithe sóisialta eile.  Clár bréagach a bhí ann nuair a síníodh é.  Tá sé gach pioc chomh lochtach agus a bhí an clár a chuaigh roimhe.  Bhí an bréag seo soiléir nuair a síníodh an clár agus ní haon ionadh go bhfuil sé anois ag titim as a chéile.  Tá an Taoiseach, an tAire Saothair agus an tAire Airgeadais, ach go háirithe, ciontach as an gcaimiléaracht atá go cnámh sa chlár seo.</P>
    <P>Tá Ceannaire an Pháirtí Daonlathaigh, an tAire Tionscail agus Tráchtála, an Teachta Deasún Ó Máille, chomh ciontach leo siúd.  Tá na lochtanna céanna agus lochtanna níos mó b'fhéidir, ar an gclár seo ná mar a bhí ar an gclár a chuaigh roimhe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> Ní raibh focal séimh nó cneasta nó caoin le rá ag an dTeachta O'Malley faoin gcéad chlár a bhí ann i mí Dheireadh Fómhair 1986.  Ach, ar ndóigh, ní raibh sé ina bhall den Rialtas ag an am sin. Aisteach go leor, níl focal ráite aige go poiblí faoi chlár an lae inniu.  Tá sé ina thost freisin faoin dífhostaíocht.  Aisteach a deirim nuair a mheabhraímid a ghlóraí is atá Cathaoirleach an pháirtí sin, nuair a chloisimid an feisire Eorpach atá ag an bpáirtí agus nuair a éistimid leis an Aire Stáit ag an Roinn Chomhshaoil, mar a dheinimid go rí-mhinic.</P>
    <P>Cad faoin Eoraip?  Mhaigh an Taoiseach inné go bhfuil seasamh an Rialtais ar na hábhair thábhachtacha atá faoi chaibidil anois soiléir, agus go bhfuil an Teach seo ar an eolas faoin a bhfuil ag titim amach agus a bheartú.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 25, 27 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, I am committed to providing the highest quality facilities and services for all our social welfare customers.  My Department have in recent years, in consultation with the Office of Public Works, been engaged in a programme to provide new offices and to improve existing ones in order to ensure a high standard of accommodation and facilities for the staff and members of the public who use these offices.  Good progress has been made on this programme with 17 new offices provided and a further ten extensively refurbished.</P>
      <P>I am determined that the progress already made in improving the standard of my Department's accommodation will be maintained and in this regard, the programme is being advanced as quickly as financial and technical resources will allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> I am aware of the problems associated with the office at Navan Road and I regard its replacement with a new office as a priority.  It had been intended to start work on the new office during the current year but the commencement date has had to be deferred pending a decision on the financial allocations for 1992.  However, the project is already being progressed with the recent appointment of a consultant architect to draw up an outline design which is due for completion by the end of the year.  I am now in a position to confirm that a contract for the Navan Road project will be placed by mid-September next.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned to settle the present dispute involving staff in Navan Road.  Action planned by the staff for 14 October has already been deferred and negotiations with staff representatives are continuing, with a view to securing a resumption of normal working arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply amazes me.  Is he aware that on 5 June this year he gave an undertaking in this House that work would begin on the building of the new offices at Navan Road this year?  He is now telling the House that work will not even begin next year.  Is he aware that this pre-fab building was designed for the reception of 3,000 members of the public each week and that there are now 8,000 people attending per week?  The conditions are Dickensian, to say the least, and the strain on the staff and the public has reached the point where the staff have threatened industrial action.  Can the Minister assure the House that this new undertaking, which has come on top of a pile of previous undertakings from the Minister and his Department to the staff and the public, has some type of validity?  The undertaking given to this House on 5 June 1991 was of no value since work was to have been undertaken by this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent we are at one remove.  It transpired since June that the Office of Public Works were having difficulty establishing an acceptable unit cost for the project and could not obtain sanction to appoint consultant architects to allow planning to commence.  Technical difficulties arose which have now been overcome and the architect has been appointed.  We have given firm dates for the progress of the work.  These dates have also been conveyed to the staff.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if the allocation in the 1991 budget for social welfare is sufficient to provide unemployment benefit and assistance payments for the increased numbers of people who are unemployed; if it is his intention to bring a Supplementary Estimate before Dáil Éireann; if so, when; the approximate amount of such an Estimate; and if he will quantify the loss to the Exchequer in PRSI payments as a result of the increased numbers on the dole.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on present trends, the allocation in the 1991 budget will not be sufficient to cover the full cost of the services provided by my Department this year.  Accordingly, I will be bringing a Supplementary Estimate before Dáil Éireann probably in late November. Work is in hand to establish the precise amount of additional funds which will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's published Estimate of the yield from PRSI contributions is £1,373 <Col N="733" /> million.  This Estimate was based on the numbers expected to be in employment or self-employed during 1991.  Current indications are that, in spite of the increased numbers on the live register, the numbers employed are holding up and the target of £1,373 million will be slightly exceeded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Government were caught completely by surprise by the dramatic rise in the numbers on the unemployment register?  If the Minister for Social Welfare is not in a position to give some indication as to how high that Supplementary Estimate will be, it shows that the strategic planning has not been done.

      <P>If there is such a huge increase in unemployment, how has the PRSI figure stayed the same?  The people at work must have paid a lot more. The Estimates for Social Welfare are out of kilter by at least £60 million but the Minister does not want to mention a figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the factual position.  The September returns will be available shortly and they will give some indication but we will not get a full indication until some time later.  The figure is likely to be in excess of £80 million in total.  We will know more about that later.  The level of income from PRSI is running above target at present and if it continues to do so, the demand will obviously be reduced.  The Deputy asked how the PRSI figure can be the same.  It is very simple.  Employment has held up and the numbers expected to be in employment have continued to be in employment.  The contributions expected from those people are holding up.  A number of emigrants have returned home and in many instances have gone on the live register, along with people whom the Department of Finance had anticipated would go away but who did not do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> Currently farmers and other self-employed people do not qualify for family income supplement.  I am very aware of the problems of low income farmers.  As I indicated recently to the Irish Farmers' Association, the possibility of introducing a pilot scheme to address the problems of low income farm families is one of a number of items for discussion in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Government have given a commitment in the programme that arrangements will be made to address the problem of low-income farming families, in consultation with farming organisations. Certain discussions have already taken place between my Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the IFA.  I will be initiating further discussions on the possibility of a pilot scheme shortly.  The introduction of any pilot scheme would have financial implications for my Department and therefore, fall to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at that reply.  In his budget speech the Minister for Finance said he had made available £1 million in his budget.  It is there for everybody to see.  The Minister is informing me that that £1 million will not be used in 1991.  Is he aware how financially badly off farmers are this year?  Furthermore, does he accept that it is nothing short of a scandal that 10,000 small farmers are being deprived of even £2 per week which is all it would mean to many of them anyway, at a time when a few individuals in the golden circle managed to get £8 million in the same period? It is a scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy might have a word with some of his friends who are in these golden circles because there are far more people in Fine Gael in golden circles than there ever were in Fianna Fáil, and that remains a fact today.  As far as we are concerned, £1 million was given to the Department of <Col N="736" /> Agriculture and Food and we have had discussions with that Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since October 1987 when the dental benefit scheme was extended to cover dependent spouses of insured workers, 285 dentists have signed the new agreement to provide treatment for that group. Allowing for retirements, resignations, deaths, etc., since then, that number is currently 250.  The total number of dentists on the Department's dental panel at present is 700.  A table setting out the <Col N="737" /> information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of dentists estimated to be treating dependent spouses in each county will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of the number of dental benefit claims received in respect of dependent spouses in each county since the extension of the scheme to this category is not readily available.  A total of 100,729 applications for treatment under the dental benefit scheme have been received from dependent spouses; 86,715 claims have been approved for payment to date at a cost of £4.8 million.</P>
    <P>Since my last statement on the matter in July of this year, discussions have been continuing between the Irish Dental Association and officials of my Department in an effort to bring this dispute to an end.  Meetings were held in September and early October.  These discussions have centred around outstanding issues in relation to the drawing up of a new dental agreement and a revised scale of fees for dental services.  The discussions are now in their final stages and I am hopeful that a successful outcome will emerge.</P>

      <P>I am sadly disappointed that the Minister has not been able to resolve this dispute that has been running since 1987.  This is a four year strike by the Irish Dental Association.  There are about 200,000 spouses, mainly women, who are affected by this dispute.  Not only are insured workers being charged for dental treatment they are entitled to by virtue of their insurance, but their spouses are being charged for treatment for which they are covered under their spouses' PRSI.  How can the Minister say that progress is being made, when there are only 250 dentists out of a panel of 700 operating the scheme?  When I was here last asking this question there were 276 operating the scheme so the numbers are decreasing.  Finally, will the Minister reassure the House, given his obligation in operating the PRSI scheme on behalf of people who are on social welfare who have paid PRSI, that he will have this scheme signed, sealed and delivered and operating to the benefit of those who are entitled to it before Christmas.</P>

      <P>The scheme was an extension to spouses of the existing scheme.  I thought the Deputy might be pleased to see that over 100,000 claims have been dealt with and 86,700 have been completed entirely at this stage.  In that sense there are some 100,000 people who have benefited from it.  The Deputy will be aware that the dental association as a body have opposed this scheme from the beginning.  Nevertheless we have been able to provide treatment for that number of people.  In the meantime, the discussions on a possible new agreement are practically at the final stages.  There is still the cost of any new agreement to be considered.</P>

      <P>There have been 8,400 applications for the carer's allowance up to week ending 4 October 1991.  The total number of persons in receipt of the allowance is 3,585.  Of these, 1,613 people have been awarded a payment at the maximum rate and 1,972 at a reduced rate.  The number of applications refused is 2,930. The remainder are awaiting decision or are still under investigation.</P>
      <P>Current claim trends indicate that over 25 per cent of applicants who have not been awarded a carer's allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment at a higher rate.</P>
      <P>The scheme was extended as provided for in section 8 of this year's Social Welfare Act to include carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance and carers of people with pensions from countries with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.  A total of 1,938 applications have been received under the extension of which 278 have been awarded and 513 have not qualified. The remainder await decision or are still under investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allowance as it stands is taxable when taken in conjunction with other income.  No statistics are available as to the numbers in receipt of the allowance <Col N="740" /> who would also be liable for tax but it is considered that the numbers affected would not be significant.</P>
    <P>The scheme is primarily directed at persons who are providing pensioners or recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance with full-time care and attention.  However, the means testing arrangements of these carers remain under review to see what improvements can be made within existing resources. The question of the total abolition of the means test would have cost implications which would have to be examined in a budgetary context as would the question of the retention of the living alone allowance and ancillary benefits by persons after the carer comes to live with them.</P>

The estimate of almost £8 million which was approved and agreed to in the House for this purpose will be spent for this purpose. With regard to the extra number of people who would obviously qualify if the income limits were raised, this has become much clearer from the evidence available in the applications which have been sent in.  That matter can be considered in the context of the next budget.</P>

      <P>I would, of course, agree with the Deputy that it is a very worthwhile scheme and I look forward to it being improved in time.  Some 3,585 people now benefit from the scheme and we have good information on the people who might benefit if the means were increased.  A study is currently being undertaken on means to see how best they can be improved.  The means test was taken originally as the means test for old age pensioners, an equivalent of that, and was deemed by the experts and all involved as the most suitable one for the purpose.

In view of the fact that the allowance is taxable, would the Minister agree that a woman &mdash; invariably it is women who look after the sick &mdash; who looks after her mother or <Col N="742" /> mother-in-law who is confined to bed with a stroke deserves to be seriously considered for a carer's allowance regardless of income?  Is this something the Minister might consider doing in the future?  Some people get this allowance even though the people they care for are not necessarily confined to bed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three different mechanisms, any one of which can be used.  The first is the social welfare one which was very specifically targeted and will use up the money which was targeted for it this year.  The second is a tax allowance to an individual who is caring for an elderly person.  The third is the tax allowance for bringing someone into care. Therefore, one would have to look at the whole picture to see what was the most appropriate arrangement for people and how these different schemes might be used to improve that whole area.  That is a matter to be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

I want to refer to a case of a person needing full-time care 24 hours a day: the claim number is 236696621N.  The carer got an allocation of £2 last week.  When that person is in bed at night she has to hire someone to mind the adult person she is caring for, for example change her nappies etc.  The person who comes in to relieve a carer who has to look after his or her relative for 365 days a year should also be entitled to receive a carer's allowance.  Care at night time is as vital as care during the day time.  That carer is one of the 3,585 people not receiving a <Col N="744" /> full carer's allowance.

That is one of the realities of the system and the legislation laid down by the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that very few of our carers receive a reduced allowance.  Would he not agree that the truth is that the majority of our carers receive no allowance because of a restricted means testing system?  Surely the Minister would agree that the best place for a person to be cared for is in their own environment, in their home, by their family.  In the long run, would it not be less expensive to make the carer's allowance more assessable because that would reduce the number of people taking up beds in our hospitals and in the long term would be more cost effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is better to provide care at home and in one's environment for a number of reasons.  I would be very much committed to that. However, this is the Department of Social Welfare and this is a social welfare scheme.  This is a scheme for people on social welfare or on the equivalent of social welfare.  If more resources are provided, we can go further.  The question the Deputy raised needs to be considered much more broadly.  I had hoped that the experience of this scheme in <Col N="746" /> practice would indicate the direction in which other schemes and arrangements might develop.  Perhaps that is what will happen.</P>

      <Quest>if he has any plans to give credit to workers who reach retirement age 65 and from whom social welfare contributions were not deducted from 1962 to 1974 because their earnings exceeded the limit for liability for social insurance in 1962 as in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Louth; his views on whether it is unfair that a person who worked for 47 years is only now granted a reduced pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to a retirement pension at age 65 is conditional on having 156 paid contributions, having entered insurance before age 55 years and having a minimum yearly average of contributions paid or credited from date of entry to age 65.  The minimum yearly average required is 24.</P>
      <P>The person concerned had an average of 35 contributions since entering insurance and accordingly was awarded a slightly reduced married rate retirement pension of £97.20 in March of this year which was increased to £101.10 in July. The current maximum rate for a married couple is £104.80.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to retirement and old age contributory pension is based on an average number of contributions over a person's insured lifetime.  This principle is generally considered a reasonable one. I have made special arrangements for certain people with gaps in their insurance records due to the operation of the remuneration limit for social insurance whose averages as a result were below the minimum of 29.  Subject to this, however, the average condition has been a feature of the schemes since the outset.</P>
      <P>The whole area of conditions for entitlement to pensions is among the issues being examined at present by the National Pensions Board.  I expect to receive the board's final report shortly. Any changes in the contribution conditions for pensions will be considered in the light of the board's recommendations in this area.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the detailed reply.  Basically, I was using those particular circumstances as an example but there are many others.  I would ask the Minister to note that in certain circumstances people who have not contributed to the system would qualify for non-contributory benefits and can receive a higher level of payment than those who are short a number of stamps, through no fault of their own but due to the decision taken between 1962 and <Col N="748" /> 1974.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, if a person's average number of contributions falls below the minimum they will switch to non-contributory and benefit from it but if they have a second income they will not benefit.  I will certainly bring that matter to the attention of the board.</P>

      <P>For the past three years, I have held a pre-budget forum in November at which a number of organisations with a particular interest in the social welfare area were invited to discuss with me their proposals and priorities for social welfare in the context of the annual budget.  These occasions proved to be successful and were very valuable to me and to the Government in formulating proposals for consideration in the lead up to the budget.  I propose to host another pre-budget forum next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> The Government's principal commitments in the area of social welfare reform are contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which was launched last January.  Specific undertakings have been given in the programme in relation to the development of the social welfare services under a number of headings such as improving existing social welfare payments in line with recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, introducing new measures for child income support and providing greater integration of social assistance provisions.  Proposals for inclusion in next year's Social Welfare Bill will be formulated within the framework of the programme.</P>

      <P>I do not want to object as I support the concept of pre-budget fora. I appreciate the broad general outlines of intent in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but that is not what the question is asking.  Last year for example, we had three days between publication and debate on the Social Welfare Bill which meant that interested bodies &mdash; Combat Poverty, FLAC, Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors &mdash; were handicapped in making submissions.  My request is that there should be sufficient time between publication and debate on the Bill.  The Minister should issue a general statement or a broad outline of what he intends to put into the Social Welfare Bill of the following year.</P>

      <P>In addition to holding the pre-budget forum, on budget day, for those organisations we hold a special information session &mdash; which has proved to be very valuable &mdash; during which our part of the budget is spelled out very clearly and any technical difficulties or any of the parts which may not be obvious are explained on that occasion.  The bulk <Col N="750" /> of the subsequent Social Welfare Bill is outlined either in the budget or in the Minister's budget speech.  Generally, notice is given of the majority of the elements in the Social Welfare Bill so its contents are not a surprise.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that you have these briefings on budget day, but that is not the point.  The point is that, following publication of the Social Welfare Bill, we have three days in which to prepare amendments for the debate in the House as have the groups who wish to lobby &mdash; and rightly so given that we live in a democracy &mdash; and make their opinions known on the specifics of the Bill but the time lag between the publication and the debate creates a difficulty for all politicians in preparing their amendments and submissions.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether the present system whereby medical referees decide on the eligibility or otherwise of applicants for disability benefit is working satisfactorily.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that decisions relating to the claims for disability benefit are taken by my Department's deciding officers, not by medical referees.</P>
      <P>Deciding officers are appointed under section 295 of the Social Welfare Act, 1981 to determine questions which arise under the legislation, including whether or not a person is entitled to disability benefit.  To assist them in this, certain cases are referred to a medical referee for a second medical opinion to that of the person's doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical referees are qualified medical <Col N="751" /> practitioners.  They are recruited by the Civil Service Commission and a condition of their appointment is that they must have at least six years experience in general medical practice.</P>
    <P>In carrying out examinations, the medical referee reviews the history of the case, including the initial diagnosis already made by the person's medical practitioner, considers any fresh reports received and expresses an opinion based on the results of his or her medical examination of the claimant.  It is open to the claimant's medical practitioner to attend a medical referee examination if he or she so wishes.</P>
    <P>Generally, a person is regarded as being incapable of work if he or she is unable to follow his or her usual occupation. However, if a person is ill for a long time, the question of whether he or she may be capable of doing other types of work may arise.  Individual factors are taken into account such as age, physique, and work history.</P>
    <P>If, following examination by a medical referee, payment of disability benefit is disallowed because the person is not regarded as incapable of work, he or she may appeal the case to the independent social welfare appeals office.  In these circumstances, the normal procedure is to first refer the case to a different medical referee to carry out a further examination of the person.</P>
    <P>If the second medical referee is also of the opinion that the person is not incapable of work, the case is referred to an appeals officer to determine.  The appeals officer considers all the evidence, the reports of the medical referees, the evidence of the claimant's doctor, any other medical report and the client's evidence. If the appeals officer considers the case requires it, he or she may arrange for an independent medical consultant's report to assist in determining the case. An appeals officer's decision is final and may be revised only in the light of new facts or fresh medical evidence.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the medical referee <Col N="752" /> examination system works in a satisfactory manner.  The role of the medical referees is to provide my Department's deciding officers and appeals officers with advice on matters about which they have professional expertise.  They do this in a conscientious and impartial manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all Deputies will join with the Minister in his efforts to get rid of abuse in the social welfare system. We agree that the Minister has done quite a good job in that regard.  However, people can be over zealous in their efforts to get things right.  Is the Minister aware that quite a few cases are coming to light that show that officials, in their efforts to get people off the unemployment register or the disability benefit list, as in this case, are making bad mistakes?  Will the Minister see to it that officials in his Department scrutinise cases more closely to ensure that grave injustices do not occur?</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply referred to medical referees consulting with the applicant's family doctor.  I know of a case where the medical referee absolutely dismissed the views of the applicant's family doctor.  That is a very serious circumstance. Will the Minister examine cases like that more closely particularly when Dáil Deputies bring these cases to his notice by way of Dáil Questions?  The Minister said that the decisions can be appealed, but I find that, even on appeal, there are grave miscarriages of justice. I will give one instance which I have mentioned to the Minister.  It concerns a woman who was virtually crippled who was unable to get a disability benefit allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of overzealousness does not arise in the case of the medical referee.  It may arise in terms of the frequency of interviewing. Because of computerisation there is more frequent checking of people in relation to the illness recorded for them. That is the only change.  The system remains the same and the medical referee has only a professional opinion to give.</P>

      <Col N="753" /> In relation to the question of scrutinising cases more closely, when Deputies highlight specific cases, we ask the appeals board to look closely at them and take into account what Deputies have said.  As the Deputy will know, in some cases people have not presented all the evidence or did not present their case very well.  Every effort is made, particularly on appeal, to ensure that people have an opportunity to present a full case. At the end of the day there may be disagreement. At that stage we are really in the hands of the medical people concerned.</P>
    <P>We have a disability benefit system which goes beyond a year.  This is not common in other countries.  In other countries at the end of six months or 12 months one either receives an invalidity pension or payments cease.  We purposely maintained a system which goes beyond that because some people would not qualify for invalidity pension.  Invalidity pension is there as an alternative for people who are seriously ill or handicapped in one way or another.</P>
    <P>The appeals officers do their utmost to be fair and impartial.  The office was set up last September or October and they are performing their function on behalf of all of us.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Would the Minister agree that if the medical referee makes a decision, it is basically a closed shop and it is difficult to have it changed?  I can give the Minister proof of that.  I asked one of my constituents to get a further medical report from a leading specialist in a Dublin hospital.  When I opened the envelope I noticed the specialist had written on it, &ldquo;the Office of the Ombudsman&rdquo;.  As far as he was concerned he was wasting his time in that case.  The specialist had found this person unfit for work but his letter was being completely ignored by the medical referee.  When I contacted the Office of the Ombudsman later, following this case through, the Office of the Ombudsman told me that if there was a medical dispute he could not make a decision on it.  I presumed that the report <Col N="754" /> of a specialist in Dublin, who has all the modern gadgetry to carry out all sorts of tests, would take precedence over the report of a little busy body going down with his travel bag to a dark empty room in any office in the country, sitting opposite a person, smiling and telling him that he is fit for work.  There is something wrong with the system.  One gets a raw deal when going before a medical referee who says one is fit for work simply because one's hair might be looking well on that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an element which I should have explained.  If a person has been on disability benefit for a year or more, a time arises when he may be considered fit for other types of work than the work he previously did.  The decision at that stage could be that generally speaking a person is fit for other work though, perhaps, not for heavy work. That causes difficulties at times.  There is misunderstanding of the system and how it operates.  There are probably quite a few people in this House whom specialists would confirm as not being fit for work, certainly not fit for lifting anything and so on, but they would be fit for other kinds of work.</P>

      <P>The Minister has alluded to the question I want to raise, that is the difficulty of the description by medical consultants of people being capable of light work.  Very often, the person involved is a builder's labourer who has injured his back or leg.  He might be able to type but that is of no significance as he has no qualification in that sphere.  That is one of the difficulties which the system does not deal with.  I think the Minister needs to examine that because manual labourers are regularly excluded from disability benefit because a consultant has said they are capable of light work.  They are not qualified for light work, they are only qualified for heavy work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is possible for them to bring their own medical doctor.  With regard to qualifications, a minimum six years experience is required.  Among the medical referees there are the following: a consultant &mdash; one of the specialists we have been talking about; an occupational physician; a doctor with a Master's degree in psychotherapy &mdash; another difficult area &mdash; ten doctors who have done extra studies in occupational medicine; a doctor who holds a special diploma in occupational health, and two others who are studying for it at present.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it theoretically or practically possible for a person who has been disallowed disability benefit to be granted an invalidity pension?  I have a client who has been disallowed disability benefit but who for all practical purposes is an invalid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is possible if further medical evidence is brought forward which shows that there is a definite and real medical problem which will be of long duration.  This could result from an appeal with regard to disability benefit. The area that the Deputy is mentioning in particular is that of back problems and the question of how much work a person can do if they have a back problem.  There is no doubt that this is one of the great problem areas.</P>

      <P>The first consolidation of social welfare legislation since the unified social insurance system was introduced in 1952 was the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, which I introduced. In view of the many amendments and extensions to the social welfare system over the last ten years I consider <Col N="758" /> it appropriate to introduce a new consolidation Bill.  Work has already commenced on this.  I hope to be in a position to complete the work in 1992.</P>

      <P>There is not a great deal that can be said if the work is in progress. All I can do is congratulate the Minister for taking on board the contents of the motion.  As the Minister will appreciate, such a consolidation Bill is extremely complex given that Social Welfare Bills are brought forward on an annual basis and a huge range of amendments, resulting from budgetary changes to the social welfare code, accumulate over a ten year period.  Our social welfare code is extremely complex but if we can bring it all together and tie up all the loose ends in one publication, it might be easier to deal with in the future.</P>

I said when I put the previous Bill through the House ten years ago that a further consolidation Bill should be put through within ten years at the outside. I hope Deputies will co-operate when that Bill is introduced as it can take a great deal of time and effort to get such legislation through even though it is only a consolidation Bill.</P>

      <P>An increasing number of people are availing of their statutory right to appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office which I established at the start of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> I am aware of the need for additional resources for the office and have taken the necessary steps in this regard so that these arrears can be quickly eliminated and a speedy, efficient service provided for appellants.</P>
    <P>An average of the time taken to resolve an appeal is not at present readily available.  The time taken depends on a number of factors such as the nature of the appeal, whether a further medical examination is necessary, whether new evidence produced with the appeal has to be investigated, whether the appeal can be determined on a summary basis or whether an oral hearing is necessary. An average figure would not, in the circumstances, be meaningful.  Procedures are being considered in the appeals office, however, to ensure that relevant information on trends will be available for the future.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, with the measures taken to date and the additional resources I am providing to deal with the new needs identified, the independent social welfare appeals office will be in a position to provide a consistent, efficient and prompt service.</P>
    <P>The chief appeals officer is now obliged by law to submit an annual report to me. I will have his report on the activities of the office for 1991 early next year.  The activities of the social welfare appeals system will be monitored in the light of that report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of a case which the appeals office took approximately six months to process.  It is a glaring indictment of the new, independent appeals body.  Quite clearly, the Minister has not given the resources to this body.  Either he got the figures completely wrong in relation to the numbers of people who would use the service or, more likely, has deliberately sought to dissuade people from using the appeals system.  As time goes on I will be demanding the increase of the staffing ratio in the office so that it will have meaning and make <Col N="760" /> sense to anybody genuinely pursuing an appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain inherent delays in an appeals system because a person has to be notified in relation to a disability benefit case if there is to be a second examination.  The disallowance of disability benefit probably causes the greatest amount of delay.  The office ask the section in the Department to furnish a report in the first instance and, almost inevitably, that will lead to a need for a second medical examination.  There has been an increase in the number of applications for qualification certificates because of the increased number of unemployed and people coming back from England which has put additional pressure on the office.  However, the office is generally doing very well.  I hope that any difficulties will be overcome in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister is fully aware of people's frustration in this regard.  Like other Deputies, I could give examples of people waiting as long as 34 weeks for the result of their appeal.  Is it true that on occasions files are left somewhere within the system &mdash; I am not sure where &mdash; for as long as 14 or 15 weeks without a human being going near them?  A huge proportion of queries to Members in the west relates to social welfare.  I accept that the Minister made efforts to try to streamline the system a few years ago but I have never seen it as bad as it is now.  Why are files sent from local employment exchanges to Dublin, Sligo and other places?  It reminds me of a fiddler's elbow, obviously nobody is able to direct control.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The office will have to communicate with the particular section to get the facts.  A person has to be given a couple of weeks' notice in relation to when their appeal will be heard so that <Col N="761" /> they can make arrangements to attend. Almost all disability benefit appeals are heard orally, something which Deputies wanted.  That may not always be necessary but almost everybody gets an oral hearing.  Therefore, there is an average delay of five or six weeks in the appeals process.  One must remember that it has gone through a number of other appeals and that a decision has been taken against the person.  People have often said to me that their case has gone on and on without a positive decision.  However, the reason for this is that they have been turned down twice or three times previously and are still contesting it.  They tend to estimate the time the appeal takes from the first appeal to the last, which makes it seem longer.  There is also difficulty in getting information, especially in rural areas, about land or bank accounts.</P>

      <P>By and large, the appeals officers are doing a good job.  In the eight months to the end of August 1991 about 16,000 appeals were received, an increase on the previous year when it was only starting.  One of the factors which has affected it is the number of people coming home, looking for qualification certificates and appealing in relation to them.  However, one must take into consideration that that may not be a continuing feature.</P>

Is he aware that the files which give the information to the appeals office from the local exchange are not regularly available to an appeals officer when he is trying to make a decision?  Is he aware that four out of five positions of appeals officer in Oisín House are vacant and that only one appeals officer is operating?  On the two days I attended, that was the case and I was told it was the regular situation.  In view of that, will he consider applying resources to the appeals office to allow <Col N="762" /> for appeals officers on site so that appeals can be heard?

I am sure the Minister will be interested to hear that the appellant won it.  Therefore, not all cases which go to the appeals office are frivolous, vindictive or unsubstantiated.

      <Quest>if he will make arrangements to rectify the current situation where widowers are not entitled to six weeks contributory pension based on the pension of their late spouse; the reason for this anomaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 34 &amp; 37 together.</P>
      <P>Under the present social welfare arrangements a widow becomes entitled to widow's pension in the event of her husband's death.  A contributory pension is provided, subject to certain contribution conditions, which can be satisfied either on the widow's own or her deceased husband's insurance.</P>
      <P>In 1989 I extended the widows (non-contributory) pension scheme to cover widowers with dependent children.  Following this I initiated a comprehensive review within my Department of the income maintenance provisions for the various categories of lone parents. Arising from this review I introduced the lone parents allowance scheme in 1990. This provided for the first time a non-contributory pension for widowers with dependent children.</P>
      <P>The extension of the present social insurance arrangements to widowers would cost an estimated £25 million in a full year.  The issue of extending such cover to widowers generally arises for consideration in the context of proposals published in 1987 by the EC Commission for the adoption of a directive aimed at completing the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  The EC Council is continuing its examination of the proposal for such a directive.  As Deputies will be aware, the 1979 EC directive on equal treatment of men and women in matters of social security did not apply to widows pension and similar payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> The question of social insurance provision for widowers is also being examined by the National Pensions Board in the context of the proposals for a new national pensions system.  I expect to receive the board's recommendations shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Kenny's question, I presume he is referring to after death payment.  This is payable where a claimant dies and the payment which that person was receiving included an adult dependant increase, or would have included such an increase but for the fact that the claimant's spouse was in receipt of old age (non-contributory) pension, blind pension or carer's allowance.  The payment made to the deceased may continue for six weeks after his or her death. This after death payment is available to both men and women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is a very complex matter, but I would like to know why a male teacher is not entitled to survivor's benefit if his spouse dies. This is obviously a matter that is of grave concern to a great number of people. That is the reason for this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the reason is that the pension cover for the teacher does not include a widower's pension. This is one of the areas which causes major problems right across the EC.  It has delayed implementation of the directive in this regard, but the directive is being considered.  The difficulties and the costs arising for the different countries involved are very substantial.  As far as I am concerned, I want to continue making progress in that direction.  That is why we brought in the lone parent's allowance scheme which for the first time covers everybody on a means tested basis, including widowers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We are basically talking about two groups of people.  Both groups pay equal tariffs and the only difference between them is their gender.  How can the Minister justify continuation of a difference in the benefit arising from the payment of the same tariff by two groups <Col N="766" /> of people, the only difference between them being their gender?  Is the Minister going to continue with this arrangement? Is it not likely that a case will be brought to Europe on this matter if the Minister does not implement the equality regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the regulation does not include this matter.  Discussions are taking place with a view to the adoption of a directive aimed at the whole principle of equal treatment.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>Regulations will be introduced shortly to enable people who have gaps in their records as a result of having been insured for periods in public service type employment to qualify for pension.  These new arrangements will provide that in cases of a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; insurance record a <i>pro-rata</i> pension will be payable which will be proportionate to the periods of insurance completed at the rate appropriate for old age-retirement pension purposes.  Any increases of pension payable in respect of an adult dependant will be calculated on a similar basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> People qualfying for the new <i>pro-rata</i> pensions will also become eligible for additional benefits such as free electricity, free television licence, free telephone rental which would otherwise not be available to them.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements are similar to those which apply under EC regulations to people who have mixed insurance in a number of different EC member states. A similar formula applies under various reciprocal agreements on social security to which Ireland is a party.  Accordingly this formula is regarded as the internationally recognised standard for the award of pensions in cases of mixed insurance.</P>
    <P>I believe that these arrangements represent a fair and equitable basis for the treatment of people with mixed insurance records under both Irish legislation and international agreements.</P>
    <P>In 1988 I introduced special partial old age pensions for people who became compulsorily insured for pension in April 1974 but failed to qualify for pension because of gaps in their insurance record caused by the operation of the remuneration limit.  These pensions are provided to persons with contribution averages of between five and 19 per annum.  These arrangements were devised to deal with this once-off situation arising from the removal of the remuneration limit in 1974.  They were designed to provide such persons with pensions which bear a reasonable relationship to those payable to persons becoming insured for the first time in 1974.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask two supplementary questions.  First, is it still the intention to have these arrangements in place for the month of November and, if so, could the Minister be more precise as to when the regulations will be made? Second, in relation to the calculation of the adult dependant rate on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, would the Minister accept that that is a departure from the regulations which already exist for reduced contributory old age pensions and for the intermittent group, in both of which cases the adult <Col N="768" /> dependant rate is given in full?  Would the Minister agree that the method he is now proposing to introduce for the mixed rate contributions will create an anomaly whereby people, for example, with the same average contributions in the intermittent group would be entitled to about £35 a week more than people with mixed contributions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They are two different cases.  The intermittent group is a specific clear-cut group who were forced out of the system.  The other group is a long term, ongoing group and there will always be cases of people with mixed insurance changing from one situation to another.  We have adopted the generally accepted principle which is applied at EC level and under international agreements. As an ongoing arrangement we would have to comply with those in any event. While the adult dependant allowance is paid at the <i>pro rata</i> rate, the child dependant allowance remains at the full rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reconsider the position regarding the adult dependant rate since the method he is now proposing to introduce for the calculation of the adult dependant rate is a very significant departure from the traditional method by which adult dependants have been treated?  Would he not agree that this is creating a very dangerous precedent which may be extended to other areas of social welfare payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to now cover was not provided for mixed insurance; this is the first time it has been provided.  It is a very major benefit to the people concerned, many of whom were particularly anxious to have some cover under mixed insurance because it would enable them to get some of the extras which other people were able to benefit from, but they could not get it in any event.  That was one of the major points they made <Col N="769" /> to me during our discussions.  I am introducing a broadly based and continuous scheme, but we have to be consistent with the EC transfers between countries and with the agreements outside countries. The scheme will be operated on that basis.  In fact that is what we have to do.</P>

      <P>May I avail of the opportunity while the Minister is still here to raise an issue.  I tabled a Private Notice Question today in relation to the courts dispute which is in its ninth week.  To my amazement it was refused on the grounds that it lacks urgency.  I cannot think of anything that is more urgent than access to the courts by members of the public.  In fact, I reckon it is a constitutional requirement on the part of the Minister to provide access to the courts.  This is something that should be discussed in the Dáil but I am being denied the opportunity to do so through a parliamentary question.  I ask that the Minister for Social Welfare will convey to his colleague, the Minister for Justice, the need to come into the House and make a short statement in relation to this matter.  I do not think I can raise this matter tomorrow.</P>

The Ceann Comhairle adjudicates on all matters and anybody who is unhappy about a decision is at liberty to discuss it with the Ceann Comhairle.  It is the Ceann Comhairle who makes the decision and not the Minister. I could not allow the Deputy to issue that invitation to the Minister as I must uphold the decision of the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate. The debate on the scandals engulfing this country is time-consuming and is taking <Col N="830" /> away from the real issues that affect this country, the fall in farm incomes, rural development, health care, jobs and housing. These are the basic needs that the ordinary everyday person in this country is concerned about and they have not yet been discussed despite the fact that we are now back in Leinster House for two days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scandal would never have arisen if a number of people had not been promoted by the present Government as the <i>prima donnas</i> of the business world, out of whose book we were told we should take a leaf, because they were the people who set a standard and who had the ability to do what others could not.  There are honest decent business people in this country and 95 per cent of business people are honest and decent and nobody should have any fear of doing business with them.  They were picked on and were made feel in some way inadequate because they could not make the vast wealth that this small handful were capable of making.  This small handful have turned out to be nothing more than conmen.  The conmen at the fair of long ago, the smart alek with his three cards, produced the joker time and again when it suited him.  The people gathered around him and placed their bets, but the joker was not there.  The joker can take any shape, it could be a red brick building with &ldquo;JMB&rdquo; stamped across it or an old college with &ldquo;CC&rdquo; stamped across it or maybe a large lump of sugar. Whatever form it took it was a joker.  It was placed where it could not be got at but was brought to light when it suited. The conman of old could not succeed and his business could not develop if he did not have his shill, the fellow who would come from the crowd when people were beginning to see that there was nothing to be made on this, and place his bet and make a vast amount of money.  People would then become interested.  He worked with a conman but was not seen to be associated with him.  That is where the Government come in with their shill, these conmen, so-called businessmen, who were <Col N="831" /> trying to reap vast riches from the unfortunate taxpayers of this country.  I hope we have seen the last of it and that they have been exposed for what they are. The Government have been found out to their shame and they are trying now to disassociate themselves from them but they will not get away with it.</P>
    <P>However, I would prefer to spend my time talking about the real issues, the fall in farm incomes.  The Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, came into the Dáil this evening but never as much as mentioned the impossibility of selling small cattle in the marts throughout the length and breadth of the country at present.  Never in the history of this country was farm income so depressed, and I want to bring that to the attention of urban Deputies as well as rural Deputies, who are very much aware of it at all times.  In the past if milk prices were low then the prices paid for cattle, pigs, poultry or turkeys were high. But at this stage everything has collapsed, and we have a Government that is seen to be completely inadequate to deal with the problems.  That will not be accepted by the people of this country because the agricultural industry is the bedrock of this economy.  There is an old saying that when the farmers are doing well, then the country is doing well.  The farmers are not doing well and the country's economy has collapsed.</P>
    <P>The scandal in relation to the eradication of bovine TB has gone on for too long &mdash; the disease has now been with us for more than 40 years and we are no further down the line than we were on the day we started.  There is the problem of BSE, for which this country was labelled, when, in fact, only a few cases of BSE occurred here and they were found to have been caused by imports of either cattle or feed.  However, the Minister, his officials and the Government have done nothing to make clearly heard abroad in the marketplaces of Europe and further afield the message that our cattle have a disease-free status second to none.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, comes the scandal of jungle juice and angel dust being used to <Col N="832" /> boost the production of lean beef.  Last July in the House I asked a question of the Minister in relation to this very serious problem.  He assured me and the House that the problem was in hand and that there were adequate measures in the factories and abattoirs to detect the substances.  However, ten days ago in a comprehensive, full page article published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> it was clearly stated, and has not been since denied, that the use of those prohibited substances is now as widespread as it was 12 months ago when it first surfaced.  I should like the Minister to answer that challenge.</P>
    <P>Confidence?  How could one have confidence in a Minister or a Government who are so incapable of dealing with these major problems?</P>
    <P>I should also like to know about rural development.  The Taoiseach referred to the Structural Fund.  I state here and now, clearly and categorically, that the Irish uptake of the Structural Fund is behind quota.  Ireland is one of three member states in the European Community that have not to date taken up the quota of Structural Funds available to them. However, there is widespread demand for funding.  The infrastructure of the country is in tatters; our county roads are impassable; small children cannot get to school without wearing wellingtons; school buses cannot traverse certain roads; doctors are refusing to call to homes because of the risk of damage to their cars &mdash; there is a litany of problems, and all because our county roads have been allowed to reach a deplorable state. Yet there is funding from Brussels available for the improvement and development of the roads.  Why are the Structural Funds allocations being held up?</P>
    <P>I shall tell Members why funding is being held up.  I received information from Brussels that there is indecision within the Government between a Minister of State, Deputy Mary Harney, and the Minister for Transport and Tourism, Deputy Séamus Brennan, as to whether a rail system should be set up around Dublin city or from Dublin Airport to O'Connell Bridge.  That is one of the <Col N="833" /> most outrageous proposals I have ever heard.  Dublin city is so adequately serviced in relation to transport &mdash; it has excellent roads, excellent bus services and a DART system that costs every Irish taxpayer &ldquo;X&rdquo; amount of pounds to be kept on the rails.  However, the Government believe that a further rail system for Dublin city is a priority.  As a result of that, allocations from the Structural Funds are being held up in Brussels.  That is a serious challenge and I stand over it, but I also say that the Structural Funds were never intended for the development of the large urban areas.  To my knowledge and to the understanding of the people of this country who turned out in their hundreds at parish meetings with ideas of developing their holdings and their private homes for further income, these funds were to be spent in rural Ireland.  Lo and behold, the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Coalition Government say that there are no votes in rural Ireland, that it is better to plant it, that it is easier to look into the woods than it is to canvass them and that the money should be spent in Dublin city, where the population and the votes are. They have forgotten about rural Ireland; they have forgotten that there is life beyond Phoenix Park.  It is a sad state of affairs that the Government are creating a rural/urban divide in this country and in this House.  I do not like that division, it is wrong and it should not be allowed to happen.  But if that is the way the Government face up to the decision then let us, the rural Deputies, speak with one voice and demand that the rural areas get their fair share of the national cake and that all parts of this country &mdash; be they on the east coast or the west coast &mdash; are developed to the same level.  What is fish for one should be fish for the another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, and I shall come back to it.  I wish to mention in passing the standard of Irish health care.  It is now a fact that people over 80 in this <Col N="834" /> country are not wanted and have no place if their families cannot look after them. All over the country there are waiting lists for the county homes, and when old people arrive at their doors the message is: &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot take you in, we cannot afford to look after you.&rdquo;.  It is not good enough that that is the message given to people who have given their lives to this country.  It is an indictment of the Government and their past record.</P>
      <P>I have no confidence in the Government. They should do the honourable thing, move over, let us take over and we will do the job.</P>

      <P>This motion of confidence comes at mid-term, halfway through the present Government's period of office.  It comes at a time when the Government are facing serious economic and social problems.  It is precisely at this time and in this sort of situation that the Government need to be given a mandate by the House to get on with the job &mdash; that is what is important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am voting for them very strongly here and I am speaking in favour of a motion of confidence in the Government on that account.  Nobody wants a general election at this stage.  So far as any of us can gauge the pulse of public opinion, it is quite evident that what the public want is for this Government to stay and deal with the problems.  The problems are there.  I share with others from all parties who have spoken with concern about a series of economic and social problems facing Irish society at present. Those problems are a matter for the Government to tackle as expeditiously as possible; they are not a reason for a general election.  In my view, this is precisely the time we should not have a general election.  It is a period in which we must gather the forces in our community together and tackle the problems that are there and that have certainly come upon us in a substantial way, particularly in the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> The problems are there for us all to see.  There is the jobs crisis &mdash; and it should be called a crisis &mdash; and there is the related problem of stimulating investment to cope with that.  There is the further problem on the agricultural front of negotiating the whole Common Agricultural Policy with a view to meeting reforms in that policy that are essential if the nations of the world are to get together into what is required, a new trading relationship under the auspices of GATT.  It is quite certain the Common Agricultural Policy, as devised at present, giving rise to the surpluses that have arisen, is inadequate to deal in a rational way with agricultural policies within the European Community or with the trading policies of the Community with the rest of the world.  That is a major task now facing the Government.  On the three important aspects of jobs, investment and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy what we need is to have the present Government in place, directed by this House, to pursue this course vigorously.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, there is the overriding problem of the public finances facing into a serious budgetary position, one that will have to be dealt with no matter who is in Government.  A general election will not solve that.  Whatever Government is put in place will have to face up to that problem, of getting the nation's finances in order and presenting a budget to this House at the end of January next, that will create the necessary climate of confidence in our capacity to handle our financial affairs.  Unless that climate of confidence is there &mdash; and seen by the world at large to be there &mdash; we will not get the investment required to deal with the jobs crisis.  All of these problems are interlinked and can be dealt with only by a Government in power backed by a mandate of this House.  All that a general election can ensure, or all that any divisive approach to the Government of this country can ensure at present is a degeneration into further chaos, chaos in regard to all the problem areas I have just mentioned.  That is something the <Col N="836" /> general public do not want.  We can keep the matter in perspective if we take that national approach to it: there must be a Government in place to handle these serious problems that have arisen.  This Government is in mid-term and has another two to two-and-a-half years to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Of course, part of that problem is the very important matter of confidence in Government administration.  Government administration must be seen to be competent, must be seen to be clear and fair.  In brief, we must have good government, there must be seen to be good government, transparently there must be good government.  That is why these recent financial scandals &mdash; and they are financial scandals &mdash; have clouded the atmosphere in this respect.  In order to ensure that the climate of confidence we require is maintained and enhanced the Government's paramount duty is to clear the air in regard to these financial scandals. These financial scandals are not of a political making.  Politicians of all parties in this House do this democratic institution a grave disservice in throwing about political allegations &mdash; and this applies to all parties in the House &mdash; when what we are dealing with here is a number of financial scandals, particularly in regard to executives in the State-sponsored service.  These financial scandals will have to be dealt with expeditiously, blame apportioned and action taken by the Government to deal with the people responsible.  What we are dealing with there is a new form of greed culture not just endemic here but in many other parts of the world.  We have seen similar type scandals occur in New York, Tokyo and in London, all within the past few months.  There has been also a major financial banking scandal involving the BCCI.</P>
    <P>This sort of financial or what one might describe as greed culture that has developed here and in other parts of the world is part of the new growth of speculation surrounding money markets made possible by easy computerised communications and the new technological capacity to make a fast buck.  This must <Col N="837" /> be controlled in the social interest. Indeed it is the duty of every Government to introduce the social controls required to deal with the vicissitudes of the marketplace and of the money market. That is a paramount social obligation lying on the shoulders of every Government in the democracies of the world, to ensure that financial matters governing the marketplace are under social control and management, to ensure that if there is to be a free market, it really is a free and fair one.  I predict that it will be in that area that the new politics of the social market will prevail, involving the marketplace, in regard to the competitive exchange of goods and services while, at the same time, ensuring that the marketplace is a really fair and equitable one, supervised by ethical rules and regulations. In addition, if people disobey those ethical rules and regulations they must suffer penalties by way of fines or imprisonment, penalties of whatever kind are deemed to be proper.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of what the Government should do at present is pursue to the utmost degree the various investigative inquiries that have been set afoot in regard to the four financial scandals there have been within our community in recent times.  Such an approach has been adopted and inspectors appointed to ascertain the facts in regard to the Sugar Company-Greencore affair, in regard to the Telecom affair, in regard to the Aer Lingus Holdings involving a scandal amongst executives of their own travel subsidiary.  The Director of Public Prosecutions has a file in regard to that matter.  In regard to the Goodman affair a tribunal is now sitting and the courts are interacting with that tribunal.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with what is in my view the grossest of those scandals, that is the one involving the Sugar Company and Greencore, involving the privatisation of the Sugar Company and the transactions that took place within the Sugar Company within a few months in 1989-90 when a profit of some £7 million to £8 million was made by four or five &mdash; depending on who owned Talmino, the offshore company &mdash; executives of the <Col N="838" /> Sugar Company and of its subsidiary, Irish Sugar Distributors.  That profit of £7 million to £8 million involved an appreciation of 500 per cent in value over a few months in 1989-90.  That 500 per cent profit of £7 million to £8 million went into the pockets of those executives of the Irish Sugar Company and its subsidiary, Irish Sugar Distributors.  They were facilitated in that respect by an interest-free loan of £1 million, made available for the purpose of that transition, enabling Gladebrook Limited to acquire a 49 per cent share subsequently taken over by the Sugar Company proper.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts of the matter.  What is even more serious than that &mdash; and that is serious enough &mdash; is the fact that that appreciation of 500 per cent, involving that profit of £7 million to £8 million was approved by the chief executive of the Investment Bank of Ireland, Mr. Richard Hooper.  Therefore, that particular profit made within a few months on a product that did not change in value or volume, that is sugar, in a captive market called the Republic of Ireland, was approved by the Investment Bank of Ireland as being a legitimate appreciation in value of those particular shares within that short period of a few months.  That is intolerable; that is criminality, nothing more, nothing less, on the part of the people involved, on the part of all the advisers involved, financial consultants, accountants, lawyers and also the chairman and chief executive of what was then the Irish Sugar Company, now Greencore Limited.  The chief executive and secretary of Greencore Limited have already parted company with Greencore. The chairman remains.  In my view he should follow suit.</P>
    <P>That is a financial scandal.  It has nothing to do with politics, politicians or Government.  In my view all political parties in this House do a disservice to democracy by implying that there is anything political whatever in that.  Yes, it is symptomatic of a type of greed culture, a sort of behavioural phenomenon occurring so blatantly with the co-operation of so many professional people.  It is outside <Col N="839" /> the arena of politics but something with which politicians must deal.</P>
    <P>It is the challenge of this Government &mdash; and I am glad to see they are facing up to it &mdash; to fully investigate this matter to ensure that these investigations are concluded as expeditiously as possible, so that when those conclusions come to hand Government action will be taken, be seen to be taken by them, in order to allay public disquiet, thereby ensuring there is not a repetition of such action in the future.  There have been similar instances of malpractice of a financial kind in the Telecom affair, in the Aer Lingus Holiday's affair and in the Goodman affair.  They are all being properly investigated and when conclusions are reached I hope action will be taken.</P>
    <P>One further aspect should be seriously considered by the Government and by the House in the interests of establishing permanent confidence among the public at home and abroad in our financial institutions and in our administration generally. We must ensure so far as is humanly possible that matters of the kind I have mentioned do not happen again. We will not be able to prevent fraud or malpractice but we can ensure as far as possible that there is transparency in these matters and that the Government of the day are seen to be setting up the requisite procedures.</P>
    <P>The Government should examine as a matter of urgency the establishment of a watchdog commission on the lines of a similar commission in the United States which supervises the Stock Exchange and financial dealings by the Government and the public.  We have ample precedents here of efficient and effective commissions. The Civil Service Commissioners supervise the area of Civil Service appointments.  Local appointments are dealt with by the Local Appointment Commissioners.  There are also the Revenue Commissioners.  For over 100 years the Land Commissioners performed a fantastic task in transferring <Col N="840" /> land from the landlord class to the tenantry and in the process providing for compensation right across the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>They made a few doubtful decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed they did, but we remedied them from time to time.  We have a tradition of commissions of this kind.  We have commissioners who are independent of the Government of the day in performing their duties.  We need such a commission to supervise the allocation of contracts and consultancies, be they legal or financial, on the part of Government Departments, Government Agencies and semi-State agencies.  Fees for estate agents, accountants, stockbrokers and lawyers should be set on a statutory basis when they are employed by a public body.  We need a panel of such people which will be scrutinised and reviewed from time to time by the commissioners. All State and semi-State contracts and consultancies over a certain level should be allocated by these commissioners on statutory criteria which are above and beyond reproach.</P>
      <P>In view of the involvement of State-sponsored companies, a similar body should be appointed to supervise appointments to State boards.  This should include the appointment of chairmen of such boards.  There are plenty of able people in the professional and commercial life of this country who are fitted to take on these jobs.  I do not accept that there is a scarcity of such people.  A panel should be established by the Government from which selections should be made for appointments to State boards in an ordinary capacity and as chairmen.  Such a system of fair allocation of contracts and consultancies would be supervised by independent commissioners, free from Government control and interference.  That would establish confidence in the Administration. Such confidence is as important as confidence in financial matters.  All this promotes confidence in investment, which helps to deal with the job problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> No one Government are to blame for what has happened over the last couple of years.  The chairman of Greencore was appointed in 1985 by the then Fine Gael/Labour Government.  I do not want to make a point about that.  Over a number of years appointments and the allocation of contracts and consultancies have been made on a rather casual basis. Certain people have got on to the inside track in regard to these appointments. The same names and the same firms tend to come up, whether it is NCB or Investment Bank of Ireland.  It appears there is an incestuous ring of people who, on the nod, get these various positions and contracts.</P>
    <P>The only defence I have heard &mdash; and I do not accept it &mdash; is that we are a small country and only a limited number of people are capable of doing these jobs.  I do not accept that.  There is ample talent, particularly young talent, in the business and professional world who can take on the privatisation of Telecom Éireann or of any other State body if that is decided upon by the Government.  I cannot understand why, in the midst of the investigation following the Greencore matter, we had the prospect of Telecom Éireann taking on NCB and the Investment Bank of Ireland to advise them on privatisation. One wonders at the attitude of mind that dictated that decision within a few weeks of the Greencore affair.  The Minister for Communications stepped into that matter quickly after the Taoiseach had rightly spoken on the radio. The two parties concerned properly withdrew from the Telecom Éireann contract &mdash; I refer to NCB and Investment Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We know what happened in regard to Mr. Desmond and other people who rightly resigned or stepped aside depending on the phraseology one uses.  Justice must be seen to be done on a non-selective basis.  The chairman of Greencore should follow that example, as well as any other people who <Col N="842" /> were involved in practices not appropriate to their position.  That is the only possible approach.  Everything must be transparent and above board so that justice is seen to be done.  We must establish for the future a system which is fair and open, run by a permanent commission who will deal with these matters so that malpractices are at least less likely to arise.</P>
      <P>I will conclude on a point which has arisen out of the discussions which have taken place throughout the country and in this House during the past two days, that is, the need to strengthen the institutions of this country.  Let the media examine their own conscience.  We will examine our situation and whatever Government is there will do the same. We are in a working democracy and we do not want to create a mood of hysteria or start a witch hunt when problems arise. Problems arise and when they arise they should be dealt with in a rational way and a permanent arrangement established to deal with them.  We should not be engaging in the sort of vindictive debate we have seen in this House in the past two days.  There should not be the kind of vindictive comment we have seen in the media and have heard from various politicians and commentators.  I do not want to start apportioning blame.  All I am saying is that all of this does not do any of us any good.  If I am in Opposition it does not do any good to start this sort of campaign against whoever is in Government at the time.  It does not do the Opposition parties any good to take up the cudgels in this way.  Nor does it do the media any good.  It does not do any good for the morale of the public.  It does nobody any good to get into this sewer of political exchanges when the sensible thing is to acknowledge that there are problems and that these problems should be tackled in as rational a way as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At another level of public debate we have seen what has been happening in the US where undoubtedly politicians and political leaders have brought the whole system into total disrepute.  There is a witch hunt in regard to judicial appointments. God forbid that we will ever have <Col N="843" /> a system of judicial appointments here where one's past can be looked into to that extent.  That is not the way to go about business.  It has caused massive hysteria in the United States.  It has appealed to everything that is banal, trivial, prurient.  It has been a titillating exercise in which the whole of the United States has been involved trying to out-Dallas the worst in &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have been at a little bit of this ourselves in recent weeks.  The less of it we have now the better.  Let us get down to business.  This House should, tomorrow, vote confidence in the Government as an indicator from us that the Government are getting on with the business of dealing with the serious economic and social problems and of restoring confidence in the financial management of our affairs through a budget that is transparently honest next January; that in regard to the overall administration of our society here this Government are taking measures to finally bring to a conclusion the current investigations, deal immediately with the conclusions of those investigations and set up some sort of structure or structures along the lines I have mentioned to ensure that there is seen to be clear and clean Government and a certain degree of confidence in the administration for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I could agree with much of the analysis proffered by Deputy Lenihan even though some of it was a little lighthearted. However, I am afraid I cannot find any logic in the conclusions he arrives at both from a political point of view and his own personal experience with the Government he is going to support tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of this country are not looking for leadership &mdash; at least in the sense that this Government would define it.  What the people of this country want is a sense that the sacrifices they are making, and are prepared to continue to <Col N="844" /> make, are recognised, reciprocated and shared.  They want a clear and sober analysis of the challenges we face; they want a programme for action they can share in, and they want only one assurance, that every decision will be taken on a basis of fairness.</P>
    <P>On 12 July 1989 I made some remarks in this House on the formation of the present Government.  They may not have been picked up at that time.  However, as time has gone by they have been slightly prophetic.  I said that over the next months and years, two main questions would preoccupy the political system in this country, that at least the two questions ought to be among the principal issues we should deal with.  I said at the time that they may be ignored and settled by default; that it may well be that the politicians we have elected to Government will simply turn a blind eye to them, and allow them to be decided by faceless, anonymous people.  I said at that time that it would be disastrous if that was allowed to happen as it has been disastrous in other countries where it has happened.</P>
    <P>The questions were, how the fruits of economic growth would be distributed and who was going to wield the power and the influence of ownership in Ireland in the future.  I believe these are huge and difficult questions.  At first glance they are probably not the most obvious ones to mention on the formation of a Government.  However, I believed at that time that recent political experience had shown us that issues like those must be pushed to the centre of the political stage.</P>
    <P>I said that too much of our recent experience had been tied up with defending people against the callous and unthinking consequences of an ill-con-sidered approach to policy, that too much of our recent experience had been tied up with unscrambling the consequences of secret deals and political cronyism, that we could not, as a community, allow the style and substance of this kind of Government to continue.</P>
    <P>That warning I gave in July of 1989 &mdash; and I have repeated it in this House a number of times &mdash; has obviously fallen <Col N="845" /> on deaf ears.  Long before the present series of scandals this Government was run on the basis of secret deals and strokes.  We had the Foxe and Fahey deals.  We had a spate of secret reports commissioned by the Government in regard to State companies.  We have had secret agreements with beef barons as well as a number of much publicised deals.  We have had a whole series of decisions about the future of State companies, all taken and implemented with as much stealth as possible.</P>
    <P>That is one side of the coin in this country.  On the other side, we have had economic growth in the past two and a half years.  We have had more efficiency in the public service and throughout the economy.  Nobody can deny that. However, it has been built on the backs of 100,000 emigrants and a quarter of a million unemployed people.  It has been built on the backs of one million poor living below the poverty line.  It has been built at the cost of increasing inequality and disadvantage at every level of Irish society.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the increasing efficiency of our economy we have witnessed in the past two and a half years an increasing polarisation of Irish society. It is manifest in our two-tier health system, just as it is manifest in the virtual collapse of the public housing programme, the gradual elimination of free education and the dismantling of the social welfare schemes.  A more efficient economy coupled with a more unjust and less equal society is what we have begun to create in our country under the Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, opening this debate yesterday, spoke at great length about getting the fundamentals of the economy right.  I would ask the Taoiseach, are people not part of that equation?  Are they not one of the fundamentals in our economy?  Do the people count at all in the Taoiseach's economy unless they have a couple of million pounds of disposable income?  Are we not now in a clear position to see in the wealth and greed that many of these scandals have shown us just how polarised Irish society <Col N="846" /> has become.  Let us make no mistake &mdash; and this is where I differ fundamentally from Deputy Lenihan &mdash; it is no accident that there are some in Ireland who are getting rich, many more who are struggling in business and employment and thousands who are suffering the indignity and alienation of grinding poverty.  This is no accident.  All of these things are connected and the connection is to be found in the &ldquo;me first&rdquo; philosophy of which our Taoiseach is the principal champion.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget &mdash;although he himself may wish to forget at the moment &mdash; his partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats.  There may be considerable enmity between the two parties in Government at present on both a personal and personality level.  There may be a deep distrust between them, but when it comes to the ideological choices that have divided Irish society, when it comes to the connection between increasing wealth and increasing poverty, Fianna Fáil are doing no more than putting on the Progressive Democrats' ideological clothes.</P>
    <P>The late Frank Cluskey, former Leader of the Labour Party, spoke trenchantly about the Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, in the famous debate that took place in this House on 11 December 1979.  It was on the question of the agreement or otherwise of this House to the appointment of Charles J. Haughey as Taoiseach.  I should like to remind the House of some of the remarks made by the late Frank Cluskey during that debate.  He said:</P>
    <P>When we cast our minds back to the mid-sixties, we recall that there appeared on the Irish scene in the political and the business world a group of young, well-educated, very clever, highly articulate young men, who also had one other quality, they were totally ruthless and they had a clear indication of what their personal ambition was,... They had another thing in common, a philosophy of life that was dominated by the principle that the end justifies the means.  Those people, <Col N="847" /> small in number, set out to acquire great personal wealth, influence and political power.  The pinnacle of the success of their personal ambitions was during the period when Deputy Haughey occupied the position of Minister for Finance in the late sixties. The philosophy of life which those people held is also held, I believe, by Deputy Haughey.  He was the political counterpart of the group of ambitious, ruthless young men of the middle and late sixties and he was only too willing to ensure that as far as he could, by virtue of the political office he had, he would facilitate them in every way in the achievement of their ambition, the acquisition of great personal wealth, influence far out of proportion to their numbers, and the sympathetic ear of the most politically powerful men in our society at that time.</P>
    <P>Those people, with all those dubious qualifications, achieved their ambition.  They did not choose to enter into the normal business and commercial life of the country....  They chose to operate in what could only be described as a grey area of Irish business and commercial life, the area of the land speculator, the office builder, the gerry house builder.  They identified those areas as being lucrative which they knew, properly facilitated by the laws of the land, would enable them to reach their stated personal goals....</P>
    <P>A major part of the responsibility for that sad, sick part of our society can be traced back to the appearance on the Irish scene of these same young hot shots of the sixties.  The term &ldquo;mohair suit&rdquo; was not used to describe a mode of dress.  It was a term that described a philosophy of life, a philosophy of life that meant that there should be unbridled opportunity for the economically strong, the clever, the sharp; a philosophy of life that totally exploited the basic needs of the majority of our people.  Apart from the normal intelligence which most of us have, only one thing was needed,... <Col N="848" /> a total lack of principle and a total lack of either personal or business integrity. These gentlemen had all of these things and they were guided and are still guided by that same philosophy: that the end justifies the means irrespective of what the consequences are or would be upon their fellow Irishmen and women.  I say with total personal conviction that Deputy Haughey was regarded by them as their political champion and the one whose ear they had to ensure that the way was made quite clear for them to engage in that type of operation.</P>
    <P>He concluded by saying:</P>
    <P>The people about whom I spoke, the speculators, the dealers in land, the peddlers of human misery, who I believe form Deputy Haughey's main political constituency, will take great heart from his apparent election as Taoiseach in this House today.</P>
    <P>That speech was made almost 12 years ago.  It contained a sharp pen picture of the man who has been perhaps the leading politician in this country for the last 20 years, and of the culture he thrived on.  Can anyone in this House seriously deny the relevance of that picture to the debate we are having over these three days?  Can anyone in this House seriously deny that the culture of the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, of the complacent and acquiescent Governments he has led has contributed to the debasement of Irish political life in no small measure?</P>
    <P>It has been said and repeated many times that the scandals of recent weeks have nothing to do with the Government <i>per se</i>, and even that they relate to events totally outside the Government's control. I do not accept, in my humble opinion, that anyone in this House seriously believes that, and it appears that the public do not believe it.  I would say every Member of this House knows in his heart of hearts, that the seeds for all these scandals were planted on the day that the culture personified by the Taoiseach came to prominence in Ireland and that they have flourished under his leadership. <Col N="849" /> The men who operate in the grey areas of Irish commercial life still have the sympathetic ear of Ireland's most powerful politician.  That is why the scandals we have seen for the last few weeks can only be described as chickens coming home to roost.</P>
    <P>How could it be otherwise?  the Taoiseach has spent a good deal of his time in the last few weeks seeking to redefine the concept of friendship.  He devoted part of his attention to that difficult task in his speech yesterday.  But all these people are people in whose company the Taoiseach has gone to great lengths over the last number of years to be seen.  They have dined with him, wined with him, sailed with him and certainly been seen at intimate family occasions with him &mdash; they have even featured with him in some of our more prominent gossip columns, yet when the time comes they are not friends any longer.  We have seen that in relation to friends in this House.</P>
    <P>Of course, some things have changed since the late Frank Cluskey made that speech 12 years ago.  The land speculators who were prominent during those years no longer even take risks: the deals they do now are done in the certain knowledge that enough influence will be brought to bear to guarantee that those deals are profitable.  The gerry builders that he referred to then do not build anything anymore; instead they manipulate the sale of buildings in order to maximise profit and minimise tax.  The &ldquo;clever and the sharp&rdquo; do not invest their own money &mdash; instead they develop asset-backed, bank guaranteed, risk-free BES schemes. But in every other respect the culture that Frank Cluskey described then thrives now as much as it ever has, if not indeed a great deal more.</P>
    <P>I want to make some remarks in relation to the current scandals.  I recognise and hope to stay within the rules of this House in relation to the <i>sub judice</i> rule but I did notice some leeway being given to the previous speaker&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>However, whatever the constraints in the House I feel there are certain things which need to be said.  Yesterday the Taoiseach made a disparaging reference in the House to the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry, and to the role public representatives have to play in relation to that tribunal.  I want to make it very clear to the Taoiseach that I have no apology to make to him, his Government or anyone else in this House for my attendance at the tribunal and for my interest in ensuring that this Oireachtas is represented.  In fact, given the patent nonsense which is being uttered by Minister after Minister throughout this debate, the tribunal may be a far more meaningful forum than the Dáil over the next few months.</P>
      <P>When the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry begins its detailed work, if will have to examine two key questions. The first of those questions involves the issue of whether or not there has been wrongdoing within the industry itself, under a number of headings &mdash; headings like fraud and tax evasion, to name just two.  The second, and equally important issue, concerns the relationship between the beef industry and politics.  The questions raised by these issues must be answered because they go to the very heart of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> Some things are already becoming clearer. We seem to have a death-bed conversion on the part of those in authority in the wakening of vigilance.  There has been no more pathetic sight in the last few days than the sight of the Minister for Agriculture and Food proclaiming his devotion to integrity in the beef processing sector.  This Minister, who for years consistently denied even the possibility of wrongdoing in that sector for which he was ultimately responsible, has been like a whirling dervish for the last fortnight or so, even to the extent of claiming credit on the national airwaves for the establishment of the tribunal itself.</P>
    <P>I do not know for certain why he has changed his tune in recent weeks.  All I know is that this change on the Minister's part is about four years too late.  As we participate in his debate, there are gardaí on the premises of at least one meat plant that I am aware of for sure conducting intensive investigations.  But where have they been for the last four years, when every dog in the street knew there were things going on in meat plants which urgently required investigation?</P>
    <P>I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have now completely reopened their files on tax evasion in that sector and that they will ultimately be demanding many millions of pounds in extra payments and penalties, in addition to settlements already made.  But the question is: why was the file in that area ever closed?  Where has all this extra vigilance come from in the very recent past?</P>
    <P>Maybe after all this, the politicians who are now praising themselves for their vigilance and the need for vigilance will finally have the self-respect and decency to come in to this House and applogise to people, like former Deputy Barry Desmond, Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla, and others, that they maligned in this House when they rightly raised matters of criminal activity in the beef sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it you are acting under Standing Orders.  I wish to mention briefly the whole issue of Carysfort.  I tried to raise it yesterday but, unfortunately, questions are undesirable on that topic.  My colleague, Deputy O'Shea, raised the subject in this House on the day the Government were telling us how they were doing good things for UCD.  At that time the Fine Gael spokesperson on Education effusively welcomed the great deal.  The Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, attacked my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, and assured him and the House that it was UCD who had initiated the whole project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear now, as a result of the otherwise innocuous statement issued by the President of University College, Dublin, that the Minister seriously misled the House on that occasion.  It was, as we have alleged throughout, the Government who initiated that project.  The only role played by UCD was to decide whether or not to look a gift horse in the mouth.  Deputy O'Shea will deal with this issue in more detail.  There are some salient facts that must be re-stated.  First, <Col N="853" /> Carysfort could have been bought by the State for a great deal less than the State ultimately paid &mdash; perhaps for as much as £5 million less.  Secondly, it was bought without any valuation and thirdly, none of the usual procedures were followed in this case.  The Higher Education Authority were not consulted as they should have been, and none of the internal Cabinet procedures were followed.  The observations of other Departments were not sought.  In fact, I understand that an attempt was made by the expenditure division of the Department of Finance to explain to the Taoiseach &mdash; one does not tell the Taoiseach; one tries to explain occasionally, and one needs courage apparently to do that &mdash; that what was proposed was completely undesirable. That particular civil servant got short shrift, the kind of short shrift we have heard described by Deputy Seán Power when he attempted to give some of his observations to the Taoiseach at a private meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Stagg would know a fair bit about that too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We have some respect for ourselves.  We are all equal as parliamentarians: nobody is more superior than anyone else at the end of the day whether you are a Taoiseach, a Minister or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that Deputy Stagg would know more about short shrift too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the problem he had and you do not realise it.  Perhaps the most salient point in the Carysfort transaction was the beneficiary &mdash; the beneficiary whose identity has been established &mdash; Mr. &ldquo;Pino&rdquo; Harris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. &ldquo;Pino&rdquo; Harris had bought what is sometimes referred to in property circles as &ldquo;a glugger&rdquo;&mdash; a property whose value could never be realised because the zoning of that property was only for educational purposes with a limited market, a market which we had all been led to believe was starved of funds.  We have <Col N="854" /> no money for building houses, we have hardly money for buying educational facilities.  In normal commercial circumstances Mr. Harris should have taken a bath.</P>
    <P>Not only did he not have to take a loss, he ended up, after a few short months, with a handsome profit.  Interestingly, we have discovered that the day after Mr. Harris completed his transaction on Carysfort he was able to register the title deeds on another substantial property on the Naas Road.  It would be even more interesting to see how that further deal affected the capital gain liability on the profit from Carysfort.</P>
    <P>Mr. Harris has other things to recommend him, apart from his property acumen.  He too fits within most of the definitions of friendship employed by the Taoiseach.  Certainly, his very considerable resources have been placed at the disposal of the Fianna Fáil party in the past and not, in case anybody else takes umbrage, for the benefit of the party nationally.  Instead he has concentrated his efforts on helping out the party in Dublin North Central where Harris trucks have been a prominent feature of recent campaigns.  In terms of putting money on a horse, it is not a bad investment if one can get a return of £1.5 million on one property transaction.  But it does raise questions, and questions which the Taoiseach has refused to answer, in relation to his involvement in the affair.  He has chosen not to answer those questions, he has passed them on to other Ministers.  Certainly, until the Taoiseach answers those questions I will remain convinced that the Carysfort deal represented nothing more than a sleazy manoeuvre to help enrich even further a close Fianna Fáil friend.  If there was no other reason for refusing to vote confidence in this Government tomorrow, the Carysfort deal alone would constitute adequate grounds.</P>
    <P>We have had some mention of the Telecom scandal.  The scandal itself was bad enough.  I do not know what people are thinking about a country where one can make that kind of money fast, without any risk of exposure.  One of the <Col N="855" /> consequences of that scandal was that economic pressure was applied to the task of suppressing a substantial article in relation to this scene.  That article was originally to have appeared in <i>Phoenix</i> magazine.  I do not hold any brief for <i>Phoenix</i> magazine but I do take a serious view of arbitrary censorship imposed by virtue of the fact that one is economically and politically strong.  I must ask what the people behind the suppression were afraid of in that article, a copy of which I have.</P>
    <P>Were they afraid &mdash; they were &mdash; of the people of Ireland knowing the following:</P>
    <P>Details of the complex but tax `efficient' transactions on the JMOB/Telecom site in Ballsbridge which has resulted in tax-free profits of approximately £5 million to certain secret investors.  Of particular interest is the information that: 1. Michael Smurfit subscribed for £500,000 (and not £100,000 as reported) shares in UPH, the company that first acquired the site from the liquidator; 2. Larry Goodman is also a shareholder in UPH through Paribas; 3. John Finnegan, the principal in Finnegan Menton, was an advisor in the original sale to UPH (at £4.4m.) and to Telecom (at £9.4m.) only 17 months later; 4. The site had been offered to other property developers by Finnegan Menton at £2.7m. in 1988; 5. The sale to the so-called European consortium, i.e. Noel Smyth's friends, (at £6.25m.) was only fully concluded days before Telecom paid over £9.4m. for the same site; 6. The bank behind the Smyth/Doherty consortium is Ansbacher Bank.  The same bank holds a 75% interest in Doherty's Irish shopping centres.</P>
    <P>Or were they afraid that it would be revealed that UPH has two classes of shares, with Michael Smurfit subscribing for 10 per cent of both, at a total cost of £500,000 &mdash; not the £100,000 as reported elsewhere, through his Isle of Man-based Bacchantes.  Other big names, it appears from the article&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> were brought in as ordinary shareholders for a total of £1m.  Using their presence and high net worth,</P>
    <P>&mdash; a lovely expression &mdash;</P>
    <P>a further £4m. of 8% convertible preference shares were sold to the institutions. ... (Michael Smurfit's) partner in other city properties &mdash; Larry Goodman &mdash; also took a stake through Smurfit Paribas, with the institution itself also joining in.</P>
    <P>Or were they afraid that it would be revealed that:</P>
    <P>the site was bought by UPH in November 1988 but it was never owned by it because UPH transferred its interest in the contract to buy the site to another company called Chestvale Properties. Chestvale was a subsidiary of UPH and by this simple device a tax saving of almost £300,000 was made. This is because the stamp duty on property transfers is 6% but the duty on share transfers is only 1%.  When the time came to re-sell the site, UPH sold the company which owned the property (Chestvale) and not the site itself.</P>
    <P>The article went on to state:</P>
    <P>UPH only paid the liquidator a 15 per cent deposit (£660,000) and that the balance was not paid until August 1989, when the so-called European consortium paid over the first part (approx. £4 million) of their purchase price.  We can also reveal that UPH negotiated their original purchase through John Finnegan of Finnegan Menton.  The same John Finnegan &mdash; a close business associate of Michael Smurfit &mdash; also advised on the purchase of the site for Telecom.</P>
    <P>In other words, John Finnegan advised on the value of the property for the period of 17 months during which it increased in value from £4.4 million to £9.4 million &mdash; or by £10,000 per day.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why we fail to get investors into this country.</P>
    <P>The article further revealed that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> the really significant part of this transaction is the fact that the bank guarantee for the loan notes was not put in place until days before Telecom purchased the site.  Goldhawk has discovered that Ansbacher would not guarantee the loan notes until the Telecom deal was certain.  Obviously Ansbacher Bank was not willing to extend more than £4 million on the site (i.e. its real value) until there was evidence of the sell-on.</P>
    <P>This highlights the interesting fact that UPH effectively owned the site until days before Telecom purchased. The semblance of UPH not owning it was created by allowing (Noel) Smyth [Solicitor] to put his nominees onto the board of Chestvale after he gave an undertaking to put the loan notes in place.  The fact is, however, that ownership of Chestvale was not transferred to Delion until days before Telecom paid over £9.4 million on May 7th 1990.</P>
    <P>In a matter of days Delion sold the site to another company &mdash; Hoddle Investments &mdash; which is owned by property developer P. J. O'Doherty. Doherty and Ansbacher own shopping centres in Galway, Limerick and Portlaoise, with the bank owning 75 per cent in each case.  We do not know &mdash; yet, that is &mdash; how much Hoddle paid for the site.  If these people succeed in stopping the inquiry in the High Court we may never know.  It is likely that they paid a price close to what they received from Telecom.  In this way the bulk of the profit &mdash; £2.65m. &mdash; could be left in Delion for the benefit of the secret shareholders.</P>
    <P>One of the more remarkable features of the whole saga was the involvement of Mr. Smurfit &mdash; UPH investor, to the tune of £500,000, proponent of the Ballsbridge site, and chairman of Telecom.  Mr. Smurfit has always admitted that he is a details man.  New employees do not come into Smurfit's organisation without his say so and he personally approves all capital expenditure.  The things that Mr. Smurfit did not know in relation to this transaction were quite amazing.  It is also <Col N="858" /> amazing that Mr. Desmond, his executives, Mr. Barry or Mr. McHugh, or his solicitor did not inform him of what the transactions were.  At this time Mr. Smurfit succeeded in threatening a High Court writ on the <i>Irish Independent</i> because of an article they printed, and still it was not brought to his attention that he was, in fact, involved in this business.</P>
    <P>The last question in that article remains after all this has been gone through, and the taxpayer has paid about £5 million more than the site was worth.  In relation to what we know and do not know about it, somebody would say there are a lot of wonderful people in the city of Dublin &mdash; wonderful stockbrokers, bankers, solicitors estate agents, all of whom worked hard with Mr. Smurfit for 17 months just to ensure that they could hand over a profit of millions to a little fellow called Patrick Doherty in London.  That is some tale.</P>
    <P>The whole point in relation to that article was that it was suppressed.  It was not allowed to be printed in a magazine. That is as worrying as the contents of the article.  It was not printed because people in this country with economic power would not allow it to be printed.  The media were being intimidated in their attempt to investigate and report on these crucial matters.</P>
    <P>We are all in this House aware of the browbeating and bullying engaged in by members on the Government side whenever any of these issues are raised.  The subtle threats of the Taoiseach yesterday, the bluster of the Minister for Justice last night and the sly toadying of Deputy Roche are only three examples of what we have witnessed in the last couple of days.  But we in the House are relatively privileged by comparison with the media, who have been subjected to a barrage of intimidation ever since this whole saga began.</P>
    <P>That is not the first time the media have been silenced.  We saw it before and it continues.  The Taoiseach has sent solicitors' letters all over the place &mdash; letters have been sent to <i>The Irish Press</i>, and the <i>Irish Independent</i> in relation to the tribunal and there is now one in <i>The <Col N="859" /> Irish Times</i> in relation to an innocuous article on the Carysfort scandal.</P>
    <P>We all remember how a story written by a young and professional reporter in the <i>Irish Independent</i> was effectively buried for nearly two years by Mr. Smurfit's and Mr. Desmond's legal efforts.  We all remember too the numerous writs and threats issued by Mr. Larry Goodman at the height of his power.  They all have one thing in common &mdash; gagging writs, solicitors' letters, the threat of libel, defamation, and contempt &mdash; all aimed at frightening away and silencing the media. When the political and business establishment in any society has to resort to intimidation on this scale, of a supposedly free press, one has to begin to worry about the future of that society.  But that is not the only basis on which we have grounds for worry.</P>
    <P>The debate which is occupying this House for three days has been since its inception a futile and meaningless exercise because it will undermine politics and politicians in the eyes of the public. As I said on the Order of Business yesterday, we are debating confidence, or no confidence in the Government, and the question is &mdash; where are the Government? With all due respects to the Minister for the Environment, for whose presence I am grateful, it is public knowledge that the Government are engaged in negotiations behind closed doors, negotiations which up until yesterday only occupied two negotiators from each side on behalf of Fianna Fáil and The Progressive Democrats.  One now certainly gets the distinct impression that every Member of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and every Member of the Progressive Democrats Parliamentary Party, and indeed some notable outsiders from the Progressive Democrats, are engaged in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>It is verging on the theatre of the absurd for Fianna Fáil spokespersons to troop in here one after the other and pledge confidence in the Government while, at the same time, looking over their shoulders and wondering.  Some <Col N="860" /> people are starkly missing in reiterating their confidence in the Government, people who had been up front some weeks ago and were up front until the last parliamentary meeting of consequence. They are beginning to fade on the margins. Every speaker must be looking over his shoulder wondering if somebody will come down the steps of the Chamber, wondering if Deputy Brady will come in with a little note saying &ldquo;please stop speaking, because it is all over&rdquo;.  Confidence is affected by what has been happening over the last number of days. There is the clear feeling that we no longer have a Government.</P>

      <P>I will not interrupt you when you come into the Chamber to speak.  It would appear that the Progressive Democrats have not the courage to come into this Chamber.  It is remarkable, they claim to have so much power in this Government, yet they cannot come into the Chamber and make their views known.  Have they difficulty in standing in the Chamber and pledging their confidence in this Government.  There is no confidence in this Government, whether we like it or not.  Less than 30 per cent of the electorate are satisfied with the Government.  The Government parties have failed over a period of three months to put together a basic renegotiation of the Programme for Government.  How <Col N="861" /> can the public be expected to have confidence in these parties when, even after that period of three to four months, the basic premise on which their partnership should continue has not been produced?</P>
      <P>Let us recognise the serious situation facing us as a parliamentary democracy. For God's sake, let us stop harking back to the mistakes of the past.  I acknowledge that mistakes have been made on all sides.  It does not do anybody credit to blame a Labour/Fine Gael Coalition, the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey's previous Government or anybody else.  The people we represent are not interested in history lessons.  Their history is what they have to live through every day to try to make ends meet.  The people are entitled to expect hope from the politicians.  The people are entitled to demand the restoration of high standards in high places. To put it bluntly, the people want some old style patriotism.  They want people who are prepared to work for their country and community in a spirit of openness, generosity, equality and fairness.  They have not seen that in recent months.  The people are sick, angry and disturbed at what has been happening and at what has been revealed in the last number of weeks.</P>
      <P>The fact that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor has become more evident in society.  If one is in the right circle, if one has the economic power, one can do what one likes.  That is what was beginning to happen and it must be stopped.  It is all glamour and glitz on one side of the coin, millions of pounds can be made in deals overnight in the city.  The ingredients of these deals all have the familiar thread running through them, the thread of insider information, the offshore company and high tech manipulation.  That is what it has come to in the city.  They all add up to vast and fast profits without tax liabilty or any contribution to the welfare of this country or to the community, other than another triumph for the deal makers.  Of course, these people get careless, they got very casual, it was becoming so easy. This always happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> I hope we are not too late to stop the rot in society.  I hope we can bring back some decent standards to commercial life.  Needless to say, most citizens and most business people carry on business in a reasonable manner with high standards but, unfortunately, all have been tainted because of the abuse by people who felt they were above the law, people who saw Ireland as their playground for making their vast profits out of their vast deals.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is not pleasant and it is far from easy or glamorous. It is different from that described by the Taoiseach here yesterday afternoon. Things are not easy or glamorous for many people.  Unemployment is at nearly 260,000 people and we are heading for 300,000 if present policies continue. There is a growing housing crisis which perhaps the Minister for the Environment can address.  The health service are straining at the seams.  We have high pupil/teacher ratios in our schools and high unemployment among teachers. Thousands of public service workers are living on very low wages with few promotional opportunities and they are now facing further cuts in their standard of living.  Parents are struggling to meet high tax rates and high education fees and the farming community are facing their bleakest prospect for many years.</P>
    <P>These are the realities which the Taoiseach seemed to be so far away from yesterday.  I am sure that if the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, are talking to people in County Mayo and in the midlands they will be aware that people in this society are angry at present.  People have always felt that there are other people who are more privileged than themselves with access to money and power but this has to stop because people paying their taxes, and trying to educate their children and pay their mortgage do not like what they have seen in recent weeks.  What they have seen in recent weeks are people, who we have been told were successful whizz kids whom the country needed more of, making vast profits out of taxpayers money without any morality or scruples.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> The people are angry at present.  I would like to impress upon the Government that it is not the anger of envy or begrudgery but rather a genuine disbelief at the greed which has overtaken Irish society, in particular those who claim to be on the inside lane.  It is time for all of us in this House, irrespective of our political philosophy, to call a halt because Irish society and democracy and everything we would like to stand for will be under threat if this is allowed to continue. I say it is time for us as parliamentarians to restore Ireland to the people of this country, the genuine people out there who are trying to survive and make a living.  Let us get it back from the hands of those whizz kids and wheeler dealers who have brought all of us in this House to shame.  If this means the Government cannot do it and the Government have to go, so be it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has been put down by the Government to provide an opportunity for the Opposition to substantiate in this House, and before the community as a whole, the series of allegations and innuendoes about members of this Government that they have been orchestrating for the last few weeks.  The fact is, of course, that the Opposition cannot justify the rash and reckless claims they have been making.  The longer this debate goes on, the more puerile and asinine are their tactics made to appear and the more feeble and flimsy do their claims become.  The contribution of the Leader of the main Opposition party was pathetic and the other Opposition contributions have involved no more than slavishly putting on the record some of the revelations and allegations already well reported on in the media over the past number of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But then on reflection, why should we expect any better from the Fine Gael and Labour parties?  Are these not the same people who failed so miserably to deal with the problems of this country when they had their chance in Government? Are they not the same people who ran <Col N="864" /> the finances of this State into the biggest mess of all time and then ran away themselves, leaving it to us to pick up the pieces?  In short, are they not the very last people who should come in here to lecture us about conduct in Government, or responsibility in Government, or the need for effective management of the nation's affairs?</P>
    <P>The Government's record of solid achievement in fiscal and economic management is in sharp contrast to that of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties who now have an instant solution for every problem but could find none in Government, in spite of the interminable Government meetings that their memoirs are now telling us about.</P>
    <P>The remarkable feature of the last four and a half years is the fact that severe cutbacks and strict controls over public expenditure have been accompanied by the development of new policies and programmes in many areas.  Prudent use of the available resources and effective management have seen to this.  Here are some examples from my own area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>In housing we have launched the Plan for Social Housing, the most comprehensive response to social housing needs ever presented by a Government in this country and it is working.  The plan has the right mix of measures to deal effectively with the needs of those seeking social housing.  Housing has always been a top priority with Fianna Fáil but we are not locked into old style and outmoded thinking that takes no notice of changes in population, family make-up, and other demographic matters.  If the Opposition have nothing to offer but the same old tired and failed methods of dealing with housing, well Fianna Fáil have, it is in our plan and it will succeed.  The housing plan sought by Deputy Quinn yesterday will be published in the near future.</P>
    <P>On roads, State expenditure on maintenance and improvement has been increased from £166 million in 1986 to nearly £240 million in 1991.  Discretionary grants for county and regional <Col N="865" /> roads have been increased from £23 million in 1986 to £68 million in 1991 bringing the three year total to £182.4 million.</P>
    <P>Our concern for the environment is shown in the comprehensive Environment Action Programme &mdash; the first by any Irish Government &mdash; published in January 1990 and being implemented on schedule.  Under Fianna Fáil, the environment is no longer seen as a peripheral issue or even as a burden or constraint. The environment and its protection is a major part of the Government's programme. We take the balanced approach to enable economic and social development to take place while, at the same time, ensuring that such development does not have an unacceptable impact on the environment.</P>
    <P>In sanitary services, a major programme of investment over the present decade is going ahead, with a price-tag of nearly £1 billion.</P>
    <P>We fulfilled our commitment to enact major local government reform legislation in time for the June local elections and and we are committed to taking further steps in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>We have actively promoted and developed the urban renewal programme and have expanded the scheme substantially into provincial centres and additional areas in the five county boroughs. Our urban renewal programme has been an outstanding success, removing dereliction from our cities and towns, creating jobs and investment opportunities. The success is there for all to see.  It is permanent and has been acclaimed by all sections of the community and especially by our visitors and tourists.</P>
    <P>My Department's legislative programme is an impressive one.  The Roads Bill, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and the Electoral Bill are already on the Order Paper, and drafting of other very important Bills on planning and housing, to mention only two, is nearing finality.  This shows just how determined we are to press ahead with reforms, and the great regret is that consideration of these very important matters is held up by Opposition tactics of posturing and simple headline seeking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> All of this is just the beginning.  We need time to build on our achievements and to break out into a situation in which our country can enter a new phase of self-sustaining growth.  We cannot afford to be diverted by recent difficulties in the semi-State sector or elsewhere, or by the antics of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>My colleagues who have general responsibility for the semi-State bodies in question have already explained clearly the resolute action being taken to deal with the specific matters at issue. Their statements demonstrate that the Government response has been swift and effective and the House can be confident that, when the various inquiries are completed, the Government will take whatever further action is called for.</P>
    <P>It is important, however, to recognise the need for a measured, responsible and considered response.  We must not overreact and deprive the semi-State bodies of the very freedom which has been crucial for their success.  Neither do we want to create an atmosphere where people of real calibre will not wish to give their services to these bodies as directors.</P>
    <P>Let me come now to the case of the Custom House Docks Development Authority whose mandate is to secure the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks area.  It goes without saying that the chairman and ordinary members of the Authority must be persons of the highest calibre, people of experience and with particular and relevant expertise. My predecessor, John Boland, appreciated this when he appointed the first members.  They included a prominent hotelier, a partner in a financial services practice, a consulting engineer and an estate agent.  I am not in any way critical of these appointments but I want to draw attention to the fact that the people involved had, quite legitimately, a variety of business and other interests.  My predecessor obviously found it impossible to avoid this, if people with relevant experience and expertise were to be appointed.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable, of course, in such circumstances that conflicts of interest can arise.  When this happens, it is incumbent on the person involved to take no part <Col N="867" /> in the relevant decision nor to seek to influence it.  This is the normal code of ethics, well understood, and not really needing to be spelt out.  Nevertheless, to copperfasten matters, my Department wrote to the docks authority in March 1987 stressing that they should regulate their affairs in accordance with the principles and standards appropriate to a public body accountable for the expenditure of public funds; that they should be able to demonstrate, either generally or in any particular case, that appropriate standards and procedures are being applied; and that conflict of interest does not arise on the part of any member or employee in the discharge of the business of the Authority.</P>
    <P>I appointed Mr. Séamus Páircéir as chairman of the Authority with effect from 1 July 1990.  Mr. Páircéir had been chairman of the Revenue Commissioners from 1983 until his retirement in 1987. He had experience of administration and management at the highest levels in a complex area, and had an intimate knowledge of taxation practice and taxation law.  I therefore regarded him as a person eminently suitable to chair the Authority. Prior to this appointment, Mr. Páircéir had served as consultant tax adviser to the Authority and had been appointed by the Government to a representative group who were set up to promote interest internationally in the Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>Before his appointment as chairman of the Authority, Mr. Páircéir informed me, through the appropriate Assistant Secretary in my Department, of his chairmanship of UPH.  In his earlier role as consultant, he had similarly informed the former chairman and relevant executives of the Authority of his position with UPH.  Having regard to Mr. Páircéir's reputation, track record, experience and expertise, I took the view that his involvement in this company should not disqualify him from serving as chairman of the Authority.  I am happy to say that I stand over that decision.  It was made on the understanding that the usual obligations with regard to disclosure of <Col N="868" /> interests would apply, where these interests were material, and that Mr. Páircéir would, in line with accepted practice, take no part in, nor seek to influence, any decision of the Authority which might have a bearing on any interest of his.</P>
    <P>The Custom House Docks project is perhaps the single most important construction project to have been undertaken in Ireland this century.  It goes without saying that a development as important as this must be run on proper lines and that no one involved in it is seen to be associated, however remotely, with unresolved controversy even in other unconnected areas.  In his radio interview on 22 September, the Taoiseach suggested that Mr. Páircéir should temporarily stand aside from participation in the Authority while investigations were being carried out into the Telecom site controversy.  That suggestion was made without any implication whatsoever that Mr. Páircéir was involved in anything improper &mdash; indeed, the Taoiseach was at pains to stress that Mr. Páircéir was &ldquo;an impeccable man with a good, fine record in the public service.&rdquo; It was important, nevertheless, to ensure that the work of the Custom House Docks Development Authority was not adversely affected by controversy focused on particular individuals.  That is why Mr. Páircéir was asked temporarily to stand aside; he was not asked to resign. That was his own decision and it was with regret that I accepted it.</P>
    <P>The whole issue is now closed as far as I am concerned.  Tremendous results have already been achieved at the Custom House Docks and a simple viewing of the extent and quality of the development so far will confirm that. Investment is being attracted to Dublin, jobs are being created, training schemes are being run for local people, a once derelict site is being transformed.  The docks project can only be built on confidence and the Government are playing their part in generating that confidence. But the Opposition parties have equal responsibility for ensuring that nothing is done to erode confidence.  Petty small <Col N="869" /> minded muck-raking is the last thing we need &mdash; the same kind of muck-raking that Opposition Deputies have indulged in by reviving baseless allegations about the Feltrim/Kinsealy sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>Over two years ago, in response to a Dáil question from Deputy Owen, I gave a full and detailed account of all the considerations involved in my approval to this scheme &mdash; Official Report, Volume 391, Columns 282 to 284.  Deputy Owen and her colleagues had many months in which to follow up on this reply, to seek clarification of it, or indeed to challenge it.  I have seen no evidence that they did this in 1989; or that they did it in 1990; or that they did it during the first eight months of 1991.  They only decided to challenge my explanation &mdash; over two years after it had been given &mdash; because the Fine Gael leadership cynically decided to escalate the atmosphere of controversy which had arisen over other unrelated issues.</P>
    <P>Apart from being blatantly opportunistic, the allegations by Deputy Owen and others are quite without foundation. The history of the Baskin cottages and the Feltrim/Kinsealy sewerage schemes will bear this out.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council originally conceived a proposal to provide sewerage facilities for Baskin cottages in late 1973. This scheme was actually completed in the late seventies and was financed from the council's own resources.  Sewage treatment was provided by a mechanical so-called &ldquo;package&rdquo; plant, and the effluent was discharged directly into the nearby Sluice river.  In view of allegations now being made, it is important to note that the main pipes leading in to this treatment plant were of 225 mm diameter.</P>
    <P>Small treatment plants of this kind are recognised as a low cost and reasonably serviceable method of providing sanitary facilities in rural situations.  They do not, however, represent an optimum solution and it makes good engineering sense, where possible, to integrate them with larger and more serviceable treatment <Col N="870" /> facilities, which also offer operational savings.</P>

      <P>From 1979, Dublin Council began the planning of a much wider sewerage scheme generally covering an area to the north and east of Baskin cottages. Originally, this scheme was known as the Feltrim/Kinsealy cottage scheme, and it was designed to serve some 50 houses.  The scope of the scheme was revised by Dublin County Council in 1981 to cover some 78 houses.  It was revised again in 1985 to cover 90 houses, local farm requirements, Kinsealy national school and the nearby Agricultural Institute.  At this stage, the scheme had an estimated cost of over £1 million and it was also intended by the county council to cater for infill development estimated at 250 houses.  I mention these details to underline that the scheme was added to over time and that it covered rural settlements scattered over a fairly wide area.</P>
      <P>The Feltrim/Kinsealy sewerage scheme, as it had then become known, was still awaiting approval in 1987.  In that year, the basis of capital financing for sanitary services schemes was changed from loans, partially subsidised, to full State grants.  While financial and technical supervision by my Department of sanitary services schemes has always been a feature, the Department have had to develop a more active and hands-on management of the programme following these changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have fully explained in my 1989 statement to the Dáil, my Department wrote to Dublin County Council in July 1987 as part of their assessment of the Feltrim/Kinsealy proposals.  The county council were asked to have the proposals re-examined with a view to having the scheme extended to provide for the disposal of sewage from the Baskin Cottages and, possibly, other existing houses in the area.  This request was based on a number of objective considerations: capacity was then available in the Malahide treatment works to which the <Col N="871" /> Feltrim/Kinsealy scheme was to be connected; the proposed new sewer would pass very close to the outfall from the Baskin Cottages scheme; the Sluice river, the stream to which the Baskin Cottages effluent was discharged, was reported, as far back as 1974, to have very small dilutions; the discharge to the Sluice river, at times of minimum flows, would be just tolerable; and it was the general practice of the county council, where possible, to connect to a main sewer and thereby eliminate small treatment works, communal septic tanks, etc., when the opportunity arises.</P>

      <P>In relation to this last point, it is relevant to note the formal statement of drainage objectives set out in Dublin County Council's 1983 Development Plan.  These objectives were as follows:</P>
      <P>to provide or improve main drainage facilities for existing settlements where such is absent or deficient; to complete the programme of drainage for isolated clusters of council cottages...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion is now being put that the 1989 request on my Department's part represented a direction to Dublin County Council to include the Baskin Cottages in the scheme, but it was nothing of the sort.  Dublin County Council were free to consider the request at technical, administrative level and political level and to <Col N="872" /> react as they thought fit.  Having considered the question of extending the scheme at both levels, the county council decided to include in their scheme an extension to the Baskin Cottages at a cost of an additional £78,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The allegations now being made fall into two parts: that it is unprecedented for the Department to take an initiative regarding the design of a sanitary services scheme and that in this case the initiative was designed improperly to secure major benefit in terms of development capacity to the lands over which the new sewer pipe passed.  Both allegations are absurd and wholly at odds with the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> It has never been unusual for the Department to suggest improvements, whether by way of addition, modification or deletion, to local authority proposals for water and sewerage schemes.  One could cite numerous examples of interventions of this kind &mdash; the request to most major coastal local authorities to prepare proposals for secondary treatment and the request to Cavan County Council to develop tertiary treatment to help clear up Lough Sheelin are well known examples.  At the level of smaller schemes, one can instance the Department's initiative further north in County Dublin to review the separate Blackhills-Barnageeragh and Darcystown schemes with a view to amalgamation and economies of scale.  This practice applies also to water supply schemes: smaller community based schemes are frequently encouraged to connect to large regional schemes where supplies are guaranteed in terms of quantity and quality.</P>
    <P>The second element of the allegations is that the extension to Baskin Cottages could somehow confer major development potential on certain lands.  This allegation is totally unsustainable.  First, the overall Feltrim-Kinsealy sewerage scheme was never designed by Dublin County Council to provide major development capacity.  The council's sanitary services department stated from the outset that the pumps in this scheme have been designed to cater for the existing houses, plus a small amount of infill. There is no way, therefore, in which the small extension to take in the effluent from Baskin Cottages can confer a major development capacity which the overall scheme was never designed to embody.</P>
    <P>It has recently been argued that the 225 mm pipes used in the extension of themselves confer major development capacity, but this is not so.  Apart from the fact that these pipe sizes merely match those already installed during the seventies to serve the Baskin scheme, one cannot gauge capacity from pipe sizes alone.  Pump and rising main capacities, gradient and, above all, the limited capacity of Malahide treatment works, <Col N="874" /> all fundamentally limit the capacity of the overall Feltrim-Kinsealy scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are legal reasons deriving largely from the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1990, which I initiated, why land cannot be assumed to have development potential merely because of the physical proximity of sewerage services.  The 1990 Act deliberately removed the right of connection to a nearby public sewer, and it provided that non-development zoning should normally be in itself a non-compensatable reason for refusal of planning permission. The lands crossed by the Baskin sewer are zoned for agriculture and there is no proposal to change that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nora Owen has continued her snooping around the Kinsealy area, ignoring the fact that everything has been done above board and in accordance with proper technical and administrative standards.  She was a persistent advocate of the Feltrim-Kinsealy scheme since 1980.</P>

Deputy Owen should desist.  Her attitude is unworthy and not in keeping with the fine traditions of public representation in the north Dublin area.  The conspiracy theory which has been concocted around this case is simply absurd.  In no way does it square with the detailed facts which I disclosed to the Dáil in 1989 and have again set out here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the good fortune by chance this morning to hear Nell McCafferty speaking about this debate on radio.  In the course of her remarks, which, as ever, were both entertaining and astringent, she asked whether, if I <Col N="876" /> intended to speak in the debate, I would spend my time defending the record of my Governments against attacks from the other side of the House or address the subject of morality and politics.  I will not spend much time on the first issue.  A procession of Fianna Fáil Ministers and backbenchers have sought to detract attention from the real issue before us in this debate by trotting out their favourite myths about the Governments I led, myths that are half truths at best, some of them, however, departing so far from any semblance of the truth as to deserve an epithet that I am not permitted to employ by you, Sir, in this House.</P>
      <P>The simple and incontrovertible facts are that when I came into Government in June 1981 I found that the volume of public spending had been increased by almost half in the previous four years, the public pay bill had arisen by 35 per cent in the single year 1980, inflation was in excess of 20 per cent, the external trade deficit was at the horrifying level of 16.5 per cent of GNP and the Exchequer borrowing level facing us for the year ahead, had we not tackled it instantly and vigorously, would have amounted to 21.5 per cent of GNP.</P>
      <P>When I left office less than six years later, and despite the appalling damage done in the interval by the extravagant and dishonest MacSharry budget of March 1982, the growth in the volume of public spending had been reduced to 0.5 per cent, the public pay increase was down to 5.5 per cent, inflation was down to 3.9 per cent, there was a surplus of 4.5 per cent in our external trade and the Exchequer borrowing level that Fine Gael presented to the country in the 1987 election had been halved from 21.5 per cent in 1981 to 10.75 per cent.  That was the budget which Fianna Fáil adopted almost unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover the conditions for an expansion of our economy had been so well established that before Fianna Fáil were able to take any action of their own which, in fairness, they did effectively by cutting spending in the 1988 budget, the economy was growing at a rate that yielded an <Col N="877" /> increase of 4.8 per cent in 1987.  That is quite enough economics.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the question of morality and politics.  The key issue we have to face is the kind of relationship that should exist between politics and business and whether the relationship that has actually prevailed in the last couple of years has conformed to the needs of a healthy, democratic society in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Because centralised planning does not work, because the market system is essential for economic success and therefore for social progress, and because only a certain range of activities can appropriately or successfully be undertaken by the State itself &mdash; and in saying that I do not for one moment diminish the importance and value of the public enterprise activities in question &mdash; the modern world has to face the issue of the role of politics in what is necessarily a largely capitalist economic system.  Some might like matters to be otherwise, but the reality, which I, like many others who would prefer a more egalitarian society, have had to face, is that in this matter we have no choice.</P>
    <P>Moreover, given the fact that we are an intergral part of an intensely competitive world, we in Ireland have no choice but to accept and fall broadly in line with neighbouring countries in certain key respects, for example, in relation to tax rates.  While I regard as totally unsatisfactory our current marginal tax rate of 56 per cent for a worker at or under the aveage industrial wage &mdash; and I deplore the priority given by both parties in the present Government to lowering tax rates for the benefit of their better off supporters instead of raising tax bands to relieve PAYE workers of this excessive tax rate &mdash; I see nothing whatever wrong with a top tax rate of 65 per cent for really wealthy people.  But when the top rate in neighbouring Britain falls to 40 per cent, we in Ireland have no choice, if we are to retain entrepreneurs and enterprise in this country, but to go a long way towards the British figure, however much we may wish it could be otherwise.  That is why the Labour Party have now realistically <Col N="878" /> accepted a top tax rate of 50 per cent in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to ignore this question of incentives.  While it is true that in an emergency a whole nation can be got to work together in a common cause without seeking individual reward, and while it is also true that there are still many people &mdash; though fewer, I fear, than in the past &mdash; who are happy to work for their country in the Civil Service or in running State enterprises without seeking any personal gain beyond their salaries, the fact is that a very large number of people who have entrepreneurial capacity want to see a relationship of some kind between the fruits of their efforts and the financial reward they receive &mdash; whether by way of bonuses, shares or otherwise.</P>
    <P>They seek this not just for themselves but because they have the ambition to leave to their children by way of inheritance a claim on current resources in future years.  It is very difficult to provide a moral justification for transmuting a current claim on 1991 resources by X arising from his work in this year into a claim by X's son or daughter on resources produced in, say, 2010.  Indeed, so far in my life I have yet to find anyone who has been able to explain the moral basis of such a postponed claim on resources.  We may, however, also doubt the real benefit to members of a future generation of being provided with a substantial claim on current resources in their lifetime because of a parent's past achievement, for such inheritance, as we call it, can, if substantial, sometimes be a disincentive to effort and even a source of moral deterioration among those who acquire it.</P>
    <P>But the fact remains that the capitalist system, including most specifically this power to transfer a claim on resources to a future generation by way of inheritance, works by providing what is clearly a strong incentive to entrepreneurs to achieve a continual growth in total resources, and such a growth in resources provides the only solid and secure means of improving, through transfers effected by politicians, improved social conditions <Col N="879" /> for the population as a whole.  Those who will not face that fact are living in cloud cuckoo land.</P>
    <P>Those who accept and support for practical reasons this economic system have an absolute duty to ensure that the accumulation of resources in fewer and fewer hands, to which it tends to lead, is brought and kept under control.  That means that those in charge of political affairs must be willing and able to distance themselves from the system sufficiently to carry out their duty of securing a redistribution of resources and a structuring of society that will secure equality of opportunity to the maximum extent possible within what is an inherently morally problematic, capitalist structure.</P>
    <P>If politicians get too close to the enterprise sector and become too emotionally or financially involved with it, they will not be able to perform this, their morally compelling duty to society.  Let us never forget that the achievement of social justice is the only true objective of politics. The advancement of economic growth is and can only be a means towards that end and not an end in itself, as it has been elevated not merely here but in other countries like Britain in the past decade.</P>
    <P>The relationship between politics and business is thus bound to be an uneasy one.  On the one hand, if politicians are too unfamiliar with business and its legitimate needs they may perhaps unintentionally undermine the climate necessary for genuine enterprise.  They may, indeed, have to pay some attention to balancing a certain inherent insensitivity to the world of enterprise on the part of the civil servants who advise them &mdash; who themselves are and should remain very properly distanced from this world of enterprise &mdash; but the opposite danger is the commoner one, the danger that politicians may not keep themselves sufficiently distanced from business.  Where that happens great damage can be done both to politics and to business.</P>
    <P>It is clear to almost everyone that this precisely has happened in this country in the past few years.  The MRBI poll published a few days ago demonstrates <Col N="880" /> in the most emphatic way public sentiment on this point.  Curiously this aspect of the poll has attracted little attention. It shows that 74 per cent of those asked if there had been a drop in standards in Irish politics replied in the affirmative and when those who gave this answer were further asked to what extent they thought the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and his Government had been responsible for a drop in standards, no fewer than 89 per cent replied that in varying degrees they were so responsible; and the replies to a similar question about a drop in business standards yielded an almost identical answer about the responsibility of this Government and their leader.</P>
    <P>A Taoiseach and a Government who are thus judged by two-thirds of our people to have been responsible, either wholly or in some measure, for a decline in standards in both politics and business should be replaced to give Members an opportunity to purge themselves of whatever has led them to this position.</P>
    <P>These events have raised other issues. Given the appalling damage done to the public view of politicians' relationships with business, it is clear to me that the system under which political parties at present finance general elections in particular by means of contributions raised from private individuals and from business is no longer appropriate.  In the past this arrangement has stood the country in good stead.  Certainly so far as my party are concerned, under my predecessor &mdash; who warned me always to be on the <i>qui vive</i> for and to return instantly any contribution that might seem to have any kind of strings attached &mdash; and under myself and my two successors, the public interest has been protected against any influence being exercised over our decisions on issues that might affect such contributors.  But the issue is no longer whether justice is being done to the public interest but whether is it being seen to be done.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that to restore public confidence in politicians and politics, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas must in future, like members of local <Col N="881" /> authorities, declare their interest and that members of Governments &mdash; and, in the light of recent events, unhappily, perhaps, also their spouses and children &mdash; be required to furnish details of their assets, liabilities and income when in office and for some years thereafter to, I would suggest and our party suggested last November, an ethics commission comprising such figures as the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General and a High Court Judge.  There should be a provision that this commission would have a duty to investigate any allegations of non-disclosure or incomplete disclosure and when a Minister is found to have failed in his or her duty of disclosure, to publicise the result of such inquiry with a penalty of loss of office for any intentional or conscious breach of this obligation.</P>
    <P>As someone who has served in the office of Taoiseach, I want formally to ask the Minister for Finance, who will be concluding this debate, whether this Government are prepared forthwith to implement such a structure and to provide finance from public sources for political parties in order to eliminate the need for them to seek and to accept support from private sources.  I expect him to respond unequivocally to these questions.</P>

      <P>For almost two days now a motion of confidence in this Government has been debated in the House.  As yet, I have not heard anyone actually define this motion.  If we look up the definition of confidence we see that it is defined as having trust, reliance and a lack of fear.  Therefore this motion of confidence in the Government is asking me if I trust this Government, if I would rely on them or would I have a lack of fear where they are concerned.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of this House for just two years.  I have been trying, as have all Members of the House, to do my bit for my constituents, my party and my country.  However, in reviewing and assessing the performance of this Government for the past two years, and in particular the past ten months, I simply have to say that I do not have confidence in the Government.  I can no longer trust the Government.  In fact, I have no reliance at all on this Government.</P>
      <P>I ask myself: &ldquo;But how could I trust this Government?&rdquo; In many ways, it is indeed a Teflon Government &mdash; dirt and sludge may be all around it, but every effort is made at all times to ensure that none of it sticks.  We note the Taoiseach in close association with various people in the business community, apparently happy and contented with them, but when they prove to have feet of clay he steps aside from them and leaves them twisting in the wind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Big business is one thing; semi-State bodies are something else again.  It is a fact of life that Governments down through the years have staffed the semi-State bodies with people with whom they can be comfortable.  While there may be undue cronvism in that arrangement, we must all admit that it also makes sense. However, if it does make sense, the <Col N="883" /> Government cannot then have it both ways.  Either the semi-State bodies are outside their control and influence &mdash; in which case they have been failing to do their duty &mdash; or they have been party to some of the goings-on that are now causing so much disquiet.  It is simply one way or the other.</P>
    <P>I believe there is at best a moral carelessness about this Government.  Morality, the question of whether something is right or wrong, does not seem to have a very high priority with them, sadly. They stagger on from one moral crisis to another, apparently completely unaware that the cumulative effect of all of these allegations on our status as politicians is dire.  With the Rugby World Cup approaching its climax, it may be worth remembering the story of the referee who told the very small scrum-half that if he saw anyone else hit him then he would be sent off.  What had he been up to on the blind side that everybody was at him?</P>

      <P>What have this Government been up to on the blind side &mdash; that is the real question &mdash; that everybody seems to have their story of corruption in high places?  Are we to believe that the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, is the most unfortunate, the most maligned man to have ever graced this House, or is there something sinister in his make-up which attracts people of dubious moral standing to his side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at the beginning that I am proud to be a politician.  What is more important is that I want to continue to be proud to be a politician.  However, the result of recent scandals is that there is now an implication that all politicians are wheelers and dealers, and crooked ones at that.  I resent that implication.  I do not claim to be a saint, but I do claim to have moral standards, as do the vast majority of the Members of this House.  I claim that there are things which are right or wrong in themselves.  However, the result of the various scandals and the behaviour <Col N="884" /> of this Government is that the public will be led to believe that all politicians have no standards.</P>
    <P>I claim it is wrong for big business to have offshore companies that can have no purpose other than to defraud.  A money trail that leads off to Cyprus, Jersey or to a numbered Swiss bank account; surely that is a crooked road?  I believe there should be a special group in the Department of Finance that do nothing other than follow up any business or person who is discovered using offshore companies. Let this group have the resources to find out what is going on, to take action and to discover what wrongdoing is being manipulated.  We should have a Government for which words such as &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; and &ldquo;honesty&rdquo; are actually part of policy rather than simply clichés in policy documents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said yesterday that this Government were rotten to the core and should go.  I agree with him because this Government, by their recent actions, have undermined the confidence in our political system and, worse still, they are undermining the confidence and reliance in our institutions.  The result of all of that is that they have undermined the name of all Irish people at home and abroad.  That is surely a grievous misconduct of which to be guilty.  The Government have proved to be very bad managers &mdash; very bad housekeepers, in fact &mdash; and not fit to be in charge of our national finances.  All Members would agree that no household could continue to survive with a reckless, misdirected and, above all, a careless housekeeper.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot survive because they have produced a fraudulent budget.  By doing that, they have laid the basis for wrecking our national finances. Worse still, they have made commitments to the social partners that they knew they could not afford.  Surely we cannot have confidence in a Government that perform in that way.  Thankfully, recent polls show that the public will no longer tolerate such behaviour.  The people are angry; they are embarrassed; they are appalled by the behaviour of the <Col N="885" /> Government.  What must be realised is that what we say here as public representatives is what the people outside are saying.  The Government's response to the recent scandals has been to provide investigation after investigation.  Yes, they have been putting off the day of reckoning for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>It is true and we must accept that the budget strategy has collapsed and that no steps have been taken and no efforts have been made to put anything else in its place.  There is no accountability.  The Government show little concern about what is happening today.  Their only reaction is to ensure that all the mud will stick to other people, but we are not prepared to put up with that.</P>
    <P>The sale of Carysfort College is an example of the way in which the Government work.  It is now obviously good Government policy not to buy when property is cheap but to wait until it is really expensive.  Can we expect the people of Ireland to allow a Government that behave in that way to continue?  How can I go home to South Tipperary and expect the people of Cashel, who have been waiting for ten years for their community school because no finances were available, to accept that response when millions of pounds were available to buy Carysfort College when it suited the Taoiseach and the Government?  How can I expect the teachers in our small rural schools who are waiting for extensions, trying to teach in conditions completely non-conducive to teaching, to believe that the Government have their interests at heart when they have failed to provide just a few thousand pounds to effect much-needed repairs?  Those are the questions the people in my constituency are asking.  They are questions for which I cannot provide an answer.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government have lost the ability to run our nation.  They have lost the confidence of the farmers, they have lost the confidence of the unemployed, they have lost the confidence of the public sector, they have lost the confidence of the entire business community and they have also lost the support of many of their own members.  In fact, the <Col N="886" /> Government have lost the confidence of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I repeat I cannot support this motion of confidence.  The behaviour of the Government is, I sadly say, in danger of making me ashamed of being a politician.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to make a few general observations about the current controversies, then focus specifically and, of necessity, briefly on aspects of the semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>In every democracy the electorate must have confidence in the organs of the State, in their elected representatives, in the courts and in the administration of justice.  If that confidence is eroded people lose faith in democracy and can quickly become apathetic or cynical, which we must always be vigilant to prevent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that recent events have occurred in both the public and private sectors which give us reason to worry about standards in Irish business. In relation to the semi-State bodies it is the specific responsibility of Government, and the relevant Ministers, to act swiftly and decisively to allay such worries. They have done so in establishing the various investigations and inquiries. The inquiries now under way must ensure that any illegalities or malpractices will be uncovered, disclosed and dealt with decisively and fairly.  Where wrong-doing occurs it has to be uprooted and tackled on the spot.  That is the only way trust and confidence in the financial and business field can be restored.  It does seem that sufficient things have happened in the recent past to increase our concern and determination to put things right. However, we must not get caught up, wittingly or unwittingly, in the process of character assassination.  It is particularly incumbent on public representatives to <Col N="887" /> back up whatever they say and not say things merely for political gain.</P>
    <P>Turning to the semi-State bodies, I want to comment on the composition of boards and on the issue of control and regulation.  I commend the Minister for Finance on setting up the study under the Secretary of his Department on the principles governing the relationship between the Departments of State and State bodies.  That is especially timely at present.  Likewise, I commend the promptness with which the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications responded to the troubling disclosures in bodies under his control.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging and indeed condemning the recent scandals it must be said that the great majority of State-sponsored bodies have done a very good job in recent years in very difficult trading conditions nationally and internationally. It should be remembered that these bodies are among the most significant employers in the country, employing almost 100,000 people.  Most of them are employed in commercial State-sponsored bodies and have made a vital contribution to the life of our economy over the years. From my contact with these boards, as a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies for several years, I have the greatest confidence in the great majority of the management and workers in those enterprises.  I emphasise that we should not tarnish either the State bodies or their employees because of the improprieties committed by a few people in them.</P>
    <P>The scandals are harmful; there is no getting away from that.  They damage the very fabric of our society and, in particular, affect our commercial credibility in the international marketplace. However, for the time being, in all fairness, we must await the outcome of the various investigations that are under way. The normal practice, based on many years experience of successive Governments as regards the relations between commercial State-sponsored bodies and the relevant Ministers, is that the Government appoint boards of directors who are <Col N="888" /> given a considerable measure of freedom in the management of the relevant companies. The level of independence enjoyed by these companies, of course, has to be consistent with legislation and considered appropriate to the task to be undertaken.  In practice this means that commercial semi-State bodies would not normally need to consult with or obtain the approval of Government Departments for individual commercial decisions unless there were major strategic implications or specific Exchequer requirements.  Therefore, Government Departments should not, except in very exceptional circumstances, be involved in any day-to-day decisions of semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>Turning to the directors of these semi-State boards, there is a clear obligation on any relevant Minister, and the Government, to ensure that qualified and experienced boards of directors are appointed.  The boards of commercial State-sponsored bodies operate in varying degrees in the open market.  Obviously, to compete effectively, the boards of such companies must be allowed freedom, within policy guidelines, to manage their companies.  However, the crucial issue is to have people appointed to boards with the appropriate qualifications and experience.  Normally, executive directors have these characteristics and fulfil those requirements.</P>
    <P>I specifically want to address the question of the non-executive director, whom I suggest must have the same qualifications and experience if such people are to make the necessary and relevant contribution to board deliberations.  Therefore, there is a real need to review the quality of appointments in relation to non-executive directors of State enterprises.  Properly qualified non-executive directors can greatly assist a company.  They can also provide an element of control on behalf of the shareholder, in this case, the Irish public and taxpayer, over a company's management.  If we are to have effective boards of directors these appointments should be based on the qualifications and experience of the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> Membership of a State board is, and should be, for many a form of practical patriotism.  However, the directors' fees for such board membership generally are derisory, ridiculously low.  Indeed, I suggest there is an urgent need to review these fees to bring them even slightly closer to directors' fees obtaining in the private sector.  This remuneration argument applies to full-time executives as well as non-executive directors.  There are many examples of senior, full-time executives in the semi-State sector whose remuneration &mdash; where it follows the recommendations of the Gleeson Commission &mdash; does not realistically compare wih the going rate in the private sector. Furthermore, we cannot reasonably expect senior and experienced businessmen to take on the onerous duties, if they are to play a full role, of the non-executive director especially since the enactment of the Companies Act, 1990, places considerable controls on their behaviour and performance.  We cannot realistically expect people of this stature to give sufficient time to the State body concerned if they continue to receive the nominal payments made to non-executive directors at present.</P>
    <P>We must not be naive.  By and large these are very substantial commercial enterprises, big businesses.  We must have men and women appointed to boards with wide experience of the tough and practical side of business.  We must trust these people to do the right thing. In a country as small as ours there is an absolute need to be frank, forthcoming and open as conflicts of interest must be resolved almost on a daily basis. However, if any wilful wrong-doing occurs in a State company then action must be taken after calm and realistic examination.  There should be no preemptive public hangings.  However strongly we may feel about a matter we must examine it fairly and equitably.</P>
    <P>There have been calls for a code of ethics for board members and guidelines on proper conduct.  As somebody involved in business education for many years, I fully support the inclusion of courses on ethics &mdash; they are there already &mdash;<Col N="890" /> in the course of business education.  As experience has shown many of those who go through the educational system will progress to board membership.  Such codes of ethics, desirable as they are, do not entirely tackle the issue of morality. The bottom line in relation to morality will stand or fall on individual honesty. Therefore, we can have codes and guidelines but, at the end of the day, we are back to the integrity of individuals on such boards and elsewhere.  The crucial thing is to have people serving on boards, to put is simply, who can distinguish between right and wrong and be of high probity and wide experience.</P>
    <P>There is the further vexed question of whether additional legislation and/or regulation is desirable in the case of semi-State bodies.  In posing this question we must be mindful that controls are already in place.  Commercial State-sponsored bodies are subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, and the recently enacted Companies, Act, 1990, with some exceptions.  These Acts, in particular the Companies Act, 1990, have very stringent provisions for controlling and regulating the activities of companies and, in particular, their directors.  Specifically, there are stringent requirements on directors to declare their interests in transactions, including property transactions. It should be said that the transactions which are currently the subject of investigations occurred prior to the enactment of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>The balance which has to be struck between protecting the interests of the State shareholders, the public, while at the same time providing legislative changes and/or intervention that will allow a strong commercial State sector to develop is a key question and it requires careful focus and attention to get the balance right.  There is and must be &mdash; and this is practical patriotism &mdash; a very close working relationship between business and politics in the common interest of the development of economic activity which will benefit people in terms of jobs, etc.  It is a fact that in Ireland Government and Government bodies are commercially and socially involved in an <Col N="891" /> enormous range of activities that touch on all our lives.  One of the more recent examples of this contact, this joint approach between Government and business, was the leading by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of a trade delegation to the Baltic countries to develop trade with this country, which in turn should lead to jobs we so badly need.</P>
    <P>In terms of the review of legislation, I am aware that the Minister for Finance's group is already deliberating.  I want to make a few suggestions in this regard. There could be a requirement on boards of directors to demand and to ascertain, in so far as possible, the beneficial ownership of the vendor or purchaser of an asset to or from the company.  The second point is that the requirement on directors to provide details of any beneficial interest in contracts, including in particular the acquisition or sale of property or shares in another company, could be extended to the requirement that the directors make a declaration, whether it be positive or negative.</P>
    <P>I welcome the current review of guidelines on public procurement, which will identify whether any improvements need to be put in place so that any further guidelines established do not inhibit the efficiency and cost effectiveness of commercial operations.  We must certainly improve the guidelines in relation to public procurement but not in a way that would stultify commercial operations.</P>
    <P>Against the background of policy guidelines laid down by relevant Government Departments, the boards of these companies must be allowed to manage their businesses without undue interference. The directors of semi-State companies must be properly qualified and realistically remunerated.  The Companies Act, 1990, significantly enhances the regulatory environment and in particular the controls over directors.  This applies to many of our commercial semi-State companies.  Further consideration could be given, however, to providing legislation and/or guidelines, particularly in relation to disclosure of directors' <Col N="892" /> interests, of parties in sales or acquisitions, and penalties for non-disclosure. Any malpractices which are uncovered or disclosed following investigations must be followed by appropriate and decisive Government action.  We in the Oireachtas must do all we can to support in a positive way the development and management of the commercial State sector so that it is in a position to compete in the open market and create the jobs we so badly need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Any objective comparison based on the performance of this Government and previous Administrations of which Opposition parties were members, with the exception of The Workers' Party, will show quite clearly on any of the economic criteria that the performance of Fianna Fáil led Administrations has been far superior to the performance of those Administrations in which Opposition parties have participated. For that reason alone it is quite clear that the best available Government is on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I should like to direct a few points to my junior partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats.  This Government are proceeding on the basis of the Programme for Government, 1989-1993, called <i>In the National Interest.</i> Deputy Spring this morning and yesterday sought to give an impression that there is no programme available to this Government on which to do the nation's business. This is the programme.  The programme provides for a review mechanism after two years and thereafter annually.  Under all the headings there has been substantial progress.  There has been progress in terms of competition law, commercial State enterprises, tax reform, public finances, the needs of the lower paid, indirect tax harmonisation, the health services and great improvements under the social welfare heading which are in excess of inflation, special measures for the unemployed in urban disadvantaged areas, and in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been the setting up of the Environment Protection Agency, and we have started on local government reform. <Col N="893" /> We have brought in legislation on planning compensation.  Environmental impact assessments are essential before permission is given for mining.  The sum of £3 billion is being distributed from the European Structural Funds under various headings.  In agriculture there is a review of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  We have increased headage grants and there are new appeals systems. Off-farm income limits in disadvantaged areas are no longer taken into account.  There are major developments in the forestry programme and in fisheries.  Tourist numbers have doubled since 1987.  We have brought in air transport liberalisation, and regional airports have been developed.  There are new rural tourism schemes.  We have seen energy proposals and new transport legislation has been promised.  Substantial progress has been made in relation to the agreed Programme for Government.  It is within that overall framework that the review mechanism operates.  It is also in line with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which has to be reviewed now in view of the fact that the growth rates which were assumed have to be reviewed due to the international trading position.</P>
    <P>This is the way politics are carried on in this country.  Agreed programmes are drawn up, in this instance by two individual parties who form the Government and implement policy.  It is expecting a little too much of me as a member of the major Government party to expect that we are going to change the framework in any way.  We are interested in doing business on the basis of this programme. If they are not interested, frankly we are not interested.  There is no way in which a junior partner in Government will dictate fundamental fiscal policy.  They can contribute and make an input but anyone who thinks that this party, the biggest party in the State, is to be dictated to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that the Fianna Fáil programme, most of which is contained in the Programme for <Col N="894" /> Government, will be implemented, if they are interested in doing so.  If they are not interested, we can have a general election.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed that not one of the Progressive Democrats in the backbenchers has come in to say what contribution they have made to the implementation of this programme.  I understand the Ministers are coming in tomorrow.  That is a major disappointment to us on the Government side.  For the past two years I have listened with interest to Progressive Democrat Ministers and backbenchers stating how much they have been contributing to the successful implementation of this programme.  When it comes to confidence motions there seems to be a very strange reticence on the part of our junior partners.  I do not find that acceptable. We are here in good faith to provide a Government for this country.  We are not in a game playing exercise.  We are not going up to the wire for the sake of the media circus that has been going on for the past ten weeks.  We are here to do business and we are entitled to expect our junior partners in Government to come in and express confidence in this Government in terms of the implementation of the programme thus far.  If they wish no longer to remain in Government, that is totally a matter for them.  We are not here to be dictated to inside or outside this House.  We are here in good faith.  We respect our partners in Government once that respect is reciprocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This party will not be kicked about by anyone.  Those who bluster and make unfounded allegations, who seek to politicise financial scandals, will find it will not work in terms of how we approach our programme as long as this Government continue.  As the programme states, it is in the national interest that we have a continuation of the present Government. We are anxious to continue and to re-establish the good terms necessary for any Government to function effectively. We are willing to do so.  We are not in the business of playing economic poker with the interests of the Irish people. Let us make some decisions and let us <Col N="895" /> proceed.  I look forward to some Progressive Democrat backbenchers coming into this House and standing up for the Government they supported.  We supported them in Government and we are entitled to some reciprocal support. Their reticence here is, frankly, disappointing.</P>
    <P>We have to listen to right wing economic Rasputins outside the Four Courts and elsewhere dictating to us about dishonour in the implementation of our programme. We are discharging our collective responsibility.</P>
    <P>In regard to the scandals that have taken place in the last few weeks, I want to put it on the record of this House that every decision that was taken in relation to those matters was a Government decision.  The Government are committed to full disclosure, full investigation and full follow through in regard to those who have committed any wrongdoing. There is a constitutional obligation of collective responsibility and we must meet that responsibility when a charge is made.  All the decisions that were made were Government decisions.  We are anxious and willing to bring transparency into this aspect of our Government dealings so that the wrong-doing, if any, in relation to these matters will not happen again.  We need no lectures from anybody in this House about our morality, our uprightness, our steadfastness or our integrity.  We need no lectures from anybody about what is right.  Our performance in Government over the years shows where this party stand and why we have the support we commanded through successive elections.  We will re-establish and reaffirm the fundamental basis upon which this party was built.  We need no lectures from anybody inside or outside this House on that matter.  It is very difficult to take from some quarters and I am looking at a particular party in that respect.</P>

      <P>In regard to emigration, we have emigration. Deputy Garret FitzGerald on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last Monday, at least had the honesty to put it up to every politician not to be dishonest on this issue.  It is a symptom of a problem that arose under their Administration as well as ours.  The bottom line in regard to the success or otherwise of a Government in terms of job creation is how many more people are at work in this country under this Administration than was the case before.  The one indicator that Deputy FitzGerald did not mention here this evening was that under his Administration there were 66,000 fewer working in 1987 than in 1982.  That is a fact. More people are working under this Administration than worked in 1987, and that is a fact.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to muck rake.  Indeed, I had a rare experience today to do with two people in my constituency to whom I spoke about an article that is being done about the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I think I surprised them by describing him as an honest, co-operative, old-fashioned, honourable gentleman.  I would say the same of my other constituency colleague, Deputy De Rossa, whose party has come in for extraordinary attack in this debate.  It is only by the way I say that, but I have shared a constituency with Deputy De Rossa for the 12 years I have been in politics and I must say, in the context of the accusations, there is no doubt about his origins, there is no doubt about his period in prison, there is no doubt about where he started from as there is no doubt about <Col N="898" /> where Fianna Fáil and our party started from.  Certainly in my experience Deputy De Rossa has been consistent and honourable in his opposition to provisional violence on the ground.</P>
    <P>At public meetings where we have seen the Provisionals, Sinn Féin and other groups trying to get a hold on our community, he has fought it on every level. As far as I am concerned, if ever asked, I take this opportunity to say that because the allegations being made seem to be part of the smokescreen from the other side throwing as much dirt around as they can.  It is seen for what it is, a smokescreen. They have tried to cast dirt in every direction.</P>
    <P>This is a two sided debate.  The issues are confidence in the Government, in their performance, and the question of the scandals.  I intend to concentrate most of my contribution on the scandals, what they have meant to this country and what we need to do in relation to them.  The issue of confidence has been dealt with substantially by our party leader and the substance of his contribution I would endorse 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen said that the performance of all Fianna Fáil Governments was far superior to any other.  The performance of Fianna Fáil Governments, the ones I have watched, have left a number of questions and can be criticised on many fronts.  Remember the GUBU period?  I would also point out the problem we inherited in 1983 when inflation was over 20 per cent and I was briefly in the Department of Social Welfare.  In that year we had to increase social welfare payments by 25 per cent so that people could have a 2 to 3 per cent increase in real terms because inflation was rampant.  Interest rates were at an all time high.  At the end of our period in Government they were both down to the levels they are currently at.  The huge juggernaut of increasing debt and increasing expenditure had been halted <Col N="899" /> and the stage was set for further improvements with the continuation of the policies we had established.  A great deal of work was done.  More would have been done, too, had we had a more obliging Coalition partner, and Fianna Fáil know the problem with that.  There was difficulty there but a great deal was achieved.</P>

      <P>I am sure it was honest. It may have been honest.  I really cannot analyse the Taoiseach's mind.  I never could, I cannot now.  The Taoiseach's speech yesterday was extraordinary in the extent to which it was out of touch. He effectively said there was no problem and that this was all due to Deputy John Bruton, in particular, stirring up things. We all know that that simply is not the case.  Anyone who moves outside the four walls of this House and circulates in society knows there is a remarkable level of shock and disillusionment among the public in reports to our semi-State sector and our politicians.  The public have been steadily losing confidence in politicians over the past two decades but this disillusionment has spread much wider and people have now lost faith in public institutions. These issues have still not been resolved.  I should say at this point that I would like to share my time with my colleague.  Deputy Durkan.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's response to restoring public confidence is to simply say that this lack of confidence is not warranted, there is no crisis and the Opposition are simply playing games. The Taoiseach is seriously out of touch with reality and someone should have a chat with him.  He is out of touch on his <Col N="900" /> island, his palace and country estate with what people are saying.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party did not invent the events of the past few weeks.  I remember when these issues first arose.  They started on 1 September when the Sunday newspapers reported that Chris Comerford was taking a legal action to recover millions of pounds which he believed were his arising out of various deals in which he was involved during the period he was chief of a semi-State company.  In one fell swoop that revelation said 100 things to me and the average Irish person, for example, that semi-State companies were not what we thought they were, semi-State company employees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

I understand a legal case is threatened.  I know the Deputy will temper her comments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the extent of my reference to it.  That revelation simply indicated to me that semi-State companies and semi-State company employees were not what we had generally thought and expected them to be.</P>
      <P>It also made me wonder if I was something of a fool trying to live on a Dáil salary of £27,000 which, in Irish terms, is quite generous but which, when compared to the figures which were mentioned and not contested &mdash; I accept that certain legal elements have to be decided &mdash; seems like peanuts.  Within a week of that revelation we had the revelation in relation to Telecom Éireann.  To somebody of my background &mdash; a politician for 12 years and before that a school teacher who had a modest north side upbringing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;these revelations <Col N="901" /> disclosed unheard of possibilities in the creation of companies, avoidance of tax, shelf companies and foreign bank accounts.  The week those revelations were made housekeeping work was being carried out in this House &mdash; workmen were laying carpets after cleaning them and painting the walls.  I felt ashamed to walk by these people who probably earn £120 to £200 per week.  The people who are being asked to live on these amounts and who have to support families need to have these issues aired and resolved.  I accept that these issues can never be resolved totally, we will never live in a perfect society.  I am not saying all the good is on this side and all the wrong is on the other side.</P>

      <P>However, we must all acknowledge that there is a very serious problem.  By pretending that there is not a serious problem, the Government are doing a disservice to themselves, a serious disservice to society and failing to act as proper public representatives.  The public are appalled and shocked at these revelations.  They still do not fully understand them and they cannot see them being taken on hand and resolved.</P>
      <P>Following those revelations there were further allegations in relation to Bord Gáis Éireann, Irish Helicopters and Carysfort College.  Very little has been done to put these issues right.  There is an interesting definition in <i>The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought of the word</i>&ldquo;elite&rdquo;.  I think some of our problems stem from something associated with this concept.  It states that the word &ldquo;elite&rdquo; is a &ldquo;collective noun for those who occupy a position (or positions) of superiority within a society or group by virtue of qualities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It refers to the elite as distinguished from the non-elite groups within a social order and the divisions within the elite as between a governing elite and non-governing elite.  It also states that one of the interesting things about an elite is their relationship to the ruling classes.  I believe an elite group have grown up in our society.  One of the good things to have come from this is an elitism based only on the capacity to make money.  We tolerated its growing arrogance and exclusiveness because we thought (1) that there were no questions about its legality and (2) it would be of benefit to all our society.  Indeed, we recruited &mdash; I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; because we accept some of the responsibility &mdash; some of these captains of industry because we thought, as we all did in relation to the Taoiseach, that a man who could make money for himself could make money for the country.  One of the lessons we have learned from these revelations is that the ethics of private business and the ethics of public life are very different and that it is at great risk to many things that we merge the two.  I should like to welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, to the House.  Is this a sign of agreement, white smoke?</P>

      <P>These issues will be of great importance for whatever Government are in power in the weeks ahead.  If we get the changes we are looking for, hopefully these issues will be addressed more urgently.  We must seriously consider returning to our traditional view of the public service.  We must also consider the appropriateness of the personnel appointed and the ethics, standards and attitudes to which we are giving lip service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> As I said there has been a growth of arrogant, ostentatious wealth and exclusivity. The Taoiseach spoke of guilt by association.  I do not wish to be personal, but the Taoiseach's lifestyle &mdash; his palace, island, helicopter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is yachting in Ringsend so I will allow him reasonable liberty.  Serious questions need to be answered.  Because there is no requirement for a register of interests for public servants or the source of the wealth of somebody who has been in public life for a number of decades many questions now need to be answered.  Even the dogs in the street are saying that these scandals go to the top.  This is the public perception and people need to be reassured if we want to restore their confidence in public life.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to another point which niggles me &mdash; the development of the K Club, whose affiliation fees are kept as high as is possible so that the club can be more exclusive.  This is something new in Irish society.  We always had wealth, but we had people who knew how to carry it and did not parade it, and who did not have to find new ways of making themselves more distinguished, different and separate.  I think some good could come out of this if we called a halt to all these excesses and said that as public representatives we have different standards which must be maintained.  Much of what Deputy G. FitzGerald said was extremely important, that business and politics can get too close, resulting in serious damage to both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ethos of private business carried into public life does not mix easily and it is an experiment we should seriously question on all sides of this House.  All of us &mdash; left, right and centre &mdash; were involved in developing too close a relationship with the best of motives in mind.  That is nothing new in the world. <Col N="904" /> A very serious credibility gap exists.  I gather that that term was first used in the United States in the period of President Johnson where both during his campaign and later on there was growing doubt and cynicism.  An aide said the credibility gap was getting so wide that they could not believe their own leaks.  The most serious problem, they said, was that there was widespread doubt in the public mind about their major leaders and institutions. Regrettably, without pointing the finger, that is where we are now and what is required is that confidence should be restored.  It is important that we as politicians state some idealism because what is being hit most in Irish society is any confidence in ideals or in idealistic aspirations in public life.</P>
    <P>In 1807 Thomas Jefferson said that when a man assumes a public trust he should consider himself as a public property. It is clear that those who took on public trust recently have not operated in that fashion.  A man who has the confidence of the public, has a public trust not to abuse that confidence for any ends, let alone his own.</P>
    <P>It is important that if we are to restore public confidence there should be action. The action should include rigorous pursuit of the matters under investigation, reform of the Companies Act, which is already seen to be inadequate; establishment of a code of conduct for all members of Government, Members of this House and for workers in semi-State bodies who are senior employees and board members; committee structures of the House should be established to supervise and monitor adequately every area &mdash; we are a wasted resource in that way &mdash; and the issue of funding political parties should be considered.  I try to avoid demagoguery here or the hitting at soft targets.  The final approval of the people is given not to demagogues and, as was said by another American leader, slavishly pandering to their selfishness, merchanising for the clamour of the hour but to statesmen administering to their <Col N="905" /> welfare, representing their deep silent abiding convictions.  What the Irish people wish is some restoration of confidence because none of us is happy living in a society that we believe to be crooked and corrupt.  Action is needed; I believe a change in Government is needed to achieve that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this motion of confidence put down by the Government, which arose directly as a result of Fine Gael putting down a motion of no confidence in the Government, one would have to have regard to the manner in which the Government addressed the issue.  Over the last few days one could not but be surprised at the manner in which some Government spokespersons addressed the issue in hand and, far from enhancing any public confidence in Government, they went the other way. Speaker after speaker seemed to have decided to dig down deep in the hope of eventually striking something which was akin to oil but not of the same texture and have repeatedly attempted to throw mud across the House in the hope that the whole purpose of the exercise on the motion of confidence in the Government would be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was capped entirely this morning by Deputy Roche who probably saw himself as a latter day Sherlock Holmes, having spent a considerable amount of time, laboriously digging into the archives to find something which he could hurl across the floor in the hope that somebody somewhere might decide that it was in some way unethical.  He probably landed himself with the tag, not of Sherlock Holmes but of Inspector Closeau, who used to be portrayed by the late Peter Sellers and who did not necessarily always come up with the result he desired.  I think he also resembled the boy at school whom the teacher had ignored for some time and who hoped if, perhaps, he was able to bring in sufficient apples or goodies he would be noticed when the next round <Col N="906" /> of promotions came up.  I am sorry to say he failed miserably and only exposed himself as a very small minded, bitter and disappointed person.</P>
    <P>The motion we are now discussing stems from more than the issues that have been debated publicly over the last number of weeks.  It stems also from public confidence, the confidence of the people in Government and the confidence of business in Government.  The question has already been referred to by my colleague Deputy Garret FitzGerald, that in a recent poll public confidence in Government is waning, and is waning fast for a number of reasons.  It would appear that Government are told what to do on a regular basis by some people who are actually outside of this House.  That is not something that would enhance public confidence.  The other thing that has occurred again and again over the last couple of years in the life of this Government is that at every sign of a crisis there has been a meeting within the two camps of Government and there has been a crisis within a crisis where one has said they will, they will not, maybe, perhaps. That is the story of this Administration over the last couple of years.  There is no indication that they will continue in any different fashion from that which has prevailed for the last couple of years.  The suggestion of no confidence is well founded, as there has been an abysmal failure from that side of the House to engender any kind of confidence into the debate or to encourage public following of their particular parties.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I would like to refer to one issue which is of major importance in ensuring that State and semi-State companies and business generally are accountable so far as they can be to this House but with particular reference to the State and semi-State companies.  How often have we put down parliamentary questions in this House to be told, on the one hand, that they are to be transferred from one Minister or <Col N="907" /> another or, on the other, that the Minister has no official responsibily to the House?  This is not a reference to the Ceann Comhairle's office, it is an accepted practice and a wrong practice in my view.  How else can public representatives be answerable to our constituents unless we have the right to put down parliamentary questions asking about any issue under the sun which is pertinent to a particular Minister's responsibility?  A Minister may consider himself &mdash; or herself, as the case may be &mdash; glib and smart, though I wish to state emphatically that this does not apply to all Ministers.  There are some Ministers who are particularly good and forthright in answering questions.  There are others, unfortunately, who will use that escape clause again and again to get away from answering directly.  The one thing that always happens to such people is that they get caught themselves.  If they do not seek the information in order to accommodate the Opposition, the particular individuals in the Departments concerned fully recognise that they will never be questioned anywhere.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the fault is with the inability or the unwillingness of some Ministers to give clear answers to specific questions in this House.  If they could mend their ways in that direction it would be a great help to this House and would be of greater assistance to themselves and of far greater assistance in encouraging public confidence in Government.</P>

      <P>Any fairminded person would have to agree that certain members of the Opposition have grossly abused their position of privilege in this House in the manner in which they have <Col N="908" /> hurled accusations against people outside the House without any evidence.  That is reprehensible and calls into question the limits to which this privilege can be allowed.  As Deputy Dermot Ahern said earlier, the matter must be addressed.  It is outrageous and it flies in the face of common justice that accusations of criminal behaviour can be made against people who are not in a position to defend themselves. Too often these Deputies when asked to repeat their allegations outside of the House have refused to do so because they know they are without foundation and would not stand up in a court of law.</P>
      <P>The main culprits in this area have been The Workers' Party.  It is unfortunate that The Workers' Party, who apparently stem from the criminal activities of the Official IRA and who have had certain links with the disgraced communists of eastern Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the media have again leapt in to exploit the situation. Last week some of our national newspapers were filled with this type of claptrap. The financial pages stated that damage had been done to investment from abroad by the news from Ireland. Who informed them?  Was it the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>, which printed a photograph of the head of Government in the front page and audaciously used words from a Shakespearian play &mdash;&ldquo;Something Rotten&rdquo;.  If one looked down the rest of <Col N="912" /> the page there was noting in the article to back up the headline.  This is what is going on in this country at the moment. Fianna Fáil have had to endure a violently hostile press from the day they were founded but invariably the public have had the good sense to overcome gutter journalism before making their decision.</P>
    <P>Within the past number of weeks I have severely criticised several commentators and newspaper editors for the manner in which they behaved during these events.  One radio interviewer asked me if I was not being paranoid about the media.  That could not be further from the truth.  I have been very careful to distinguish between good investigative political journalists and those so-called commentators whom I have described as muckrakers.  To call them journalists would be a smear on that noble profession.  The high priest of these commentators is a man who failed miserably in his political life, after one term failing to get re-elected.  This individual has been afforded massive space on the leader page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> for years now to spew out his obvious hatred for Fianna Fáil, and for one person in particular, Deputy Charles Haughey.  I quote from his recent piece. It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>I shall not believe Mr. Haughey to be politically dead until I see his body buried at midnight at a crossroads, with a stake driven through his heart.</P>
    <P>This is one example of impartial, objective journalism.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> actually describes that journalist as one of our top commentators.  The other top commentator usually takes up the space immediately below him and he is rapidly learning from his master.  Added to this type of venomous article is the use of outrageous headlines.  Take, for example, the report on the beef tribunal. The eminent chairman of the tribunal used stronger words than those I used. He said they were an absolute disgrace. <Col N="913" /> At least I am not alone in my opinion of that section of the media.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Security on this island demands the co-operation of the security forces on both sides of the Border if we are to root out those people who cause so much trouble, destruction and death on this island, in particular in Northern Ireland.  However, I believe the British Army are going too far in closing this Border crossing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As someone who uses this crossing very frequently I can tell the House that when the barriers were being constructed passersby laughed with amusement. Whose idea was it to put poles across the road to stop passing traffic during certain hours of darkness and the day?  The only conclusion I can come to is that faceless people in Whitehall, in the belief that they had the answer to the war against subversion in Ireland, decided this was the way it should be done.  It is akin to Checkpoint Charlie, which divided the city of Berlin, between Lifford and Strabane.  As someone who grew up in the town of Lifford, unfortunately I have to say that the people of Lifford, County Donegal, can travel the length and breadth of Europe without being stopped, indeed, they can go as far as Moscow, but they cannot go to Strabane.  The same applies to people from Strabane, which was in the same parish up until recently.  The people of Strabane can travel the length and breadth of Europe, the length and breadth of Great Britain and indeed the <Col N="914" /> length and breadth of Ireland, but they cannot travel across to Lifford because of the decision taken by some faceless person in Whitehall, probably in a carpeted, centrally heated room, who plays ducks and drakes with markers and who has never been to Ireland except perhaps on a flying visit when he went back with preconceived ideas on what was happening and convinced he has the solution to it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make representations to the British authorities and to point out to them that we have the will to co-operate fully with the British Government in keeping the peace in both parts of Ireland but we will not tolerate Irish people on both sides of the Border being inconvenienced.  I question whether this is within the terms of the Anglo-lrish Treaty of 1922 or the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It is certainly not in keeping with the spirit of either those agreements that the British Army authorities should unilaterally take a decision to close the Border at the drop of a hat.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago on my way home I arrived at the checkpoint at Strabane at 10.10 p.m. to take my place in the queue of cars.  I was in no rush to be checked.  I will tolerate that in the interests of security but I discovered after about ten minutes that there was something more serious involved than just a short delay. The driver of one of the cars in front of me came to the same conclusion.  He then found out that the first car contained no driver and was just sitting there with sidelights on.  I went to the checkpoint to inquire what was happening at 10.20 p.m., only to be told that the Border had been closed for the night and I would have to go via Clady.  That is an inconvenient way to travel across the Border.  There is a very narrow street in the village of Clady and one has to drive through a very narrow checkpoint and over a very dangerous bridge which is not capable of taking heavy tonnage.  It took me an hour and three quarters to cross the Border, a journey which should have taken me two or three minutes.</P>
    <P>On that occasion I discovered elderly people who had long distances to travel <Col N="915" /> after they had crossed the Border, cars containing young children who were crying and becoming uneasy and whose parents were being subjected to this inconvenience.  The British Army in trying to beat the IRA are abusing the ordinary people who cross at the checkpoint on the Lifford and Strabane Road. I want to put on the record that all they have achieved is that they have created a target for the IRA to destroy.  Knowing the people involved on the fringes of violence and the way they think, the minute that checkpoint was constructed they were thinking of how to destroy it. If it was not there that challenge would not be there.</P>

In the interests of the safety of the people, good public relations and all that is good in people, I ask the Minister to make a special case to the British authorities to stop this awful infringement of the rights of people to cross the Border between Lifford and Strabane, which I have been able to do right through my lifetime.  That was the first time I was stopped going across the Border.  I have been delayed but never stopped.</P>

      <P>I am grateful and thankful to Deputy Harte for raising this very serious problem.  I have noted carefully the details of the situation as described by him.  I fully sympathise with the points he has raised concerning the disruption and the inconvenience caused to people and to himself in the Strabane-Lifford area by the unannounced closure of the British Army permanent vehicle checkpoint in Strabane on a number of occasions <Col N="916" /> during the past few months.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who have to go through this checkpoint on their way to and from work on either side of the Border.  As Deputy Harte said, while we all appreciate the need for appropriate security measures to counter the threat of proxy bomb attacks, I am also concerned that people going about their lawful business and travelling to and from work should not be subjected to unreasonable disruption and inconvenience as a result of these measures.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that my Department have recently received a number of complaints about the unannounced closure of the British Army checkpoint in Strabane at various times over the past few weeks. These complaints, which are similar in many respects to those raised by Deputy Harte, have already been raised with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast.  I can assure Deputy Harte that the concerns which he has expressed here tonight will be conveyed immediately to the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat with a view to ensuring that the checkpoint is operated in a sensible and flexible manner so as to keep the inconvenience to the local community to the absolute minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harte pointed out that there were problems with this checkpoint last winter when it was frequently closed at night as a precautionary measure against the danger of proxy bomb attacks.  The problems caused by this practice were discussed at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Conference in January of this year and were the subject of further discussions in the Anglo-Irish <Col N="917" /> Secretariat.  As Deputy Harte is aware, there were very few problems with the operation of this checkpoint over the summer months and it is only recently that complaints have begun to emerge again.  As I have already pointed out, these complaints have been raised with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat and appropriate representations will continue to be made with a view, as Deputy Harte suggested, towards keeping the inconvenience caused to the local community to the minimum.  I can assure Deputy Harte that the situation will be monitored and kept under review in the secretariat on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte suggested in the course of his remarks that there should be a permanent Garda-Army checkpoint at Lifford Bridge which would remove the need for a British Army checkpoint in Strabane.  The Minister for Justice set out in a detailed way the policy of the Government on this issue when replying to the Deputy's question on the Adjournment on 15 November 1990.  Unfortunately, I have nothing to add to the Minister's comments on that matter: &ldquo;... it is strictly a matter of the best police professional advice, in relation to the use of resources to their maximum effect for the protection and benefit of the community....&rdquo;. However, I can assure Deputy Harte that his personal experiences which he has related to the House this evening and are typical of many which have happened in recent times will be related to the secretariat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Deputy Byrne has given me notice of his intention to raise the situation in the Eastern Health Board area where almost 9,000 people are currently on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware &mdash;<Col N="918" /> and is indeed responsible &mdash; for the huge waiting lists in the Eastern Health Board area where thousands of patients are awaiting orthodontic care.  When one sees the frightening figures of the numbers, for example, on the priority waiting lists, the real crisis in dental care becomes startlingly visible.</P>
      <P>There are 8,951 people on the list as follows: category 1 priority, 17; category 2, 3,254, category 3, 2,545 and category 4, 1,635.  There are 1,500 people awaiting categorisation, which is equal to a massive waiting list of 8,951.  Even at the current rate of 2,250 health board patients completing their treatment each year, it still clearly statistically represents the equivalent of a four year waiting list.  It is no wonder the waiting time is four years when only one consultant orthodontist is employed on a full-time basis &mdash; and she is only a recent recruit to the Eastern Health Board &mdash; and this is for the Dublin region which has approximately 1.25 million people.  The sad state of the dental service, particularly in this city, means that it is near total collapse and affects those who cannot afford to pay the extortionate charges in the private dental sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many headlines have you seen about the strike organised by the Irish Dental Association which has been running since October 1987?  They will not agree terms with the Minister for Social Welfare to extend benefits to the dependants and spouses of insured workers.  This dispute is hurting not only the spouses and children but also insured workers paying full PRSI who are being refused treatment or charged for extractions, root treatment and even dentures. This scandal is matched by the Government's refusal to go ahead with building the long promised Dublin dental hospital.  The need to replace the existing dental hospital has been accepted by various Governments for 28 years.  The present hospital has been condemned by fire officers as a hazard and they can no longer guarantee the safety of patients <Col N="919" /> and staff using the building.  It requires £2 million to comply with fire regulations and this would be only a temporary solution. Why should this be so?  Already £1.5 million have been spent acquiring a site adjoining St. James's Hospital, including payment for detailed building plans and design fees.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Dental Hospital is unique in so far as it caters mainly for medical card holders and the socially disadvantaged in society.  It was built to cater for 2,500 people per year but caters for 1,500 people each week.  A high proportion of these people are medical card holders but the hospital also specialises in the treatment of haemophiliacs, HIV positive patients, prisoners and other medically and socially disadvantaged people, many of whom would not otherwise obtain treatment.  It also caters for the mentally and physically handicapped.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing training for about 200 graduate and post-graduate dental students, the facility proposed for Dublin could also cater for 75 dental students and the library and lecture facilities could be used by students in St. James's Hospital.  A sum of £14 million would complete this project; the people of the city need this hospital.  If £17.5 million can be found to refurbish the Taoiseach's offices, then £14 million must be found to provide a dental hospital in Dublin. Let us put an end to the pain, suffering and uncertainty of those who have to wait between one and five years for dental treatment.  I urge the Minister to look seriously at the situation and to do his best, with his ministerial colleagues, to right a wrong.  Let us provide a decent public dental service to the thousands who require it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question related to waiting lists for orthodontic treatment. I intend to confine myself essentially to the question to do it justice and I do not <Col N="920" /> intend to go over a wide range of issues which are not directly concerned.</P>
      <P>The Government continue to pay particular attention to the provision and development of orthodontic services within the overall general provision of dental services by the health board.  As part of this commitment I should like to point out that the Government made available a special allocation of £3 million in the budget for 1990 for the development of dental and orthodontic services. A further £3 million was made available as a special application in the 1991 budget and £1 million was specifically earmarked by my Department for orthodontic services. As a result of these special provisions, 2,500 children began their courses of secondary orthodontic care in 1990.  The 1991 allocation has enabled these children to continue their treatment and has also enabled a further 2,500 children to begin treatment this year.</P>
      <P>Priority in orthodontic treatment is being given to children in the most severe categories in accordance with guidelines issued to health boards by my Department. The difficulties experienced in the provision of adequate levels of orthodontic services stem to a large extent from difficulties encountered by health boards in recruiting consultant orthodontists. Recently my Department changed the conditions and salary attached to the post of consultant orthodontist which made the post more attractive. The Local Appointments Commission held a competition to fill the existing vacancies in the service with these revised conditions and salary and I am confident that a number of consultant appointments will be made to health boards as a result of this competition.</P>
      <P>This is the background to my response to the House on the specific issue of the orthodontic services provided by the Eastern Health Board.  I am confident that the House will appreciate my commitment &mdash; and the commitment of the Government &mdash; to the improvement and development of our orthodontic services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> I will now turn to the specific position in the Eastern Health Board.  A consultant orthodontist recently took up duty with the Eastern Health Board and the board are at present making arrangements with her to provide a modern orthodontic service which will include the facility to train the board's dentists in this area of dental care in addition to providing treatment for patients with the most severe orthodontic conditions.</P>
    <P>The successful recruitment of a consultant orthodontist will considerably enhance the services provided by the board.  In addition to the services of the newly appointed consultant, the board also provide 20 additional consultant specialist treatment sessions per week in various clinics throughout the Eastern Health Board area.  These treatment centres are in Old County Road, Crumlin, North Strand, Greystones, Leixlip and Kildare.  The board completed 2,250 orthodontic treatments in 1990 and a total of 3,660 children are currently undergoing orthodontic treatment.  I should like to point out that in category 1 &mdash; the category of greatest severity &mdash; the waiting list is as low as 17.</P>
    <P>Under the tuition of consultant staff from the Dublin Dental Hospital, seven of the board's dental surgeons have been trained in the provision of secondary care orthodontics.  It is proposed that, as soon as possible, the newly appointed consultant will commence orthodontic training of dental surgeons from the health board staff.  A further development of this training programme will enable the less severe orthodontic cases to be treated by a specially trained dentist.  The board will, therefore, be able to deal more expeditiously with cases requiring treatment and to make further considerable reductions in waiting lists.</P>
    <P>These developments indicate that considerable progress has been made recently by the Eastern Health Board in the provision of orthodontic services. The recent appointment of a consultant <Col N="922" /> orthodontist to the board marks a significant development in these services. The services will continue to develop and expand now that we are beginning to get the structure in place for their provision.  I do not accept Deputy Byrne's suggestion that the service referred to tonight is near total collapse.  The reverse is the case. We will see as the years go by that cases will be dealt with more expeditiously because the consultant orthodontist is in place and we are beginning to train our own personnel from the health board to deal with cases requiring less severe treatment, leaving the specialists free to deal more expeditiously with the more outstanding and more difficult cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this matter I am hoping the Minister will intervene in this dispute in view of the failure of all efforts to date to have it resolved.  The dispute has the potential to create chaos in the postal service and to do irreparable damage to An Post through loss of business which, I believe, has been quite substantial already.</P>
      <P>The origins of this dispute date back to 1987.  The relevant scheme was processed under clause 3 of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> of that year.  The case against payment of this award was put forward by the company and the Department of Finance to the arbitration board and resulted in an award that was less favourable than any other provided for in strict accordance with clause 3 of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It is worth noting that the award of 6 per cent was one of the lowest ever in the entire public sector.  Failure to pay this award in full is likely to affect industrial relations throughout the entire public service.  The refusal by the company to honour the arbitrator's award is without precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position is that the company lack credibility in their insistence that An Post are prepared to pay on condition that the unions accept certain <Col N="923" /> measures contained in the viability plan. Bearing in mind that the decision of the arbitration board predates publication of that infamous document, it is even more difficult to understand the company's reluctance to pay in view of the Minister's statement that the plan no longer exists. If further proof is needed it can be got from examination of the Minister's speech yesterday on the ongoing confidence motion.  The Minister said he has now got rid of the viability plan.  Any reference to this should be removed from the negotiating table and the award paid in full.</P>
    <P>This dispute is about the unconditional and full implementation of terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme which is the cornerstone of public service and labour relations.  If this is not honoured on this occasion we will for many years be picking up the pieces of the irresponsible actions of the company. Considering that the award is so small the ramifications are quite serious.  If there is lack of faith on the part of the workers in the public sector, if they feel that the only mechanism they have to resolve problems within the public service is abolished, it will lead to a spate of industrial disputes which will be of no good to the country.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to do everything within his power to have this matter resolved.</P>

      <P>An Post's cumulative losses to the end of 1993 will come to about £45 million while the company's borrowings now stand at about £16 million.  Projected losses are as follows: in 1991, £4 million; in 1992, £10 million and in 1993, £21 million.  It would not be reasonable to expect customers to bear increases in postal charges in addition to those which have already been put in place in 1990 and earlier this year.  I have already said, and I repeat, that the provision of a State subsidy is not possible.  Therefore the net effect must be <Col N="924" /> the end to An Post's loss making; that is the real solution.</P>
      <P>I have devoted considerable time and effort to preparing the ground for the necessary management union negotiations. Last spring following a meeting with the unions and protracted discussions involving the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, a formula for management union negotiations was agreed. Following that and at my request An Post decided to rescind their decision to withdraw from the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  After the summer I asked An Post to withdraw their viability plan, which they did, and to replace it with a set of proposals, which they did, designed to achieve a break even position in 1992. I insisted at that time that these proposals specifically exclude the question of the closure of sub-post offices and the provision of roadside letter boxes.  Despite these initiatives, unfortunately, the negotiations between management and unions did not make much progress.  I should point out that the Minister for Labour has been active with me in helping to make progress in this entire area. In September and in accordance with the formula worked out with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions I requested the company and the unions to participate in talks under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.  These talks covered the company's proposals for cost reductions and the question of the payment of the award.</P>
      <P>As the House probably knows, the latest talks were adjourned in the early hours of Wednesday morning last after nine hours of negotiations.  I understand that new proposals put forward by An Post with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission are being considered by the executive committee of the unions.  They have been asked to convey their views to the commission which is expected to meet tomorrow, Friday, to consider their response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very fundamental issues to be resolved in this dispute, as I am sure <Col N="925" /> the Deputy is aware.  I know that everybody wants to avoid a repetition, as the Deputy has mentioned, of the unfortunate and protracted industrial dispute that occurred 12 years ago in the Post Office.  That dispute caused untold hardship to the staff as well as to customers, industry and so on, but particularly to those dependent on social welfare.  At this time the Post Office needs a fresh start.  An enormous amount of effort has been expended over the past year to secure this.  I regard the new proposals put forward by An Post last Tuesday, with the assistance of the commission, as the basis for an early resolution of the dispute.  I would therefore call this evening on both sides to address these new proposals urgently with a view to securing early settlement.</P>
    <P>The postal service plays a major part in the economic and social life of the community and in addition provides very important agency services particularly in the disbursement of social welfare payments and in attracting funds for the national savings services.  I hope those words of mine this evening will be listened to by both sides.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is aware, the social employment scheme has turned out to be very successful.  It is availed of in many communities.  An issue which concerns the people involved in these schemes each year around Christmas time is the payment of an annual bonus, in other words an extra week's pay.  The reason I am alerting the Minister at this early stage is that I know <Col N="926" /> it is a matter that many people will be confronted with in the near future.  Many of those on social employment schemes suffer a certain degree of financial hardship around Christmas.  A certain degree of injustice would be removed by paying the bonus to those people.  I do not think the cost to the Exchequer would be very substantial.  The move would generate a lot of goodwill and extra enthusiasm on the part of the workers who participate in these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, announced that the social welfare Christmas bonus will be paid again this year.  The bonus is payable to persons in receipt of long term social welfare payments, including persons who are long term unemployed and in receipt of unemployment compensation payments, and also to persons who are in receipt of payments which are directly linked to the rates of unemployment payments. Participants on the social employment scheme are in receipt of payments which are not directly linked to the unemployment payments they were receiving while they were on the live register.</P>
      <P>The level of payment to participants on the scheme is pitched above that which such persons would be entitled to had they remained on social welfare.  Accordingly, participants on the scheme are compensated for the loss of extra benefits such as the Christmas bonus which they might be entitled to had they remained on the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, I announced increases in the rates payable to participants under the scheme.  The rate payable to participants without dependants increased from £69 per week to £72 per week, the rate for an adult dependant increased from £29.50 per week to £31.50 per week and the full rate for a child dependant increased from £11 per week per child to £12 per week per child.  These increases were secured in order to maintain the attractiveness of the scheme for <Col N="927" /> the long term unemployed.  I wish to acknowledge the remarks of the Deputy about the success and value of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I introduced the child dependant allowance at the beginning of last year to encourage greater numbers of long term unemployed people with child dependants to participate in the scheme.  At the end of 1989 only 30 per cent of participants had dependants.  However, at the end of September this year the percentage of participants with adult and child dependants had increased to 54 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have said in the past that I would like to be in a position to increase the payments to persons depending on social welfare or manpower programme payments for a living.  At the same time I must also act in a responsible way by having regard to the capacity of the Exchequer to make such payments.  As such, I am using the funds made available to me for the social employment scheme to provide opportunities for the long term unemployed on the basis of normal weekly payments.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government announced on 5 June last that the intake into the social employment scheme would be increased by 2,500 over and above the original 1991 target.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> This means that 12,500 people will be on the scheme at the end of the year.  Further Exchequer funds to meet this increased level of activity are being made available to FAS by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am on record as saying that the social employment scheme provides the opportunity for persons who had been long term unemployed to become involved in a work related situation, albeit on a part time basis, for one year.  The projects undertaken are of significant benefit to local communities and it is generally accepted that participation on the scheme is worth while and helps the long term unemployed to improve their prospects of obtaining employment when opportunities become available.</P>
    <P>While I understand the points being made by Deputy Finucane, I made certain commitments this year to improve the scheme as outlined in relation to increases for both child dependants and the allowances.  To use any of the allocation for 1991 would decrease the number of people on the scheme for the last quarter of the year.  The points made can be looked at in the overall budgetary position for 1992 and I will certainly bear the Deputy's remarks in mind during those discussions.  I am afraid the allocation for 1991 is fixed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 18 October 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the Government are committed to a programme of reform of the social welfare system broadly within the framework outlined by the Commission on Social Welfare.  There is a specific undertaking in the programme to move by 1993 to the priority level or rates recommended by the Commission.</P>
      <P>Thereafter, social welfare rates will be further and progressively increased, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission, as the resources of the economy permit.</P>
      <P>The priority rate recommended by the Commission was £45 in 1985 terms.  The 1991 equivalent of this is £54.00 and the 1993 rate, assuming annual inflation at 3 per cent per annum, would be around £58.  The Government are committed to achieving the 1993 equivalent of the £45 priority rate by 1993.</P>
      <P>The basic rate of long-term unemployment assistance is £55 at present, an increase of 46 per cent on the level which applied in 1987.  Therefore, the priority rate has been achieved for the long-term unemployed this year.  The basic rate of short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance was increased by 11.1 per cent from £45 to £50 in July as a step towards reaching the priority rate by 1993.  The adult dependant allowance rates for unemployment payments were also increased to maintain the relationship recommended by the Commission and to give significant increases to families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> This year's budget increases led to additional expenditure of some £150 million in a full year.  The additional special increases for those on the lowest payments and the increase in and streamlining of the child dependant payments led to substantial increases as follows: a couple with four children on short-term unemployment assistance received an increase of £11 (9.2 per cent) per week; a similar couple on long-term unemployment assistance received an increase of £9 &mdash; 7.1 per cent; a couple with two children on unemployment or disability benefit received an additional £5.20 &mdash; 5.1 per cent &mdash; and the payment to a widow on a contributory pension with three children was increased by £4 &mdash; 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above increases the rate of child benefit payable in respect of the fourth child was increased by £7.10 per month in October equivalent to £85.20 on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> also contains a commitment to devote resources to child income support on a scale which will implement the child support measures recommended by the Commission.  The initiatives taken in the budget represent the first step in implementing that commitment. The programme also recognises the importance of the family income supplement in targeting resources towards families in low-paid employment. An additional £1 million this year and £2.5 million in a full year is being spent on this scheme to increase the income thresholds and the level of payments. A family on £140 per week with two children gained an extra £12 per week.</P>
    <P>The general increases together with the specific improvements outlined above indicate that those on lower incomes, and particularly families, will benefit in a major way under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The improvements which have been made over the last three years under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> demonstrate the benefit to social welfare recipients of the consensus approach to <Col N="773" /> social and economic development on which the programme was based.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> contains a commitment to make substantial improvements in the structure of the family income supplement scheme.  The Government have already acted on this commitment this year, by making the following improvements to the scheme; the weekly income limits were raised to £140 for a one child family and £276 for a family with eight children; the maximum payment limits were abolished, thereby increasing payments to families on very low incomes; from the end of October, children aged between 18 and 21 who are attending full-time education will be regarded as qualifying children.</P>
      <P>As a result of these and earlier improvements to FIS, the number of recipients of the family income supplement scheme has risen to 6,637.  This is 29 per cent above the corresponding figure for September 1989.  The scheme provides for 26,460 children which is 40 per cent above the corresponding figure for September 1989.</P>
      <P>The increased level of take-up reflects the major improvements I have made to the scheme in recent years.  These include: a substantial increase in the income limits for eligibility; an increase in the number of qualifying children in a family from five to eight; the introduction of a minimum payment of £5 for all recipients and a reduction of the hours-of-work qualification from 24 to 20 hours.</P>
      <P>Further improvements to the family income supplement will be considered in the light of the general development of child income support provision.</P>

      <P>At present a person applying for an old age non-contributory pension or a widow's non-contributory pension can have weekly means of up to £6 per week and qualify for the maximum pension. As far as capital is concerned, this means that a person can have up to £5,400 if a widow, £2,987.50 if a single old age pensioner or £5,975 if a married old age pensioner and still receive the full rate pension.</P>
      <P>Only a minority of recipients have means in excess of £6.  For example, in September 1991 over 68 per cent of old age pensioners, 65 per cent of widows and 90 per cent of those on the lone parent's allowance were in receipt of maximum payments.</P>
      <P>The question of a change in the level of the £6 disregard would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.  My policy in recent years has been to use the available resources to provide increases in the basic rates of pension payment rather than increases in the levels of disregards. In this way the limited resources available are channelled to those most in need.</P>

    <P>It is very difficult to determine with any degree of accuracy the numbers of persons likely to be affected and the consequential financial impact, of bilateral agreements on social security.  However, <Col N="778" /> it is estimated that approximately 600 people will qualify for Irish <i>pro-rata</i> pensions under the provisions of the agreement in the first year of operation at an estimated cost of £700,000.</P>

      <P>A review of all aspects of the ban on bituminous coal in the Dublin area was undertaken in July last by the Department of the Environment in consultation with my Department.  It concluded that an increase in the rate of the weekly fuel allowance was not warranted for the 1991-92 heating season.</P>
      <P>The new heating season commenced on Monday 14 October last.  The amount of the smokeless fuel allowance remains at £3 per week and the conditions for receiving the allowance are the same as last season.  The rate of allowance was set having regard to the increased costs to households arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in the greater Dublin area in 1990.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the measures introduced for the new heating season will assist the households concerned in meeting the additional costs involved during the new season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to ensure that entitlement to the pension is limited to those who have made a reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund during the course <Col N="780" /> of their careers.  This condition applies to self-employed persons, including farmers, in the same way as it applies to all insured people.  Accordingly, self employed persons who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over will not qualify for the old age contributory pension.  However, self-employed persons in that age group who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for the old age contributory pension.  Such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that these social insurance contributions payable by the self-employed also give cover for widows contributory pensions to which entitlement can arise after three years insurance.  The self-employed have been paying contributions for three years since the end of March this year.</P>
    <P>Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  A number of possible options were considered including that of giving those affected the option of purchasing the extra number of years required.  However, it was found that the net cost would be prohibitive and financing it would be a major burden on those contributing.  In this regard, costings made in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self employed contributors who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned. The extra rate of contribution which would have to be paid by self employed contributors to finance such extension would be 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.</P>
    <P>Refunds of the old age pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance less than ten years before pension age and who fail <Col N="781" /> to qualify for either old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  This includes provision for the payment of interest on such refunds due after 1 November 1990.  The rate of interest is equal to the increase in the consumer price index for each full calendar year after the date the contributions have been made.</P>
    <P>The Government have also given a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to examine the possibility, in the context of structural reform in agriculture, of an arrangement whereby farmers in the older age groups selling, leasing or transferring their farms will be provided with a retirement incentive related to means.  In this same context of structural reform, the interaction with the position of farmers aged 56 and over who pay PRSI contributions but who will not qualify for a contributory pension will be considered.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, one of the conditions for entitlement to old age contributory pension is that a person must have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions since 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect or since the date he/she entered into insurance, if later.  It is relevant to point out that prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable. These were &mdash; national health insurance, widows and orphans pensions and unemployment insurance contributions.  Such contributions did not include an element in respect of old age (contributory) pension. The present contribution conditions for entitlement to pensions are being examined by the National Pensions Board.  They will be reporting on this and other issues in their final report which is expected before the end of the year. The matter will then be considered further in this context.</P>

      <Quest>when was the last time income limits were reviewed regarding the payment of maternity benefit; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that women earning in excess of £11,000 per annum cannot claim the maternity benefit equivalent to their salary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment the rate of payment is 70 per cent of a woman's reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year, subject to a minimum payment of £76 and a maximum payment of £154 per week. The maximum payment is paid when the woman's earnings are £11,000 or more. Since the introduction of the scheme, the upper earnings limit has been the same as that applying to pay-related benefits generally.  The income ceiling for all pay-related benefits, including maternity allowance, has remained at £11,000 since April 1983.  Given the financial constraints in recent years the general policy has been to target increases towards those on lowest payments, rather than increase pay-related benefits.  I will continue to keep the situation under review and will consider any possible increase in the ceiling in the context of the budget, and in the light of possible developments at EC level.</P>

      <P>Part VII of the Pensions Act 1990 which I introduced last year requires occupational pension schemes to apply the principle of equal treatment to men and women.  The Act requires an end to discrimination, both direct and indirect, in the scope of conditions of access to schemes, benefit rights and contribution levels.  This part of the Act will come into operation on a date to be prescribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before bringing this Part of the Act into operation I am considering the implications of certain relevant developments at EC level, in particular the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the <Col N="783" /> case of Barber -<i>v</i>- Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance Group.</P>
    <P>In January last I sought the advice of the new pensions board on the implications of this judgment for the implementation of Part VII of the Pensions Act.  I have recently received the board's report on this matter.  It is my intention to bring forward regulations shortly to implement the equal treatment requirements of the Pensions Act.</P>

      <P>The value to a claimant of free board and lodgings occurs, in the main, in the assessment of the benefit accruing to a young person living at home and claiming unemployment assistance.  It covers the value of accommodation, meals, support and maintenance as well as generally sharing in the standard of living of the household and the facilities which the household enjoys.  Because the value of free board and lodgings depends on the household circumstances the amount of the assessment varies.  The assessment achieves a degree of equity as between applicants in different household circumstances.  Standardising the value of board and lodgings in the assessment would be contrary to this.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget I introduced a minimum weekly payment of £5 for unemployment assistance claimants whose current entitlement is less than £5 and whose only means is the yearly value of free board and lodgings at home.</P>
      <P>The operation of the means test ensures that assistance is targeted at those who are most in need and is an equitable way of directing limited resources.  To standardise the value of free board and lodgings in the assessment of means would have major financial implications.</P>

      <P>The conditions governing the career break and job sharing schemes in the Civil Service are laid down by the Department of Finance.  Any alterations to those conditions would be a matter for that Department.  It is understood, however, that there are no plans for any such changes at present.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of these schemes in 1984 a total of 612 career breaks and 285 job-sharing applications have been granted.  There are 291 staff on career breaks and 262 staff job-sharing at present.  Details of the applications granted and of the grades involved are set out in a tabular statement which will be made available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Records in my Department are not maintained in such a manner as would enable precise information on the total number of applications or the exact numbers refused to be extracted without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of time and effort.  However, I can say that refusals were almost exclusively confined to those applications that did not come within the scope of the schemes as laid down by the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the parameters of the schemes were well known to the staff, the vast majority of applications were received only from those who knew they were eligible.  Accordingly, there were very few refusals.  In the case of the career <Col N="785" /> break scheme, the need to retain specialist expertise in key areas of Departments was the main reason for refusing applications.</P>
    <P>Job-sharing applications which come <Col N="786" /> within the scope of the scheme are generally approved but delays can occasionally occur in finding a job-sharing partner in the required location.</P>

      <P>Membership of a reorganised accountancy body is the most usual manner in which a person attains qualification to practise as an auditor. Such accountancy bodies require that their members act in a professional manner through compliance with bylaws, codes of conduct, auditing guidelines and such like.  These offer guidance to members on appropriate modes of conduct, including the auditor's responsibility in relation to fraud, other irregularities and errors.  There is no provision in company law which would preclude the reporting by auditors of fraud or suspected fraud to the appropriate authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 191 of the Companies Act, 1990 it will be necessary for each accountancy body seeking recognition thereunder to satisfy me as Minister that the standards they apply to their members in such matters as ethics, professional integrity and technical standards are satisfactory.  Moreover, section 192 of the same Act provides that I, as Minister, may require a, recognised body of accountants to submit <Col N="789" /> for approval a code prescribing standards of professional conduct for their members.  In this way, the guidance given to members of recognised accountancy bodies, if necessary can be tailored to meet practical situations which arise in relation to auditing.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in that reply, a sum of £45,000 was made available in 1989 for the Donegal pilot flax growing project out of the science and technology sub-programme of the operational programme for industry.  The up-to-date position is that, following a review of the pilot project in 1990, it was decided that further funding could not be justified under the terms of the science and technology sub-programme.</P>
      <P>A meeting of the representatives of all the agencies having an involvement with the pilot project was held at which it was agreed that the future of the flax project could best be progressed within an overall co-ordinated national programme under the auspices of Teagasc.

      <P>With the exception of survivors benefits, there is no material evidence of discrimination between single and married persons under occupational pension schemes.  Generally married and single persons have similar rights in relation to eligibility for membership of schemes, members' contributions, personal benefit entitlements and retirement ages.</P>
      <P>It is a feature of many occupational schemes that a contingent survivors pension is payable to the spouse of a married person in the event of his/her death while in service or in retirement.  Such benefits are not available in the event of the death of a single person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part VII of the Pensions Act 1990 which I introduced last year requires occupational pension schemes to apply the principle of equal treatment to men <Col N="791" /> and women.  The Act implies that there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex, either direct or indirect, in particular by reference to marital and family status in the scope of and conditions of access to schemes, benefit rights and contribution levels.  It is my intention to bring forward regulations shortly to implement the equal treatment requirements of the Pensions Act.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Act aims to regulate occupational pension schemes and to protect the interest of scheme members by setting standards which schemes will have to meet.  The Act lays down minimum standards in relation to such matters as preservation of benefits, solvency levels, disclosure of information to scheme members and trustee responibilities.</P>
    <P>A new regulatory body &mdash; the pensions board &mdash; has been established to monitor the development of occupational pension schemes and their compliance with the new legislation.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I answered another question by the Deputy relating to what are known as &ldquo;yellow slips&rdquo; which are supplied by the gardaí when urine samples are taken in drunk driving cases.  I explained to him that it would not be possible to supply a range of detailed information sought by him in relation to the availability of those slips without a disproportionate investment of Garda time and resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today the Deputy is looking for further detailed information &mdash; this time about Garda movements, deployments etc., in the Louth/Meath Division during a particular 24 hour period on 30 April and 1 May last.  Although I have no idea whether these questions are related, I can say that they have one thing in common and that is that there is no way of dealing with them without wasting Garda resources.  If the Deputy is interested in a particular incident, of course, or has information concerning any incident that may have occurred in the Louth/Meath <Col N="794" /> Division on the night in the question &mdash; and that is an inference that might be drawn by anybody reading the question &mdash; I shall be glad to have the matter examined.</P>
    <P>I should, incidentally, make it clear that it is not and never has been the practice to supply the kind of details sought by the Deputy in relation to Garda personnel, car registrations and so on. The reason for exercising discretion in matters of this kind are widely understood. I would advise the Deputy that I have no intention of departing from long established practice in this regard.</P>

      <P>As Bond Bridge is located on a regional road, primary responsibility for this project rests with the local authority, Kildare County Council, and the cost falls to be financed from local resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my Department for such roads.  In the case of Kildare County Council, these grants total £1,868,000 in 1991, including a supplementary grant of £500,000, for improvement works, because of the special needs of the county.  The determination of priorities in the expenditure of these grants is a matter for the local authority.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the level of funds available to me for special grants and the competing demand of other projects throughout the country, I am not in a position to provide such a grant in this case.  The local authority have been so informed.</P>

As a result, I am glad to say that significant progress has been made in reducing the overall ENT waiting list for admission.  A total of 1,576 ENT cases were treated in 1990 compared to 1,172 treated in 1989 &mdash; an increase of 34 per cent; 1,171 cases have been treated in the first nine months of this year.

      <P>The continuing increase in the cost of drugs in the GMS which has been running at about 11 per cent in real terms, for the last four years, is a cause of serious concern.  The review group on the General Medical Services, which were representative of the Irish Medical Organisation and management, accepted that there were opportunities to reduce these costs without reducing the quality of service to patients and identified and agreed on a range of initiatives to bring this about including: the introduction of a national formulary, indicative drug targets, and the establishment of a national therapeutics advisory committee with responsibility for the determination and co-ordination of appropriate prescribing levels.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the review group in relation to drugs are being phased in on an ongoing basis as part of a co-ordinated strategy and are expected to bring about a stabilisation of costs in this area.  The success of the strategy will be reviewed at the end of the year to ascertain if further measures to control costs are warranted.</P>

      <P>Traditional services for south and mid-Kildare have been provided from St. Dympna's Hospital, Carlow, by the South-Eastern Health Board.  With the transfer of services to the Eastern Health Board it is envisaged that mental health centres will be established at Castledermot and Kildare town and hostels <Col N="812" /> will be provided at Naas, Athy and Maynooth. In-patient treatment will be provided at a new acute 30 bed psychiatric unit at Naas General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board received as part of their allocation for 1991 an amount of £750,000 to enable both community and acute in-patient services in south and mid-County Kildare to commence this year.  Discussions are continuing between officials of my Department and the Eastern Health Board in relation to 1992 funding requirements for this service as part of the overall Estimates cycle.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>Two requests were received by my Department in the last year from County Kildare Vocational Education Committee for the appointment of secretaries for their schools.</P>
      <P>Clerical and maintenance staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme basis and it is a matter for the VEC to deploy such staff as they deem appropriate to the scheme's requirements.  In November 1990, my Department sanctioned two maintenance posts for the scheme and two additional clerical posts were sanctioned in March 1991.  As a result, it is understood that County Kildare VEC have clerical and caretaking services at all the schools in its scheme, including Confey College, Leixlip.</P>

      <P>However, an application submitted by Maynooth Community Council for the provision of a sports complex including a swimming pool was forwarded to Kildare County Council in January 1990 for their consideration under these new arrangements.</P>
