      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider his withdrawal of an offer yesterday to have a debate on the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conferences in the House in view of the fact that, even though the defence issue may not be as imminent as it appeared to be before, there are other vital issues for Ireland, including the financing of the <Col N="258" /> Community and the competence of the Community, on which Members would have something constructive to say which they cannot say in the absence of a foreign affairs committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual with Deputy Bruton it is a borderline case, but you and I are so courteous that we will not indulge him in this matter.  I did not withdraw the offer of a debate.  I just suggested that, because of the way things are developing in the two IGCs, it might be more fruitful if we had it later.  I also suggested to the Deputy that I would be in a much better position to let the Deputies know the position after I have met the President of the Council which I will do very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to take up too much time on this issue but Members might wish to express their views on the matter to the Government before the Government go to the summit so that the members' views may be reflected in the position taken by the Government to the extent possible.  For that reason I would hope the Taoiseach might agree.  I will pursue the matter through the Whips rather than questioning the Taoiseach further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the impending disaster in the African continent, in Ethiopia and many other countries, and the inevitable loss of life, would the Taoiseach consider the Government taking a special initiative in view of the fact that a meeting of the Council of Ministers is due to take place in June?  Does the Taoiseach not feel that the Government should take the lead in relation to this <Col N="259" /> disaster and try to get the European Community to respond to the serious difficulties and problems facing the African continent?</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the question of the foreign affairs committee which the Taoiseach has on a number of occasions indicated he is interested in establishing.  With other party leaders I met the Taoiseach some months ago to discuss the matter.  In the light of the important issues which this House should be addressing with regard to foreign affairs, when it is proposed to establish the committee?  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House what precisely is holding up the establishment of this committee in view of the fact that at this point all parties in the House feel there should be one?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate what precisely is holding up the establishment of the committee?  My understanding is that the Government Whip indicated it was not a matter for him but for the Taoiseach.  May I have clarification now on what is holding this up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same subject, and so the Taoiseach can respond comprehensively, it is the case that before this proposal was firmed up the Taoiseach met the deputy leader of my party but, subsequent to that, I wrote to the Taoiseach setting out Fine Gael's views on the matter and the Taoiseach to date has not replied to that letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that an attempt has been made by the Whip of my party to discuss this matter through the Whips, and the Government Whip indicated that he has no basis on which he could discuss the matter as he had no instructions from the Taoiseach.  The problem is that the Taoiseach has not given an indication as to his views on the establishment of a foreign affairs committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week on the Order of Business I requested, in relation to the legislative programme, that the Taoiseach arrange with his Whip to brief the Opposition party Whips about the legislative programme we will be facing in view of the need for Opposition parties <Col N="261" /> to prepare for legislation.  I would draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that between now and the week of the local elections we have nine sitting days, if we do not sit on Fridays, and if we come back for two weeks after that, which is the understanding, we have only an additional six days.  In total we are looking at a maximum of 18 working days to implement the legislative programme. Would it not be reasonable for the Taoiseach to instruct his Whip to indicate what legislation it is intended to take within that timetable?  Otherwise we will have the unsatisfactory guillotine process continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whip intends to keep in touch with the other Whips about the other business we hope to hear transacted before the summer recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to a foreign affairs committee, in view of the fact that we now have further information from Fine Gael in regard to an apparent obstacle at that level, and as the Government Whip has indicated he has no function in the matter, will the Taoiseach consider initiating a further round of talks with the parties in Opposition to try to finally resolve whatever difficulties are there so this important committee can be established?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, let me ask the Minister for the Environment when it is proposed to introduce legislation to allow the promised shared ownership loans to be processed by the local authorities and thereby eliminate the anxiety that exists at present among people who are prospective applicants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

The purpose of my amendment which you feel is not within the remit of this Bill is to develop the idea of a patients' <Col N="266" /> charter which was integral to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, and the Government under this legislation are implementing the main eligibility changes.  It is very important that such a charter would have a legal underpinning, and I think this is the opportunity, when the Health Act, 1970 is being amended, for the Minister to develop such a charter.  It is important that a charter have legal underpinning because without such underpinning you cannot impose an obligation on the health boards and the different health agencies to make every reasonable effort to fulfil that charter.  Equally it is important that a patients' charter have provision for review of the progress on the charter and statutory provision for action to be taken where shortcomings are found in the execution of that charter.  In Ireland we have a system of health services which have no quality guarantees, and we need to enshrine such guarantees in law.  This is an opportunity we will not get again, I fear, for several years to put in some clear, defined health targets and guarantees to patients.  The present situation is that patients do not even have open access to their own medical records which I think is a fundamental right that should be on any patients' charter.  My experience, and I am sure the Minister will confirm this, is that patients' complaints are typically being left unanswered by hospital authorities and even by his own Department.  Recently I tabled questions to the Minister seeking to know the number of complaints and whether they had been dealt with.  While the Minister furnished me figures on some odd thousands of complaints that had been furnished to his Department, he did not reply on the issue of how those complaints had been resolved or whether they have been resolved.  I think that is a fundamental problem.  There should be the right for patients, without having to go into the courts, that hospital authorities and the Minister account for all that has happened.  That is why it is so important that we have a charter in respect of patients' rights.</P>

      <P>I indicated to Deputy Bruton that he could comment briefly as to why his amendment was ruled out of order.  I am not obliged to give reasons but I will give a reason for this.  It is clear to me that amendments Nos. 1, 8 and 9 must be adjudged out of order as they are not relevant to the provisions of the Bill as read a Second Time.  Deputy Richard Bruton's amendment seeks to provide for a charter of patients' rights.  That is outside the scope of the Bill.  Amendment No. 8 seeks to make health contributions tax deductible, and amendment No. 9 deals with <Col N="268" /> the issue of reception of patients into psychiatric centres.  The Bill deals only with two issues, eligibility for hospital services and the abolition of the income limit for health contributions.  Therefore, all three amendments are not relevant to the provisions of the Bill and are more appropriate to other legislation.  That is the position.  The Deputy may comment on my ruling but let us not waste unnecessary time on these matters.</P>

      <P>Having read the amendments, I totally accept your ruling, a Cheann Comhairle.  The reason we put down these amendments is that we referred to these matters on Second Stage and hoped that the Minister would have agreed with the arguments for a patients charter which was recommended by one of the expert committees set up by the Minister.  The point has been well made by Deputy Bruton and I repeat that the Minister has lost the opportunity to include such a provision in this legislation. Admittedly, there is no reference to a charter of patients' rights in the Bill as passed on Second Stage, which has led to the Ceann Comhairle's ruling, which is correct, but the Minister has the opportunity to put down an amendment on Report Stage to include such a provision in the legislation.  I ask the Minister between now and Report Stage &mdash; which may be difficult because of the guillotine motion &mdash; to avail of the facilities at his disposal to introduce an amendment along these lines which would take into account the concerns expressed by us on Committee Stage and by those people <Col N="269" /> who have made various recommendations to him, some of which he has included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I too regret very much that this amendment has been ruled out of order.  I am not questioning your ruling, a Cheann Comhairle, but I had hoped that at some stage the Minister would have considered the rights of patients.  At times the Minister can sound like Ben Dunne with his value for money principle. However, it is more important to ensure that patients are getting the service they deserve.  Many patients who are paying their health contributions and those who have medical cards are being refused the health services to which they are legally entitled.  Surely any good Minister would introduce a provision which would ensure that patients, the most important element of our health services, are protected.</P>
      <P>At present patients who need surgery are being told &mdash; I am not going to labour this point &mdash; they may have to wait for up to three years for surgery but that if they have the money they can get the surgery done privately.  The Minister, if he has any sense of responsibility, should protect the public from that type of touting for business which is going on at present in our health services.  It is in the interests of some consultants to ensure that the long waiting lists are maintained because they gain from them.  Surely the first priority of any good Minister would be to protect the rights of patients. People who need urgent surgery are being told in a subtle and polished way that if they can pay the money they will get the surgery.  I have raised this issue in the House before but the Minister has taken no action on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

People in the social welfare area who require medical certification of their condition are being refused certification by some consultants who think it is above them to write such letters for their patients.  Surely a patient has rights when he is dealing with a Government agency who can affect his income and his family life.  As I have said, I regret that there is no reference to patients' rights in this legislation.  The Bill is merely a value for money exercise.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the table in section 2 which provides that adult persons unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants shall have full eligibility for the services under Part IV of the 1970 Act.  On Second Stage the Minister introduced the concept of equalising the determining factor for eligibility for medical cards.  The frontline of our medical services should be the ability of someone to be able to contact their GP without undue financial hardship.  If this service was liberalised &mdash; I am not sure whether the Minister's equalisation is liberalisation &mdash; the cost on the health services would be much less because people would be in a position to go to their doctor without undue financial hardship and be treated rather than waiting until they need hospitalisation.  I am concerned that there are cases of real hardship because of the manner this clause operates. If it is appropriate I will give one or two examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my constituents who lives in the Eastern Health Board area is deaf and dumb.  He works in sheltered employment and his income is slightly in excess of the limits as laid down by the Eastern Health Board for a medical card. Had the health board taken into account the cost of his board and lodgings he would be in receipt of less than half the eligibility limit.  That person has been refused a medical card.  I appealed that decision and produced medical evidence. Yesterday morning the health board communicated that they considered him excluded under the Act.  I am hoping the provisions of this Bill will take into account hardship cases.  This man is unable to explain his position to an investigating officer because he is deaf and dumb.  He is able to work and cook but is unable to write out his problem.  The person in question is under medication. I will give the Minister the letter from the health board and the name of the applicant whom I consider to be a genuine case.  His case was brought to the attention of other Ministers also as the <Col N="272" /> person in question is involved nationally with organisations for the deaf and dumb.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister on the subject of medical cards some time ago and it transpires that the number of medical cards is falling because of the Minister's new arrangements with the GPs which is referred to in the table. There is now a different system of payment of GPs.  In borderline cases health boards consider they should withdraw medical cards even though people are £1 or £2 over the limit.  This has led to a fall in the number of qualified people under the provisions of the section.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board region the number of medical card holders has fallen from 364,900 to 351,000; in the Midland Health Board region the number has fallen from 81,000; in the Mid-Western Health Board region it has fallen from 102,000 to 101,000; in the North Western Health Board area it has fallen from 99,000 to 98,000; in the South Eastern Health Board region it has fallen from 142,000 to 140,000; in the Southern Health Board region it has fallen from 180,000 to 173,000 and in the Western Health Board it has fallen from 163,000 to 160,000.  The Minister's explanation was that people had died and that, when the procedures were tightened up he took out the cards for persons who had died. I am talking about legitimate applications for people who need medical cards.  The number of medical cards has fallen dramatically since 1988.  The figures I quoted were given to me in reply to a parliamentary question and I will give a copy of it to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This problem should be addressed nationwide because there appears to be different interpretations &mdash; not in the guidelines&mdash; by health board officials or chief executives who have the final say in regard to cases of hardship, medical and otherwise.  I would like the guidelines included in a regulation so that we could all interpret them before making representations on behalf of these people. The bureaucracy involved in means testing for medical cards is a tremendous waste of public money and leads to friction between patients, investigating <Col N="273" /> officers and public representatives who try to reflect the views of their constituents. We have to bare the souls of our constituents before we can convince health boards they are genuine cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>I am aware that health boards have been liberal in the case of terminal illnesses and that is appropriate.  However, they are very difficult when interpreting transfer orders of property and otherwise for people who qualify for non-contributory pensions.  If there is a clause in such orders to the effect that the applicant will look after a father or mother because they have managed to maintain him and his family, it is interpreted by the health boards as being responsible for their medical condition now and in the future.  If the Minister's regulations were on the table we would see whether he intends to address this major problem.  If we could get as many people as possible to see their GP that would be the cheapest possible form of medical care.  It would cut down the cost of hospitalisation and would be a service to the community to which the Minister said he is committed.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Bruton I will quote from paragraph 55 of section IV of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which states:</P>
      <P>The Government recognise the central position of the patient in all aspects of the organisation and delivery of health care.  To this end, a &ldquo;Patients' Charter&rdquo; is being developed which will be based upon the following principles:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the right of access to services in accordance with need;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" />&mdash;the right to considerate and respectful care;</P>

    <P>&mdash;the right to respect for religious and philosophical beliefs; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the right to make a complaint.  </P>

      <P>I take a serious view if, as Deputy Allen suggests, patients are being manipulated to accept private care when public care is available to them, depending on their particular need.  It is only right to respond to the point Deputy Allen made about value for money.  In the patients' charter the prime position in the health services is for the patient.  I do not think it is wrong that there should be value for money.</P>
      <P>It appears that a fundamental difference is developing between the Government and Fine Gael in relation to the health services and the public services generally.  Yesterday I referred to the fact that the Fine Gael spokesperson in the Seanad had stated that so far as he was concerned he wanted a comprehensive education service and a comprehensive health service and did not want the books balanced at the end of the year if that impinged on an open cheque for either the health services or education.  We have to be prudent in management.  Indeed, many of our problems in the public service generally are as a result of that sort of open cheque approach which, apparently, Deputy Allen recommended here during the years 1980 to 1986.</P>
      <P>It is important that we look at opportunities to get value for money.  If we save on energy on the health service it does not inconvenience patients and the money saved can be spent in areas of greater priority.</P>
      <P>I would be pleased to raise with the health board the case mentioned by Deputy Ferris and I will contact the Deputy in relation to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the chief executive officers of health boards to draw up guidelines for medical cards.  We are putting in place a medical cards appeal system and are in the process of appointing appeals officers to each of the health boards.  There is nothing to preclude them from looking at appeals on eligibility.  It might have been implied in what Deputy Ferris said that there should be a more strict legal definition of who is <Col N="276" /> entitled to a medical card.  There was a proposal that there should be statutory guidelines but I am not in favour of that because there should be flexibility in the system to cater for people who may suffer hardship while being above the guidelines. Such people must be entitled to service on the basis of hardship.  Health boards have accepted that they will not take into account the family income supplement or income under the social employment scheme when assessing eligibility for medical cards.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the amendment of section 45 of the 1970 Health Act to specify that a person be ordinarily resident within the State to have full eligibility. Section 2 (b) amends section 45 (7) of the Act to provide that where a person is ineligible on the grounds of not being ordinarily resident in the State, the chief executive of the relevant health board may still give the person eligibility for necessary services on hardship grounds. It is standard practice in other countries to use residency as the primary criterion in determining eligibility for health services. In Ireland the chief executive officers of health boards have the authority under the 1970 Health Act to determine a person's eligibility for health services and they have evolved a similar policy.  Those deemed to be normally resident here are entitled either to full eligibility or to limited eligibility, depending on their income.  Those deemed not to be normally resident here would not, of course, be denied necessary care but they would be liable for the cost of providing it.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is no statutory basis for the operation of the residency qualification has given rise to the difficulty that there are varying interpretations between one health board and another or even from case to case as to when somebody should be regarded as resident here.  This difficulty was highlighted by the Commission on Health Funding.  It can be resolved by having uniform criteria and this is best achieved by having a statutory basis for the residency qualification.  I can then issue guidelines to ensure that uniform criteria are applied.  Deputy <Col N="277" /> Sherlock sought further clarification on this matter this morning and yesterday on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The guidelines I intend to issue will incorporate the current practice to ensure that where there is evidence that a person intends to establish a permanent residence here that person will be regarded as eligible for health services immediately. Discussions will take place between my Department and the health boards on the problem of the interpretation of residency. It is my intention that anybody with a reasonable case will be regarded as eligible for health services here.  The guidelines, which I will issue following discussions with the health boards, will be available to an appeals officer appointed by me to hear, appeals in relation to decisions on eligibility taken by a chief executive officer.  These guidelines will assist in determining whether a person is normally resident in the State for the purposes of eligibility for health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the Minister has made a commitment to a patients charter but we want that commitment underpinned by legislation.  The experience in any country which has charters for the disabled for some other category is that agencies will not act unless there is a legal obligation on them to make every reasonable effort to honour the terms of the charter.  The Minister talking about the charter and what he would like it to contain will not bring about major change in practice.  We need to see a dramatic change in the way people address their problems.  There are major gaps in what the Minister is advocating by way of a charter.  He does not include the notion that there should be a maximum waiting time and that there is a point beyond which nobody should be asked to wait for treatment, either in hospital or in the community care area. The Minister is aware that many people who are handicapped are waiting for residential care and that people are waiting for unacceptably long periods for surgery. We want a charter which will set targets that the agencies will be expected <Col N="278" /> to make reasonable efforts to achieve.  It must be legally underpinned.</P>
      <P>I now refer to the accident and emergency departments in hospitals.  A short spell of cold weather can succeed in sending these departments into a tailspin. Patients are not being treated with the care which would be expected under any charter.  This problem must be addressed and the Minister cannot deal with it by pretending it does not exist.  Consultants must give this problem the importance it deserves.  In some cases hospitals have not geared themselves to give accident and emergency departments the attention they deserve.  The only way to tackle the problem is by underpinning the position in a legal way by means of a charter. If any hospital or health board is found wanting, we must have a legal charter to which we can refer and to the terms of which they can be held accountable.</P>
      <P>It is frustrating that there are no quality guarantees and in many cases there are no targets for health agencies.  Voluntary groups to which I have spoken feel they are not acting to a plan and that there are not targets by which different health agencies will be judged.  This is an opportunity to set about bringing in these targets, particularly in the area of community care.  People should know they have a right to expect a certain level of care and that the health agencies are expected to provide it.  We know the resources will not be there for everything, but any such charter must provide that reasonable efforts be made to achieve targets.  This is the yardstick against which agencies must be judged.</P>
      <P>It is rather late for the Minister to frame an amendment to bring in regulations by way of a patients' charter but a simple enabling section would be an improvement to the Bill.  If the Minister objects to specific elements of what I have proposed, we can talk about that.  The principle must be accepted that patients are legally in the driving seat.  They are the people towards whom all our efforts are directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point I want briefly to refer to is the provision relating to people who are not ordinarily resident in this country <Col N="279" /> and are deemed ineligible for this service. I presume the Minister is trying to protect us against the position where people would come here solely for the purpose of getting medical treatment.  I take it that the provision in section 9 honours all our EC commitments to visitors and that we are not going to back out of any of those commitments.  I presume the regulations will provide that if a tourist from a non-EC country has an accident in Ireland he will not find himself in the position that prevails in other countries whereby he would have a struggle on to a plane to get back to his own country so that he would not be exposed to very high health costs.  As a country that welcomes tourists we should not enshrine in our legislation anything as draconian as that. We need an assurance from the Minister that bona fide tourists who have an accident on the roads here are not denied health care.  It is reasonable that we should afford care to these people when we make such efforts to invite them here to enjoy the benefits of our country.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement today in the House that he intends to initiate a patients' charter. Although it had been mentioned in the programme, the fact that it has been mentioned in the House will allow us to occasionally ask on the Order of Business when the Minister intends to implement it.  I would like to know &mdash; this matter has been referred to by Deputy Bruton &mdash; if this charter will have any legal basis. Will it be launched outside the House, and, if so, does the Minister think that is the correct way to approach something that is fundamental to all of us?  We should be given an opportunity to debate the contents of the charter.  By the voting strength of the Government, the Minister would be able to put through whatever charter he feels is appropriate.  A discussion would enable us to raise some of the other matters that have already been mentioned.  This Bill amends the 1970 Act.  I would like to know if a further Bill will be introduced to implement the charter or if it will be announced by way <Col N="280" /> of regulation under the 1970 Act.  Are there provisions in that Act which would allow for the setting up of a charter of patients' rights?</P>
      <P>As regards tourists and others coming here from outside the State, I am concerned that some of them, particularly from Britain, where most people are entitled to free health services, will not enjoy the same privilege when they come to Ireland.  When people move to this country on retirement, they lose their right to a medical card.  I am concerned that we are setting up a regime that will not comply with EC regulations and that will not provide the facilities that people enjoy elsewhere.  I hope that is not the case.  We, as part of the European Community, should provide health care facilities similar to those provided in other EC countries.</P>
      <P>If a tourist is considered to be not normally resident in this State, as defined in this section, and is liable for their own hospital care following an accident, by the time the matter is decided the person may have left the State and the money cannot be recouped.  If on appeal it is decided that an account is legitimately due and the person owing the money is by then outside the jurisdication, particularly the European jurisdiction, there is no way of getting that money.  This matter should be teased out.  We support the Minister in what he is doing, but we would like the matter explained further so that if and when we are queried about it we will be able to give a valid answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that he intends to introduce a patients' charter.  It is something that is long overdue.  I am glad the points raised by people on all sides about patients' rights have been accepted by the Minister.  The aspirations in the programme as agreed by the social partners are as worthless as a Fianna Fáil manifesto unless they are underpinned by decisions of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to clarify the position as regards the rights of medical card holders.  What are their liabilities on a stay in hospital of over 30 days?  Health <Col N="281" /> boards have different interpretations of that rule.  I read very clearly the statement by the Minister, Deputy Flood, in the House in February and again last week.  What he has said is at variance with what has been said on other occasions. Some medical card holders in receipt of a State pension who have to stay in hospital for more than 30 days are obliged to pay the major part of their pension to the health board.  That discriminates against medical card holders.  If a person is a category 2 patient he pays a maximum of £125 but a medical card holder who is treated in an acute hospital for more than 30 days is forced to pay indefinitely.  The vast majority of their pension, be it old age, disability or invalidity pension, has to go towards their care.</P>
    <P>The person to whom I referred in this House in February was a psychiatric patient in receipt of an old age pension and was in and out of hospital on different occasions, the overall stay being more than 30 days.  The interpretation of the rule by the Southern Health Board was that the patient had to pay for her care, which could amount to several hundreds of pounds over a number of months, out of her pension or that of her husband. That is a serious discrimination against the medical card holder <i>vis-à-vis</i> other categories.  This matter is relevant to section 2 and is related to patients' rights. Deputy Flood was reasonable in his approach but this is a matter of interpretation and should be clarified.  A directive should be sent to the health boards in this regard.  Health boards are going as far as sending debt collecting agencies to these people who are puzzled and frightened.  This is happening at a time of their lives when they are very vulnerable &mdash; as I said, one patient was a psychiatric patient.  The Minister should clarify the matter once and for all so that we can advise the people accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak about two issues.  In regard to the issue of full eligibility I note that there is evidence in each health board area, and particularly in my own health board area, of a decrease in the number of people who <Col N="282" /> have full eligibility.  It is very hard to understand how that comes about when the numbers of unemployed and long term unemployed have increased.  The Commission on Health Funding showed that about 37 per cent of the population had full eligibility in 1988-89 &mdash; it is now down to about 32 or 33 per cent of the population &mdash; but in my own health board area there is a very substantial reduction which demonstrates a very strict interpretation of the guidelines.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that some flexibility is shown in the application of the guidelines. Appeal is made to the Director of Community Care when there is medical evidence to support a case, and that system works fairly well.  The most appalling problem arises when a family may not be eligible for a medical card because tax and social welfare payments are not deductible in the assessment of eligibility for those cards.  Until the mid-1980s tax was deductible and the assessment was consequently made on take-home pay but that is not so at the moment.  I ask the Minister to consider that issue.  If people on low incomes are denied full eligibility the likelihood is that they will finish up in hospital.  When people go to the doctor they have to find £12 or £15 to meet the hospital charge and sometimes they cannot afford to purchase the drugs prescribed for them.  It is not right when that happens, especially when small children are involved.  Very often it happens that at a particular time of the week people just cannot afford to go to the doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply to my question.  I asked how long a person would have to be resident in this State to be considered an ordinary resident and to qualify for services.  I wish to pursue that matter because no such qualification is contained in the 1970 legislation.  Provision is made for an executive officer to make recommendations on a case, but the position is certainly not specified in the Bill.  Section 2 (1) of the Bill states that a person in any of the categories listed who is an ordinary resident of this State shall be included in the provision.  I should like the Minister to be more specific about <Col N="283" /> his thinking on that subject because the measure changes present legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>Every contributor to the debate welcomed the bringing forward of a patients' charter.  That measure will have a major impact in making clear to patients what their rights and entitlements are.  Such a charter has already been introduced in relation to the Revenue Commissioners.  Those of us who serve on the Committee of Public Accounts recognise that that charter has made a considerable difference to people who have occasion to do business with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The aims and ideals of the patients' charter are very laudable.  The Minister will be introducing the charter, which is a fundamental part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The charter will have a major bearing on informing patients of the kind of services and the level of services to which they are entitled.  All Members of the House would accept that it has long been the tradition of Irish hospitals to provide patients with a very high quality of service, care and attention.  The charter will simply spell that out more clearly, particularly from the patients' point of view.  The introduction of the charter is obviously the right direction to follow in the provision of health care.</P>
      <P>The Government have gone into the medical card case referred to by Deputy Allen, which he brought to my attention. About two or three weeks ago I issued the Deputy a detailed letter that referred to the various legislation under which the charges were made and I invited the Deputy to come back to me personally if he felt unhappy with the content of the letter.  I issue that invitation again today. I should be more than happy to sit down with officials and go through the contents of the letter in relation to that specific case in order to clarify that they are acting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not talking about a particular case now, I am talking about <Col N="284" /> the rights of medical card holders in general.  Let us broaden the issue now because a fundamental principle is involved.  I am sorry; I shall let the Minister of State finish.  The letter referred to one particular case, but there is a conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I just make the point because the Deputy raised the matter of an individual case.  I should not want the impression to be given in the House that the Government ignored the Deputy's intentions, which were legitimately brought forward on behalf of a particular constituent.  I should be more than happy to go through that case with the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ferris and Deputy Sherlock raised the matter of eligibility.  Eligibility for medical cards has been the subject of some concern to the Minister and myself, there is no question about that.  There is a degree of concern about the lack of uniformity in the allocation of medical cards, and that concern goes back over a long period of time.  Many of us in the House are unhappy that during our work as public representatives we increasingly come across variations on the question of eligibility.  It is precisely for that reason that the Minister has decided to appoint an appeals officer to each health board area.  The appeals officer will have the responsibility of determining criteria for eligibility and will be available to individual members of the public or to public representatives should the need arise in order to clarify variations in eligibility. That system should work, and it will certainly help to take away the confusion and the hardship that can exist for individual medical card applicants who feel that their case has not been treated properly or fairly.</P>
      <P>The appointment of appeals officers will make a considerable difference and is a move that is certain to be welcomed. I should like to hear directly from the health boards their views on the question of a decrease in the number of people holding medical cards.  There could be a range of reasons for such an apparent reduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think the figures of variation are not very great in terms of the total number holding medical cards. Part of the reason could be the lack of uniformity in approach to the allocation of medical cards and the wording of medical cards, but the appeals officers appointed by the Minister will certainly deal with the issue in a full and fair manner.  That provision may help overcome some of the difficulties that have arisen in the allocation of medical cards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to hear that the Minister is bringing forward a charter on patients' rights.  Will that charter include a provision for patients in mental hospitals?  As the Minister is responsible for all health institutions, I presume that people in mental hospitals will be included.  I am particularly interested in the aspirations set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress:</i> the right of access to services in accordance with need; the right to privacy, the right to information, the right to respect for religious and philosophical beliefs and the right to make a complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this charter is brought forward will it deal with all the circumstances raised in this House last week, the kind of circumstance now governed by the 1945 Mental Health Act, which would have been dealt with to some extent by the legislation enacted in this House in 1981, which so far as I am aware never came into force?  Grave concern and distress are being caused with regard to patients' rights in this area.  Will a charter of rights be extended to these people, particularly those who are involuntarily committed to mental hospitals?  The Minister in his response last week said that there was adequate protection under legislation. Professor Anthony Clare also said that he was happy that there was adequate protection.  There is not adequate protection. Under existing legislation there are abuses and there is grave injustice.  I will catalogue 15 real cases with which I <Col N="286" /> have been presented.  This is a problem which must be dealt with.  I regret that my amendment was ruled out of order because its objective was to try to ensure that abuses will not occur.  I would much prefer to see that people were not committed to mental hospitals illegally or lawfully, than to have to deal with these circumstances.</P>

      <P>In all the instances of which I have been made aware where people were confronted by doctors with detention orders, action was instigated by husbands in marriages where there was great disharmony, and the doctors signed the committal orders without examining the patients.  The Garda and the ambulance were brought in and the person was taken away.  These people who were not patients at that time should have some rights.  I know there is an inquiry in progress and I welcome it.  I hope the Minister will be able to produce the results of that inquiry soon and let us know what happened in that case and in certain other cases which I am referring to the inspector. I hope people who have suffered so gravely will be compensated in advance of needed legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, brought my query down to an individual case.  An individual case is just an example.  I was referring to the broad principle of medical card holders being discriminated against in that they are being charged for a hospital stay when they stay in hospital for more than 30 days.  I am not talking about institutional care but care in an acute hospital.  Category 2 patients have to pay £12.50 per day to a maximum of £125.  After 30 days medical card holders must surrender from 90 per cent to 100 per cent of their pensions.  I do not want the Minister to say that he will look into an individual case.  I want to know if medical card holders are entitled to free hospital care when they stay more than 30 days in an acute hospital, because at the moment health boards are interpreting this in another way and are stopping pensions. I want the matter regularised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>That point should be clarified.  The most disappointing thing about what has happened in the health services is that, the capitation system of payment to doctors and pharmacists having been introduced, the cost of the GMS has increased.  Will the Minister give a reason for that?  Did somebody get the figures wrong or say that when we had a capitation system of payment to doctors and pharmacists we would be able to judge the outlay on the GMS scheme and consequently we would be able to contain the cost?  That apparently has not been the case and the cost has increased under the capitation system, over the fee per item system which obtained up to a couple of years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Bruton referred to what I would like to see in a charter and perhaps that is why he believes it cannot be implemented without legislation.  I referred to what we <Col N="288" /> intend to implement under the charter. There is a very high standard of patient care and patient service in Ireland.  The Irish people have a caring philosophy and nowhere is that better demonstrated than by the people working in our health services. We will ensure that what is in the charter will be implemented.  Everybody would agree, for instance, that it is not appropriate in this day and age that 40 patients should be brought to an outpatients department at 9 a.m., when it is known that at least half of them will not be seen before 11 or 12 o'clock.  That is the sort of consumer service that is very important.</P>

I assure the <Col N="290" /> Deputy that it will not have any effect and we will be dealing with that in section 9 of the Bill which provides that there will be no prejudice to EC regulations to which we are a party.</P>
      <P>It is fair to take the points raised by Deputy Sherlock now.  It is a question of balance; in theory, at present there is nothing to stop anybody coming into this country and claiming service, irrespective of where they come from.  We want to ensure that that does not happen. However, at the same time &mdash; this is the reason for the guidelines &mdash; we want to ensure that people who are legitimately in the country, or indeed our own citizens who may be abroad on a short-time basis or young Irish emigrants who might go to a non-European country, become ill and come home, will get treatment.  In spite of all that, the chief executive officer will still have discretion and I assure the House that nobody will be denied treatment in this country because of inability to pay.  That is our basic philosophy and position in this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen raised the question of long stay charges for patients.  Those charges have been in place since 1976 and the Deputy's Government were in office at the time.

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a very important statement that medical card holders who are receiving a service in an acute hospital are liable to charges in excess of the £12.50 per day.  Their pensons will be confiscated by the Department and they will be charged more than category 2 patients who are charged a maximum of £125 per year &mdash; £12.50 per day for ten days and a maximum of £125.  The Minister has admitted in the House that medical card holders receiving a service in an acute hospital can have their pension books confiscated by his Department, in other words they can be subject to a charge of over £2,000 per year.  Is that what the Minister is saying?  It is blatant discrimination against the least well off in our community and the Minister should be ashamed to admit it.  I am glad it took this long to get it out of him because they have skirted the problem and allowed health boards to get away with it for a long time, although it had been brought to the Minister's attention.  The Minister should now make an order retracting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We should sort out this problem now before there is an unnecessary row.  As I understand it, up to recently all health boards understood that the 1970 Act conferred rights on people who are medical card holders for acute hospital treatment, irrespective of the length of time they required the service. Under the 1970 Act there is no power to permit any health board to charge a medical card holder for acute hospital treatment as defined in the 1970 Act. There are regulations which permit health boards to charge anybody a percentage of their income if they are in long stay geriatric or psychiatric hospitals. That is understood because the 1970 Act was amended to define that as not being hospital service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, an acute hospital, I emphasise the word &ldquo;acute&rdquo; because the other interpretation was also used in sub-acute or district hospitals, means that after 30 days people could be considered as long <Col N="293" /> stay patients and not in hospital care.  We should clarify this matter once and for all because the public want to hear that medical card holders are entitled to free hospital treatment which is defined in the Act and redefined in the table.  If the Minister interprets it differently I should like to hear it.</P>
    <P>The House should adjourn if there is a question of the Act being suddenly taken out of context.  For a short time I did not believe that what Deputy Allen said could possibly happen in any health board area but I am glad he raised it, even though it is a contentious issue.  I read previous debates in relation to debt collectors and I understood it applied to long stay care only.  However, if it applies to medical card holders in acute hospital care we are deceiving everybody whom we represent.</P>

I referred to the 1976 regulations and I suggested that we should leave this issue until we come to the section dealing with charges in hospitals because this section deals with those ordinarily resident in the State.

      <P>Deputy Fennell referred to the patients' charter and asked if this will apply to patients in psychiatric hospitals.  The answer is that it will.  She then made very serious allegations with regard to admissions to psychiatric hospitals.  There is a careful legal procedure laid down.  Under the 1945 Act, before a person can be admitted to a psychiatric hospital a close relative of the person concerned, a community welfare officer or, in a specific emergency, other persons, can submit an application for recommendation for reception.  A recommendation order must then be signed.  In the case of admission to a private psychiatric hospital two doctors must sign the recommendation order and they must have seen the person concerned within specified times.  Finally, a reception order must be signed by a doctor in a psychiatric hospital.  They are fairly substantial safeguards.  I do not think Deputy Fennell is complaining about the safeguards that are there but rather that they were not adhered to. That is a different issue and a change in the law would not necessarily correct it. Procedures have been laid down to deal with cases where the procedures have not been adhered to.  Under the 1945 Act, a recommendation order must be signed by two doctors who must have seen the patient and a reception order by a doctor in the hospital who takes responsibility for the patient.  One is breaching the law in not adhering to the procedures but this does not mean that the law itself is defective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> Provision is made under the law for an inspector of mental hospitals to examine any complaint made.  As Deputy Fennell is aware, under that section an inquiry is being made into the specific case mentioned by her last week.  A charter of rights will apply but, as I have outlined, there are safeguards there at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister smugly attempted to suggest that I hold some particular views but the reality is that he is trying to conceal his unwillingness to give a patients' charter statutory force so that people could say that it was unacceptable that they have to wait for two years for a vital operation and the Government have guaranteed that they will not have to wait for that long, and they have redress.  That is what we are talking about&mdash; a patients' charter with legal force.  The Minister said he is implementing a charter.  If he is, and it is not aspirational at this stage, he should tell this to parents who have been trying for years to have a mentally handicapped child admitted to a residential home or to those who have been waiting for years for elective surgery.  The Minister does not have a patients' charter and he should face that fact.</P>
      <P>It is good that the Minister is willing to introduce a charter but we want it put on a statutory footing so that the people would be aware that health institutions would be obliged to make a reasonable effort to achieve its objectives.  The Minister is fooling no one in trying to suggest that he has a charter and that everything in the garden is rosy; that is not the reality.  If this charter is not legally underpinned, it will be nothing more than a pipe dream.  As the Minister knows, he does not have the right to tell the health agencies what they should do.  That is the reason the charter should be put on a statutory footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought when the Minister announced this morning that he was going to introduce a patients' charter that it would be a real charter but he subsequently said it would be announced <Col N="298" /> outside the House.  As I said, the aspiration in the programme agreed with the social partners are as good as his party's manifesto if the charter is not given the force of law by way of legislation or regulations.</P>
      <P>The only thing the patient is interested in is gaining access to services and any charter which does not give him that right legally enshrined will be worthless.  I am sick and tired of hearing the Minister say Pontius Pilate like that he is not aware of certain things.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be aware by now that the most important issue is that people cannot get public services when they want them but if they have the money they will get service overnight.  To talk about the terms of reference of a patients' charter is meaningless and will fool nobody, because the public, and especially patients, are interested only in access to in-patient, out-patient or community services, which they are not getting at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not right to say that patients are interested only in service. Certainly one of the issues that a patient is interested in is access to service in accordance with need, but clearly Deputy Allen is ignoring the other major items contained in the patients' charter.  The Minister has said that the patients' charter will be implemented and guarantees rights, for example, the right to privacy which is a basic and fundamental right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>How will a person get his or her rights under this charter if the provisions of the charter are not subject to regulation under the 1970 Health Act, or other legislation?  Will breaches of the provisions of the patients' charter be a matter for the Ombudsman, so that we could report the matter to him if the person does not get his or her rights?  The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, has said that a person is entitled to privacy.  That is a basic human right but at present, with ward closures, men and women may now be in the same hospital ward and this could not be in accordance with their right to privacy.  I am not talking about patients in intensive care units, but men and women in hospitals for acute care who have no privacy at present.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for State has made this announcement in this House but will this be a matter which can be raised with the Ombudsman when a person is aggrieved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had to raise breaches of people's existing legal rights with the Ombudsman, a simple matter such as a person having dental care under the Health Act <Col N="300" /> at the local clinic.  They had been told before all their teeth were extracted that they would be entitled to be supplied with dentures but the day the last tooth was extracted the health board pleaded inability to provide dentures.  I reported this case to the Ombudsman, and he considered the case so serious as to document in the 1990 report a case brought to his attention.  It was I who brought this case to his attention.  The health board pleaded their inability to pay for the dentures although under the 1970 Health Act the person is legally entitled to them. Whether a person is legally entitled or not, if the Minister does not provide the funding they cannot get the service.  The law is brought into disrepute because of that.  I want to check that the rights which the Minister has told us about, but which have no legal underpinning, can be raised with the Ombudsman so that he at least could pressurise the health board and Government Departments, by force of public opinion, to do something about patients' rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister can give us a grandiose list of patients' rights but I can give instances where existing rights under the law are not being respected.  I am not looking for spending <i>ad infinitum</i>, which the Minister seems to be accusing me of, but for priorities.  If the Department do not have priorities for the people entitled to a health care service at whatever level and if we are not honest with them, we are doing a disservice to those we represent. The Minister almost did not believe us when we told him that people were waiting for long times for this or that.  The Minister even asked Deputy Allen to give him details of a case when we told him that the service was available for people willing to pay for it.  This in fact is happening every day in the area of orthodontic treatment and other treatment areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Minister a list of people in the South Eastern Health Board area who are on the waiting list <Col N="301" /> for hip replacement operations.  In this health board area alone there are 2,500 people on the waiting list for in-patient service, and 5,000 patients on the out-patient list who are waiting to get on the inpatient list, making a total of over 7,000 people who have been referred by their GPs for treatment and are entitled by law to this service but cannot get it.  I can give the Minister details of the hospitals, the operations they are seeking and comparative dates of waiting lists for the previous year.  Yesterday I said that while there is increasing activity there are still waiting lists for the service.  The Minister said there will always be a waiting list; of course there will, but some people will have to wait up to eight years, as somebody was told yesterday, for an operation on varicose veins.  They will be in a wheelchair before they get the operation.</P>
      <P>Patients have rights, charter or otherwise, health estimates or otherwise.  They are entitled to the service but we cannot deliver it.  This is a great pity.  We say that the health services in Ireland are among the best in the world.  The Minister says that our health services are very good, are better than anywhere else, and that nobody will be without treatment, but still thousands upon thousands of people are waiting for treatment.  Obviously we are not able to meet the demands and therefore we are shirking our responsibility. That puts the patients' charter in context.  Although the charter has been approved in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and has the approval of the Minister, we still have to meet the people on the ground who cannot get a service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the points raised by Deputy Ferris and the other Deputies who raised similar points. We all recognise there are waiting lists.  I challenge any Deputy to come into this House and tell me the last time there was not a waiting list.  There were always waiting lists and unfortunately because of the nature of the health services there will continue to be waiting lists.  In Northern Ireland there were 800 people at one <Col N="302" /> point waiting for hip replacement operations, it was decided to provide the money to eliminate the waiting list altogether and that was done, but in three months there were 800 more people on the waiting list for hip replacement operations. No country in the world has discovered a means of eliminating waiting lists even when they put the money into the service.  I accept also that the length of time that some patients are on certain waiting lists is not acceptable but that is not a new feature of our health services either.  However, in the areas where we have identified that problem we have taken the appropriate action to deal with it.  I have referred to the hip replacement operations, and last year, for example, we increased the number of hip replacements by 14 per cent and in Cappagh Hospital, in particular, which is the largest provider of hip replacements, we increased the throughout of patients for hip replacement operations by 40 per cent.</P>

Unfortunately, waiting lists are a feature of every health service thoughout the world.  Every developed country has to deal with the problem of trying to meet increasing demands with limited resources.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ferris referred to the dental service.  I have recognised for years that the dental service was the cinderella service here, that it was under-funded. However, in 1979 an effort was made by the present Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Health, to come to grips with that and he established the <i>ad hoc</i> service whereby patients could go to a private dentist.  Who dismantled it?</P>

      <P>Again, it is an indication of the improvement of the services within the resources available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point raised was the question of medical cards.  It is true, as Deputy Allen said, that the cost of the general medical service is continuing to increase as has been the pattern for many years, but, on the question of the number of people covered by medical cards, the House appreciates that there was a change in the method of payment to <Col N="304" /> doctors.  Formerly doctors were paid on the basis of a fee for each item of service delivered.  Two years ago there was a change and doctors were paid on capitation. As the House will appreciate, from an administration point of view it did not very much matter if there were people on the register of medical card holders when the doctor was only paid when they turned up for a visit.  However, when the arrangement was made for doctors to be paid a capitation fee the doctor was paid for each person on his list of medical card holders irrespective of whether they visited him or not.  It became incumbent then on the health boards to address the issue of having the lists brought up to date.  Following that a number of patients' names were removed from the list because they had passed away, had left the area or for some other reason. That is the reason there was a sudden drop in the number of medical cards. The point Deputy Allen made about the increasing cost of the medical card service certainly indicates that there are still people, and more people in my view, benefiting from the medical card scheme.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the problem of the escalating cost of drugs.  Deputy Allen referred to the cost of the service this year.  It is too early to say what the outrun will be on the general medical service.  It is an open-ended scheme.  Patients turn up and medicines are prescribed for them, so it is not possible to say at this point what the outrun will be at the end of the year.  That has been the position every year since the scheme's inception in 1972.  We have adopted certain measures on the drugs side to try to contain the cost of medicines.  For example, we had an agreement with FICI last year that would reduce the bill to the State in the current year.  We also introduced a national formulary and as a result of the recent negotiations with the doctor in the GMS I am hopeful that we will be able to contain the cost of medicines.  Again, I have to tell the House that there are new medicines coming on stream every day, very expensive medicines, and the health services here provide the medicines that are appropriate to each patient <Col N="305" /> who needs them.  That feature of the health services will be continued, but there is a cost involved, and I am sure the House appreciates that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister first for dealing with my remarks because this is the first time I have spoken in the House about it.  I will not labour the point and I would prefer to speak to the Minister about it.  However, I would like to stress that if there was a charter that would give statutory rights to patients, the case I raised in the House last week, and those I have come across since, would not have happened.  If they did happen there would be redress for the person.  That is not the case.  There is no definition of what is an examination for those involuntary commitals under the 1945 Act and section 260 of it prevents persons bringing cases to the High Court.  I was anxious to put that on the record because I intend to talk to the Minister about the case.  A charter for patients under which they would have redress would certainly help prevent this happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed to hear the Minister say there are new drugs coming on stream.  We are always being told that there is no control over the drug companies and that appears to be the problem.  I was told that at the health board meeting when I raised this question of new drugs.  Who is monitoring them? Are they necessary?  Are they keeping people out of hospital?  There is no evidence of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the debate on a charter of patients' rights went on I did some thinking about it.  Much sorting out needs to be done about such a charter because I have now figured out that free access may not mean equal access.  In the fist instance the Government followed the recommendations of the Commission on Health Funding by abolishing the income limit. I support that wholeheartedly and it is about time it happened.  However, the Government did not adopt the recommendation that there should be a <Col N="306" /> common waiting list or the recommendation on the abolition of the tax allowance on VHI contributions.  We could still have public and private in the hospital system and, without a common waiting list, free access may not mean equal access.  There should be the right to equal treatment on the basis of need contained in a patients' charter, the right to equality of access and care when in hospital, and the right to information and access to one's medical records.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of the reform of the hospital services while maintaining a public and private mix in the public and general hospital service would ensure a quality of access and care for all and for additional private funds into the public system because there is an amount of public finance being spent on patient care in the private system.  Up to now consultants were paid their salaries by the health board while at the same time they were treating private patients in beds in the public hospitals and being paid by the VHI.  This is what we want to eliminate.</P>

      <P>The debate has really been about the charter.  On Deputy Sherlock's point, it is our intention to implement the charter.  Under section 72 of the Health Act, 1970 the Minister has authority to see that the charter is implemented.  We intend to do that. There will be equal access for people and a right of access.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to ensure that we will have a public health service and that there will be no queue jumping for the beds in the public health service.  The public beds will be available for public patients and they cannot be taken up by private patients. Deputy Allen said yesterday that 40 per cent of patients in public beds are private <Col N="307" /> patients.  It is unreasonable of him to say I was unaware of that.  I am unaware of it because I have no evidence of it and I ask him to produce the evidence.</P>

      <P>`(1)  The Minister may make regulations applicable to all health boards or to one or more than one health board regarding the manner in which and the extent to which the board or boards shall make available services under this Act and generally in relation to the administration of those services.' </P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 46 of the 1970 Health Act to provide that a person who does not have full eligibility but satisfies the residency requirement shall have limited eligibility.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for health services in Ireland is based on income.  There are at present three categories of eligibility.  Category 1, or medical card holders, are entitled to the full range of public hospital services free of charge.  The 1976 In-Patient Regulations which have been referred to already apply to category 1 in respect of hospitalisation after 30 days.</P>
      <P>Category 2, or hospital services card holders, are entitled to a public bed free of charge, except for the payment of modest statutory charges, the £10 out-patient charge and the £12.50 in-patient charge which is subject to a maximum of £125.00 in any period of 12 consecutive months.  Persons in Category 2 are also entitled to public consultant care in public hospitals free of charge, and expectant mothers in category 2 are entitled to free general practitioner services under the mother and infant care scheme.  Persons and their dependants are deemed to be eligible for category 2 services if their previous year's income is below a specified income limit.  The income limit for eligibility for category 2 services in the year ending 31 May 1991 is £16,700.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> The final category, category 3, is composed of persons and their dependants whose income is in excess of the income limit, that is £16,700.  Persons in this category are entitled to a public bed free of charge &mdash; except for the statutory charges I referred to in the context of category 2 &mdash; but are liable for public hospital consultant fees.  In addition expectant mothers in category 3 are not entitled to free general practitioner services under the mother and infant care scheme.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 3 is that in future there will be just two categories of eligibility.  Persons with full eligibility, that is, medical card holders, will continue to be entitled to all necessary medical care free of charge.  The remainder of the population will have limited eligibility and will therefore be entitled to the services currently available to those in category 2.  The practical effect of this change is that persons in category 3 will now be entitled to public consultant services free of charge and expectant mothers in category 3 will now be eligible for free general practitioner services under the mother and infant care scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements the hospital services card will no longer be issued.  Provided a person is a resident of Ireland he or she will not require any evidence of eligibility in order to avail of public hospital services.</P>
    <P>The arguments for the extension of eligibility, that is, the abolition of the income limit for category 2 services, were discussed in detail in my speech on Second Stage.  In brief, the present system is no longer equitable as it is impossible to operate the income limit fairly, and because the existence of category 3 can in practice work against equitable access to public beds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday on Second Stage we made it clear that Fine Gael did not feel this was a priority in our health services at the moment.  I am not convinced that the Minister has removed an administrative problem with the income limit.  We have had income limits for all sorts of services and it does not seem a fundamental issue just because there is a <Col N="310" /> change in self-assessment or in the provisions of the income tax code.</P>
      <P>The other point the Minister makes is not a fundamental reason for queue jumping.  It is not that private patients are being put into public beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Deputy Allen said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental reason for queue jumping is people having money in their pockets.  What is very disturbing about the new provision is that the Minister is deciding there are to be two separate streams, a public waiting list and a private waiting list.  I will have to go back to the Health Commission whom the Minister is always quoting in support of his case.  Yes, the commission favoured the eligibility limit and providing care to all, but it was on one fundamental condition which they spelled out, that there be a common waiting list.</P>
      <P>What the commission say is worth reading into the record because it is fundamental to the way we think of it.  They say that there is a major problem regarding access to public hospitals.  The common perception is that those opting for private care are able to obtain admission more quickly than those using the public system.  They say an objective system of assessment for access to public hospitals should be introduced for all planned admissions involving a common waiting list for both public and private patients from which cases would be taken in order of medically established priority. The new approach would require the regular publication of criteria for hospital admission and of maximum waiting periods for access to specific non-emergency procedures.  The operation of the common admissions policy would have to be monitored closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the Health Commission's fundamental proposal which this Bill is ignoring.  They saw as fundamental extending cover to everyone but on condition that there was a common waiting list being operated.  There would be clear specified maximum waiting periods and <Col N="311" /> people would not have to wait beyond a certain acceptable level to gain admission to hospital.  By adopting one half of the commission's recommendation and not the other, the Minister is neutering what they were trying to do.  By saying that everyone will be eligible but that there will not be a common waiting list the Minister will reinforce the problem all of us believe exists in the health services.  I want to give the reason this problem will be with us in the years to come.  The Minister wants people to stay in the VHI because, obviously, he does not want those 30 per cent becoming a drain on his Department's budget.  The only way people will stay in the VHI is if the public service, to which the Minister says they will now be fully entitled, is sufficiently inferior that they cannot get the care they want.  These people will have to continue scrimping and saving to come up with the £500, or whatever amount is necessary, to get VHI cover for their family.</P>
    <P>The Minister is ignoring this point.  He has not at any stage in the debate addressed the issue of the common waiting list. Neither has he said why he believes the people to whom he is now giving cover should not take it up.  The reason people will not take up the costless consultant care the Minister is giving them is that they believe, on the basis of the evidence before them, that they will not get the care when they need it and that they will be placed on long waiting lists.</P>
    <P>If free health care at an acceptable level were available to all Irish people we would not be in the VHI, we would all avail of the public system.  This is why the jettisoning of the common waiting list proposed by the Health Commission is so serious.  The Minister must explain to the House why he believes this extension of care will be costless.  He keeps insisting that there will not be an extra burden, he will not put any more money into the system and he will not make any more public beds available.  The fundamental underpinning his ability to say this is that he knows in his heart of hearts that the public health service will be sufficiently <Col N="312" /> inferior to the private health service that people will not exercise their rights.  The commission tried to address that equity question.  That is the principle Gleeson tried to address in working out a system of payment to the consultants which would give them the incentive to operate the system fairly and not give them incentives to favour and promote their private patients in order to secure financial return.  Gleeson did not want to just give them money; he wanted to set up a system whereby the Department would have an agreement with the consultants that they would police the common waiting list deal.  As I understand it, that was the fundamental principle in those two documents.  Much of what was in those documents has been turned on its head by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The separation of public and private patients and the earmarking of beds is a rather crude way of policing the system when Gleeson was offering a system of monitoring through actual admissions of patients.  That is what we are talking about.  We do not want beds people can hang hats on; we want to see public and private patients getting a fair share out. I understood this was what the Gleeson commission were all about.  I am genuinely afraid that with the £35 million payment to the consultants we will be dropping the pass in respect of what the Health Commission proposed as the ideal way for us to proceed.</P>
    <P>Section 3 proposes to extend eligibility. If the Government are to extend eligibility, no politician would deny more people access to care.  However, I question the thinking underpinning this proposal and whether we can put our hands on our hearts and say that this is in some way an answer to the Health Commission's report which was all about equity, common waiting lists and giving patients, whether public or private&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the extension of eligibility to this service to everybody.  Even the previous speaker welcomed this proposal.  However, the only way the Minister can achieve this is by providing a service for everyone.  At present those who are entitled to the service &mdash; those who have full eligibility, those paying PRSI contributions and those paying the £12.50 a day charge &mdash; cannot get it.  People in the VHI who could be accommodated under this section will remain in the VHI because they know that if they do not remain in the VHI there is no guarantee that the queue they will join will be shorter, particularly if the number of beds stays <Col N="314" /> the same, which I suspect it will.  This is why I put down an amendment to a later section.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to some of the comments made by the Minister on this section.  He referred to the section of the Health Act, 1970 covering the three existing eligible categories, one of which will be abolished.  The Minister said the first category included people with medical cards who are entitled to full and free services in a public hospital.  Is it not time the Minister addressed the problem we raised previously with him, the eligibility of medical card holders who are in acute hospitals for over 30 days?  The Minister has just confirmed that these people are entitled to beds in public hospitals but can he now confirm that everybody with a medical card will be entitled to a free bed in public and acute hospitals after 30 days?  Although sub-acute hospitals are public hospitals, they can be redefined under the amended regulations which have been brought in.  Will the Minister answer that question?  It is a good time for him to answer it as he proposes to introduce a new category of people who will be eligible.</P>

They pay up to £300 or £400 a year extra and are getting what I would term a ramshackle service.  They are just being added to the waiting lists.  They are now entitled to a service that is full of waiting lists and inequalities.  That is what they will get for their extra contribution. Those with medical cards and hospital service cards will find it more difficult to avail themselves of the service because of the influx of new people.</P>
      <P>In his Second Stage contribution yesterday, the Minister said category 1 persons would be entitled to the medical card and would receive all the services free of charge.  It is now time for the Minister to come clean on what the medical card holder is entitled to.  Is the medical card holder entitled to acute hospital care over 30 days, be it at a general hospital or a psychiatric hospital?  I have in mind the person who is in and out of hospital for five or six days, home for two months, in for another eight or nine days, home again and is not fully recovered and has to return for further treatment and exceeds the 30 days.  Is such a medical card holder entitled to free hospital services or is he discriminated against <i>vis-à-vis</i> category?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill reflects the ethos of the Government in that it extends eligibility to a section who have not sought this benefit at the expense of those who currently cannot gain access to an adequate level of medical care.  This is most regrettable.  The inbuilt departmental and ministerial policy is the perpetuation of a two-tier medical system. This section budgets unequivocally for the fact that the public patient service will remain significantly less attractive to ensure that those to whom eligibility is being extended will not avail of it and will maintain their membership of the VHI.  It will maintain the gap between the level of service available to public patients and that available to those to whom eligibility is being extended.  This is regrettable coming from a Minister who insists that access to treatment on the grounds of medical need is the guiding principle.  This section explodes that myth.  It will be obligatory on the Minister to ensure that there is a gap in the standard of health service available to medical card holders and that available to others, yet the Minister claims that the two tier system does not exist.  It is unfortunate that the Minister does not take into account the global recommendations of the commission on health funding. <Col N="322" /> That commission recommended a single waiting list for public and private patients.  The divisive nature of the health service is being perpetuated.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Browne does not want to listen to the Chair, he has his option.  This is a Committee Stage debate on what has been described as very sensitive legislation. You could have fooled the Chair.  Is it sensitive or is it not?  I do not propose to delay the proceedings but I will be intolerant of any interruption when any Member is making his contribution. Committee Stage allows Deputies to take <Col N="323" /> issue in the normal way but let us not give the appearance of a football match or something in the national boxing stadium to something which is a sensitive matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Chair. Deputy Creed stated that I had said there was no two-tier health system.  I have said no such thing.  I have defended, both in Opposition and in Government, the integrated private-public mix which has served the people well and ensured that the very best consultants are available to public patients.  Private practice in public hospitals ensures that consultants are available to public patients for most of the day, particularly when consultants do not work outside a particular hospital.</P>
      <P>Regarding the common waiting list, the recommendation from the Commission on Health Funding relied on the monitoring of admissions to ensure that private patients were not admitted to available beds ahead of public patients with greater medical need.  There would be tremendous difficulty with this recommendation in practice.  The decision to admit a specific patient is a clinical decision and must always remain a clinical decision and the responsibility of the consultant.  Effectively there would be a common waiting list with private and public patients, but the consultant would decide which patient was due to come in next.  For this reason the Government and the social partners believe that public patients would be best protected by ensuring that for non-emergency treatment public beds are available exclusively to public patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, it is very much in the interest of the public hospital system and the public patient to maintain the balanced mix of public and private care in public hospitals.  The public patients benefit from the availability of the best and most skilled consultants who can be retained in the public hospital system because of the opportunities for private practice there.  Under the new arrangements any increased demand for private care can be met by expanding the number of private and semi-private beds in public hospitals <Col N="324" /> without any disadvantage to the public patient.  This expansion will be possible because it will be self-funding.  If, however, a common waiting list applied to those beds such an expansion would not be possible and the likelihood is that the focus of private practice would begin to move away from the public hospital.  I do not support that and neither did Deputy Ferris support it last night on Second Stage.  In the long term this would not be in the best interests of public patients.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised earlier which I said I would come back to is the question of in-patient services regulations and who they apply to.  These regulations were first introduced in 1976 by Brendan Corish who was then Minister for Health and signed by Richie Ryan, then Minister for Finance.  They allowed for charges for in-patient services to all patients entitled to section 52 services.  In other words they applied to everybody.  The regulations now refer to patients in hospital for over 30 days.  It is a matter for the chief executive officer of the health boards to make a decision regarding these patients.  This is not a new measure.  The practice in most health board areas has been that when a patient was in hospital for 30 days the chief executive officer decided they were no longer entitled to a medical card because they were being maintained in the hospital.  That has been the practice right back to 1976.  Not very many patients are hospitalised in acute hospitals for longer than 30 days.  There is a variation from one health board to another.  We are in the process of reviewing the legislation introduced by the Fine Gael Government when they were in power as it affects patients in acute hospitals.  As of now it is a matter for the chief executive officer at the end of 30 days to decide whether a patient is still entitled to a medical card.  As the Deputy knows from replies he has received to parliamentary questions, this measure has applied in a uniform way to patients in long stay hospitals throughout the country.  However there is a variation in regard to acute hospitals.</P>

      <P>I am interested in the medical card holder who as the Minister has stated, is liable to hospital charges.  This measure is much more pernicious than the measure relating to the category 2 patient, in other words the man with the hospital services card.  That person is liable for a maximum of £125 per year whereas, as a result of this measure, the medical card holder could be liable for up to £1,500 or £2,000 per year if he is in hospital for over 30 days.  This is the way the health boards are interpreting the regulation.  A medical card holder with a State pension must surrender his pension after 30 days in hospital and that pension could be £40 to £60 per week.  That is a blatant discrimination against the medical card holder.  Irrespective of who brought in the measure the Minister should move immediately to eliminate this most unfair practice.</P>

      <P>Again Deputy Allen is extending the debate. What we are dealing with here in section 3 is whether those who hitherto did not have full eligibility but who now satisfy the requirement are now eligible. Matters extraneous to that are not proper on section 3.  The Deputy said the Minister referred to this point but I presume he was courteously replying to a question that was out of order.  We must confine ourselves to what is in the section.</P>

I said that if it was left until such time as we were dealing with charges &mdash; we are still not dealing with charges &mdash; I would respond to the Deputies.  In order to finalise the matter, there is no mystery here today. The same information was given to Deputy Allen in a letter in April 1991&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;regarding the specific regulations and charges.  What I am clarifying for Deputy Allen is that the regulations introduced in 1976 apply to acute hospitals in the same way as to long <Col N="327" /> stay hospitals.  I informed Deputy Allen that because there is a variation in different health board areas in regard to acute hospitals I would examine the matter, and we are in the process of doing that.  That should conclude the issue and I will not be coming back to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to come back to this matter either.  What the Minister said is correct in that we should wait for another section to raise this subject.  In introducing the section the Minister referred to eligibility of medical card holders in public hospitals, and that raised the previous problem.  I asked if it was appropriate, since he had raised it, to address this problem, and he has addressed it in a mysterious way.  He said this is normal practice.  It has not been normal practice for medical card holders to be charged by health boards for medical services in an acute hospital.  Regulations were introduced in 1976 and amended by the Minister in 1987, allowing him to impose charges on people in another category.  However, that never interfered with the rights of medical card holders, which is the only subject we are talking about.  Accusations can be made of any Minister, dead or alive, for regulations they brought in, but the basic question is whether the provisions became operational.</P>

      <P>I apologise, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  My colleague, Deputy Howlin, who was previously our spokesman on health, brought to the attention <Col N="328" /> of the present Minister for Health the matter of a specific hospital that had implemented these charges.  The Minister said that the charges were incorrect, he notified the health board of that, and the health board withdrew the charges and refunded the money.  It was always intended that people with a medical card with full eligibility in an acute hospital were entitled to services.  No chief executive officer, irrespective of the powers held &mdash; and chief executive officers do have powers under this legislation and under the 1970 legislation &mdash;should be empowered to withdraw a medical card from someone whose income has not changed but who has been in hospital for more than a prescribed number of days. That has nothing to do with eligibility. The legal position is that medical cards are given on the basis of eligibility, and that is provided in the 1970 legislation.  It comes within the remit of the Ombudsman and is provided for in other legislation.</P>

However, to be orderly, I am prepared to wait for debate on the next section and discuss the matter again. The public of Ireland, whether they live in Deputy Callely's constituency or in another constituency, are entitled to know whether they are eligible for services in an acute hospital if they have a medical card.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a worthwhile contribution on the section, and, in fairness, I should have the opportunity to respond to the points he made.</P>
      <P>The point I make is that although the Minister said the common waiting list concept was not operable because consultants make clinical decisions, and they are the ones who make those decisions in the final analysis, I feel that clinical decisions by their very nature are decisions made on the grounds of greatest medical need.  The essence of a clinical decision is to discern who is in greatest medical need.  It is not acceptable for the Minister to suggest that because consultants take clinical decisions, decisions cannot be made on the basis of medical need.  Clinical decisions are <i>ipso facto</i> ones that should be made on the basis of medical need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that there is a problem in relation to monitoring of the common waiting list.  Gleeson examined that problem and provided both for full disclosure of information and a system of annual review of the actual mix.  That was the tool offered by the Gleeson Commission and the other commission to make possible the operation of the common waiting <Col N="331" /> list.  That was what all of us wanted.  I have no objection to a requirement that public beds be used exclusively by the public, but under the Gleeson recommendations the Minister could have had the common waiting list under a common contract without losing the consultants to private hospitals.  I do not believe that consultants would decamp in vast numbers. That is my attitude to the Minister's defence of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the regulations under section 53 that enable charges to be made, and I should like him to come back to that matter.  It is clearly stated that the imposition of charges for inpatient services is to persons who do not have full eligibility &mdash; the section provides only for persons who do not have full eligibility, and they are the people who are being charged in the cases made by Deputy Allen and Deputy Ferris.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with the last point first.  In a very detailed letter from my colleague, Deputy Chris Flood, to Deputy Allen it was pointed out how those institutional charges work.  These are charges which have been in place for 17 years so they are not news.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am saying is that the 1976 regulations apply equally to acute hospitals and long-stay hospitals. There has been a variation and they are not used in several acute hospitals.  The fact that they are causing a problem in acute hospitals is being addressed by the Government in order to find out whether something needs to be done.  The regulations are the same and the way in which they apply to medical card holders has been pointed out in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I draw attention to the fact that a letter is being quoted selectively.  I raised the issue of a 60-year-old person, a pensioner, who was <Col N="332" /> a medical card holder and who was in an acute hospital for more than 30 days within one year at different periods.  In that case it was not institutional care or long-stay care that was involved, it was short term care at different times during one year in an acute psychiatric hospital. The Minister should not try to mislead anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify something with the Minister.  The 1976 regulations, brought in by the late Brendan Corish, empowered Ministers &mdash; and that was amended in subsequent Acts &mdash; to make charges on people who were not eligible for full entitlement, people who were not eligible for medical cards.  I am sure the Minister did not want to mislead the House, but he said that a chief executive officer had the power to withdraw a person's medical card while that person was in hospital for an extended period.  Chief executive officers would not have that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>How can a medical card be withdrawn from someone who is entitled by law to it?  The goalposts cannot be changed in the middle of the game.  How could any Minister or any executive of a health board decide that a person who had a medical card was no longer eligible just because they were unfortunate enough to be in hospital for an extended period?  The 1970 legislation does not allow for charges to be made to people who are eligible for free service in an acute hospital.  The Minister has been in his Ministry for long enough now &mdash; he has been there for four years with the present Government in coalition with the Progressive Democrats and previously in a minority Government &mdash; and it is time for him to tidy up that regulation so that there are no anomalies.  I shall say no more about the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of redundancies notified to my Department under the Redundancy Payments Acts in April 1991 was 1,486 compared to 590 in April 1990 which was an exceptionally low monthly figure.  The total number of redundancies notified for the first four months of 1991 was 5,829.  The figures for the corresponding periods in 1989 and 1990 were 5,403 and 4,097 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that his Government refused to agree to an all-party committee on employment.  Would he not accept that registered unemployment is now at an all-time record, that those on short-time are at an all-time high and that emigration over the past four years has been twice the rate of the preceding four years and that redundancies are higher than they were in the last two years?  In the light of those facts would the Minister not accept that there is a need for an all-party approach to this problem?</P>

      <P>Question No. 3 <Col N="338" /> in the name of the Deputy is essentially statistical and matters of policy should not therefore arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The redundancy figures for the first quarter are higher than for the same quarter last year but taking into account the global recession and the temporary dislocation of business during the Gulf crisis, the figures for January and February were not particularly large. The figures for the first four months, while higher than those for the first four months last year, are not too bad and I hope the figures will not continue to rise. There were very high redundancies in a number of companies during the first few months of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, like the rest of his administration is complacent. The figures for redundancies for the first four months represent an annual rate of 20,000 redundancies, when unemployment is already at an all-time high and emigration is twice what it was before this Government came into office.  Has the Minister any plan to stop the rot and restore employment to those who need it?</P>

      <P>I just want to confirm that the figure for the last first quarter, at 5,800, is lower than the figures would have been right through the eighties.  The figure is certainly higher than it was last year or the year before but it is nothing major.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>
      <Quest>if, in the light of the recent ESB dispute, the Industrial Relations Commission have been asked to draw up codes of practice for industrial relations in the electricity industry; when such codes are likely to be drafted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>One of the functions of the Labour Relations Commission, as provided in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, is to prepare codes of practice on various areas of industrial relations.  Earlier this year I suggested to the Labour Relations Commission a number of issues, including essential services, on which codes might be prepared and the commission had already begun work in this area.  Arising from the recent dispute in the ESB, priority is being given to the preparation of a code of practice on dispute procedures and levels of cover to be provided in relation to disputes in essential services.  In drawing up the code the commission will consult employer and union organisations and it is expected that the code will be finalised within months.  The Act empowers me on receipt of the code from the commission to make an order declaring that the code is a code of practice for the purposes of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm whether in the work which is underway to draw up codes of good practice in the energy industry, account will be specifically taken of the fact that the early warning system in the recent dispute failed and that the country was taken completely unawares as, apparently, were the management of the ESB?  The result was that large sections of the country were plunged into darkness and many areas of industry put at risk.  Will this specific area be provided for in any new code of industrial practice which is likely to emerge?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is the short answer.  At Question Time at the end of the dispute I gave a commitment to undertake a confidential examination within the Department with all the various interests in relation to what happened the early warning system.  A report is being prepared at the moment and I have had an opportunity over the last four weeks of seeing why it happened. Such an arrangement must be built into a particular code.  I have also had the opportunity of seeing the hard reality, in cash terms, of what was lost to the economy and the country during the dispute. One company alone lost £250,000 and I am very conscious that a new code should reflect those difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's approach in the calm of reflection in regard to this problem.  Will he agree that any mandatory system of outlawing dispute action in the public utilities would be contrary to the essence of collective bargaining which is characterised by the Labour Relations Commission system? Some areas of the public service do not have the clout of the energy industry, for example, health workers who have to remain at their posts notwithstanding their depth of grievance in relation to whom there was not the same public outcry as in the case of the ESB for mandatory action.  There should be a general underpinning by good codes of practice on a voluntary basis to &mdash; I hope &mdash; avert this kind of dispute in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Codes of practice can make an important contribution to the promotion of good industrial relations as they provide practical guidance for employers and unions in relation to standards of good behaviour and particular aspects of industrial relations.  They can also clarify the respective rights and responsibilities of unions and managements. Deputies Jim Mitchell, Rabbitte and Toddy O'Sullivan took a major part in the debate of the dispute and they are aware that codes of practice are not legally binding.  However, they should foster good practice and encourage <Col N="341" /> reasonable behaviour in accordance with widely held standards.  If mandatory arrangements are brought in by legislation or otherwise, they will fail to achieve the purposes I set out and prove to be counter-productive.  I have given examples in that regard; It is very easy to have statutory provisions &mdash; as other countries have &mdash; which cannot be enforced in a major dispute.  Therefore, voluntary codes of practice will achieve far more, they may not eliminate every essential service dispute forever but they will negative the damage of some and eliminate others.  Codes of practice are a far more sensible approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 5 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The whole question of Government policy to tackle the recent increase in unemployment, including the establishment of an all-party committee on unemployment, was dealt with in the course of the debate in the Dáil on Tuesday, 21 May 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my statement I referred to the increase in jobs during the peiod of the <Col N="342" /><i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and to the wide range of measures, to which the Government are totally committed, to stimulate growth and to generate employment.</P>
    <P>Job creation is the number one priority and the Government are determined not to be deflected from the current strategy, agreed with all the major interests, to achieve the programme's economic and social objectives.</P>
    <P>I accept that due to the Gulf War, coupled with the recessionary difficulties in the United Kingdom and the United States and a general slowing down in world trade, there has been a disappointing but temporary rise in unemployment here.  We have to resist the temptation, however, to resort to panic measures which, in the long run, can prove counter-productive.</P>
    <P>Since Tuesday's debate the ESRI have published their quarterly economic commentary and the OECD economic survey of Ireland has also been published.  Both independent studies have endorsed current policies and expect that GNP will continue to grow at a robust rate with a continuing low inflation rate.</P>
    <P>There can be no jobs without growth. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> demonstrated what can be achieved when there is consensus on the broad economic strategy and employment targets.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is based on the same consensual approach and, I have no doubt, will be equally successful.</P>
    <P>The central review committee enables representatives of all the major interests to meet regularly with representatives of Government to review and to make recommendations on developments under the programme.  In this way the social partners, who are at the forefront of action on job creation, have a direct, on-going input into the Government's decision-making process on economic and social policy.</P>
    <P>I believe that the committee satisfactorily fulfil their role and I do not see the need for the setting up of further bodies such as a separate national forum on unemployment.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister tell the House whether this idea was put forward during the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> discussions? The unions sought the setting up of a forum of this kind to tackle the problem of unemployment.  The Minister said he would resist the temptation to resort to panic measures but this is the greatest problem facing the Government and, if anything, we have been inactive in this regard.  Every Member must share the blame.  However, in his speech last week the Minister did not give encouragement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

During the first quarter there was an international slowdown and unemployment increased rapidly in countries which are trading partners.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the IDA and CTT, is trying to attract new investment and to help indigenous investment which will halt the slide of unemployment.  I hope it will also create new jobs.  I am not saying <Col N="344" /> that Deputy O'Sullivan is complacent but it would be wrong, on the advice we got from the ESRI, OECD and other independent people, to rush into generating jobs in the public sector which would be counter-productive in the long term.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos 7, 35 and 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals to amend the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, are being finalised and will be introduced this year in line with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social <Col N="346" /> Progress.</i>  I do not wish at this stage to comment on the detailed provisions of the proposed amendments, other than to confirm &mdash; as I indicated to this House on 20 November &mdash; that I intend to bring forward one single updated Act and that the matters raised by the Deputies were being examined in the process of updating the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the problems with the Pay Acts is that where staff consists entirely of women, they find it very difficult to prove a case for equal pay because there is not what is known as a male comparator involved in the employment? Does the Minister propose to rectify this anomaly in the legislation he is bringing forward and ensure that at the very least the concept of a &ldquo;notional man&rdquo; is incorporated in the legislation so that women who find themselves in this position will not continue to be discriminated against?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong to discuss the details of the legislation as it has not been finalised and the matter is still being discussed with the various agencies.  As the Deputy has said, difficulties are being encountered due to the lack of a male comparator.  Where there is no male comparator it is difficult to compare the work being done by two people in the same line of work.  There is merit in the argument therefore that one should look for a male comparator or a former employee who filled the post now filled by a female so that one can make a fair comparison.  With regard to the examples cited by the Deputy, I am considering the suggestion that where there is no male comparator, one should try to compare the work done by the female with the work being done by a male comparator in another company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that women's pay lags so far behind that of their male comparators in industry, would the Minister agree that the legislation has now largely <Col N="347" /> served its purpose?  Would he also indicate if one of the areas being considered is the burden of proof to establish cases? It is unfair that the employee is required to establish the case.  Does the Minister believe he will meet the deadline envisaged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>?</P>

      <P>The Minister did not respond to Question No. 36.  With regard to the male comparator, while I accept the points made by Deputies De Rossa and Rabbitte, I believe there is an implication here that the work done by women does not have the same value as the work done by men.  It is dangerous to use the work done by men as a yardstick because, in effect one is assuming that the work being done by women is of less value.  That matter has to be addressed in considering any anti-discrimination legislation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, <Col N="348" /> I have been encouraging the Department of Defence to adopt this policy with some success.  However, the Department of Defence are concerned that the total removal of this provision could lead to difficulties.  While they have appointed female officers and apprentices, they are considering ways in which they will be able to comply fully with the terms of the legislation.  According to information recently received, it would appear that the Departments of Defence in other countries seem to adopt the same view. However our Department of Defence are moving in the right direction.  We started this process in 1988.</P>

      <P>While the Constitution guarantees workers the right of freedom of association and the right to form trade unions, it does not place any obligation on employers to recognise trade unions for the purposes of collective bargaining. As Minister for Labour, I believe that in the interest of good industrial relations, where workers wish to be represented by trade unions, employers, regardless of whether they are Irish or foreign, should recogise the trade unions and engage in collective bargaining.  However, in keeping with the voluntary nature of our industrial relations system, I feel that trade union representation and recognition is essentially a matter which must be resolved between the parties involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of trade union recognition was among the issues discussed in the negotiations on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  It is provided in the programme that the Employer Labour Conference will, during the period of the programme, <Col N="349" /> review all the issues involved and report on the matter to the constituent bodies of the conference.</P>

For example, not that long ago the Industrial Development Authority encouraged foreign owned companies to meet with the trade unions and allow their workforce to organise. However, some multi-national companies, and indeed some domestic companies, seem to have an aversion to trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some merit in what the Deputy said.  I think it was Deputy Rabbitte who raised the issue of Industrial Development Authority letters with me last year and how they had changed over the years.  I gave an undertaking at that stage to encourage them to adopt a more positive approach.  The Industrial Development Authority when offering grant assistance to foreign companies, or indeed any company, ask that management undertake to recognise the constitutional rights of Irish workers to trade union membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We asked the IDA to have the medium and large manufacturing projects which were set up during the period of the programme, from 1988 to 1990, surveyed on trade union organisation and that showed that slightly over 50 per cent were unionised but the representation of workers in numerical terms was about 60:40.  I would be happier if we could increase the number of unionised workers and I have made that clear both to the Federation of Irish Employers, to the CII and to congress.  One of the points I have used in support of that is that traditionally in the foreign multi-national companies based here we have had a very good record with regard to strike statistics and they have nothing to fear <Col N="350" /> based on the statistics in bad years as well as good years.  I certainly hope that the company management would support and continue to support the unionisation of their workforce.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that we are reaching a danger point when 40 per cent of the workforce are outside the agreement and will be excluded from any future agreements between the social partners?  We have had good industrial relations and industrial stability for the past number of years.  I believe the current trend is likely to undermine that.  Would the Minister agree that he should legislate to ensure that unions are recognised in any company setting up here?  We have proved that the trade unions can work effectively with the multi-national companies.  The Minister has a precedent and the companies have ample evidence that they have nothing to fear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation would represent a very fundamental change in the system of free collective bargaining and I do not think it would be welcomed by either side.  We have a job to do in continuing to encourage firms by showing them the statistics.  I have issued the statistics and have tried to highlight the positive elements to the IDA and as Deputy Rabbitte has said, they should take a stronger line, as they did in previous years.</P>
      <P>With regard to the assertion that the companies were not involved in the recent agreement, that would not be correct because many of these companies would be members of the Federation of Irish Employers and would be tied into the discussions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 15 and 18 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no plans at the moment in respect of either longer maternity leave <Col N="352" /> or paternity leave.  In my view the legislation we have at the moment is working satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The question of the protection for pregnant workers is currently the subject of consideration at Community level. The EC Commission has, as part of its overall social action programme for the implementation of the Social Charter, made a proposal for a directive concerning the protection at work of pregnant women, and women who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. This proposal is being considered by the Social Questions working party of the Council and does not include any provision in relation to paternity leave.  The main provisions of the draft directive relate to ensuring safe work for pregnant women and the provision of 14 weeks maternity leave.  It is expected that a draft directive will be considered by the Social Affairs Council on 25 June.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the problems experienced by working mothers who are adopting a child.  I am at present examining this issue and, when I have completed the examination, I will consider the options which are available.  Deputies will appreciate, however, that the question of adoptive leave involves many complex issues which require special consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to ask the Minister about the complexities of working mothers who are adopting a child but I note what he has said.  In the Minister's view is it likely that the outcome of the discussions going on in Europe will take on board any of the recommendations made by the Council for the Status of Women in respect of maternity leave and would he further accept that there is a question of equality in terms of the paternity leave aspect?  During the recent debate on the Finance Bill, the Minister for Finance advanced as his reason for not being able to take on board a particularly critical amendment the constitutional aspiration to protect the family, which is really at the heart of the issue we are talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of discussion on the social action programme which is one of the major aspects of the Social Charter.  The main proposals in the draft directive, and four are worth putting on the record of the House are, first, the provision for transfer to alternative duties with pay and employment rights being maintained where a pregnant or breast feeding woman's job may endanger health and safety; second, there is the availability of the alternative to night work for a 14 week period around the time of child birth and for a longer period, if certified necessary.  The alternative to night work may constitute a transfer to day work or provision of social security benefit or extension of maternity leave.  Again, employment rights are to be maintained.  Third, there is the provision of 14 weeks maternity leave on full pay and-or a corresponding allowance, and, lastly, the prohibition of dismissal for reasons connected with pregnancy and maternity.  That is in our own legislation under the Protection of Employees Act, 1991, where a woman cannot be dismissed on the basis of anything to do with the fact that she is pregnant or involved in antenatal or postnatal care.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has given consideration to providing leave for adoptive parents and I look forward to reading the report. In the course of his replies to the question and to the supplementary questions, the Minister referred to the Social Charter but is it not a fact that Britian and Ireland have been criticised for the non-implementation of the conditions of the Social Charter?  A report from Europe on maternity leave for those in part-time employment arrived in the Library this week.  As the existing legislation does not cover those in part-time employment, would the Minister be prepared to consider providing maternity leave for women in part-time employment?  At present they do not enjoy the benefits of those engaged in full-time employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>There is a number of questions.  First let me say that I am <Col N="354" /> extremely supportive, both as a Minister and personally, of the changes in this area.  There are some aspects of the Social Charter, where I am directly concerned, to do with employment and the long term unemployed but certainly not in this area. It was at the behest of Deputy Shatter who made a good point regarding adoptive leave that I examined the question. Deputy Rabbitte raised what is the major problem, that is, if you try to provide leave for a parent adopting a child you run into all sorts of difficulties so at an appropriate time I would like to talk to my colleagues and the party spokespersons about this.  In order to bring forward legislation I would have to have their support, otherwise I would run into all sorts of difficulties on equality and other related aspects.  I am examining that report.  The areas I have outlined are certainly areas that I am supporting and at the next meeting of the Commission on 26 June I hope we will get to the penultimate draft.  The Irish Government have been supporting the proposals of the Social Questions working party over the past few weeks.</P>

      <P>FÁS, through their training activities and employment schemes, provide assistance for the long term unemployed to assist them return to <Col N="355" /> the workforce.  Over 2,000 will be trained this year on the alternance training programme which is aimed at the long term unemployed and an average of 10,500 people will participate each week on the social employment scheme.  The employment incentive scheme provides assistance to employers to encourage them to recruit long term unemployed people and FÁS expect that about 1,000 long term unemployed people will be assisted into employment this year through the scheme.  FÁS will continue to co-operate with the Department of Social Welfare in the provision of counselling and training of unemployed persons through Job-search.</P>
      <P>With regard to other measures, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> includes proposals for an area based response to long term unemployment. The strategy is area based and local communities are the primary movers.  Twelve locations have been selected for pilot projects and local companies have already been established in a number of the areas.</P>
      <P>The remaining areas will have companies in a matter of weeks.  The operation of the pilot projects is to be reviewed before the end of the year and based on that review satisfactory models will be progressively extended nationwide by 1994, as resources become available from a growing economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the increase in the number of people unemployed, would the Minister not agree that it is necessary to create extra places on FÁS schemes in the current year?  FÁS are doing quite a good job, despite the magnitude of the problem.  However, there is a need for an injection of more finance into this area to try to cope with the problems.  Many people are trying to get on those courses and they are unable to do so because the allocations are very low.</P>

Why can the Government not take thousands more off the unemployment register and put them doing those jobs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that by late summer we will have about 10,000 extra on social employment schemes.  There will be a question later from Deputy Mitchell about the number involved on training schemes.  I am very cautious about taking people off the dole and putting them on training schemes that are in any way useless.  The money we get from the European Social Fund is for training which, hopefully, will lead to guaranteed employment or a good opportunity for sustainable jobs.  If money was no object we could do what the Deputy suggests. The social employment scheme, which some people say is not that expensive, costs several millions of pounds.  This year the cost of the social employment scheme will be about £70 million.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether the expenditure on pilot projects in local communities is coming from the current budget or if money has been allocated for them?  If it is not coming out of excess budget it amounts to a displacement of jobs in other areas and replacing them with a new initiative.</P>
      <P>In relation to the social employment scheme does the Minister think that with so many people unemployed, 10,500 jobs this year as opposed to 13,000 last year is an indicator of a serious intention to do something about unemployment.</P>

Would the Minister consider making available some advisory method to communities where the uptake as a proportion of the live register is so much lower than elsewhere in the country, through FÁS or whatever mechanism? Would the Minister consider advising communities on the mechanics of establishing a project that qualifies for social employment assistance and could increase the number of workers employed under that scheme?  We all agree that it is lack of knowledge and of infrastructure in some of the newer areas, especially of Dublin, that is the cause of the lower than average uptake of the scheme as compared to parts of the country.</P>

During my last Question Time we spoke about area-based strategy and how that operates in deprived areas and areas where there is high unemployment. While FÁS operate training centres in those areas, we do not have voluntary support from the communities because they have not got the resources. They find it difficult to raise funds.  One community may raise £20,000 and another community very little.  I have been trying to use the area-based strategy to try to push the resources and give a bias towards those communities.  I have <Col N="359" /> done that to the best of my ability.  I have no difficulty about undertaking the advisory aspect.</P>

      <P>The freedom of movement of workers within the European Community is guaranteed under Articles 48 to 51 of the Treaty.  Detailed provisions relating to the exercise of the right of such freedom are contained in Regulation (EEC) No. 1612/68 of the 15 October 1986.</P>
      <P>Under the regulation, any national of a member state has the right to seek and to take up employment in another member state in accordance with the provisions governing the nationals of that state.  The regulation also provides that employers in a member state may not discriminate between one EC national and another on grounds of nationality.</P>
      <P>In effect, this means that an Irish national seeking employment in another member state has the right to compete on the same basis as a national of the host state.  Irish nationals taking up employment with an employer in another EC member state are covered by the legislation of that state and have the same remedies open to them as local people.</P>
      <P>It is essential that anyone contemplating employment abroad obtain in advance a written statement of the wages and conditions attaching to the job in question.  Where employment abroad is obtained through SEDOC, the EC sponsored placement service operated by FÁS, it is possible for FÁS to have complaints investigated should difficulties subsequently arise.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Minister recognises that this question was prompted by a case of 49 workers who were employed in a German plant near Munich through a FÁS advertisement.  Is the Minister aware that some of those workers have described the experience publicly as a horror show and allege they were misled by FÁS concerning the amount of wages, standards of accommodation and lack of washing and cooking facilities, and that the doctors in Germany certified their living accommodation as uninhabitable?  Does the ing facilities, and that the doctors in Germany certified their living accommodation as uninhabitable?  Does the Minister think this is an urgent matter in terms of Community action?  My understanding is that this happens in Germany to migrant workers from outside the Community but I was unaware of the extent of the problem as it affects workers within the Community.  This is a cause for concern and action at Community level.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte said, there was a difficulty with a company called Oldenbourg Limited in Munich.  When that came to their notice it was investigated by FÁS and by the officials of the German department. Through a series of misunderstandings, due to interpretation and language difficulties mainly, the difficulties were compounded. To the best of my knowledge they are resolved, though I have asked for a full report on the current position. I know that on the completion of the contract a number of the workers involved signed a new contract so I assume things are not too difficult.  A few thousand workers find employment under the SEDOC system and FÁS have the right to examine and check individual cases.  They work on the data given to them through SEDOC, a computer based network.  The FÁS equivalent in other member states feed in vacancies on a Community basis, and they all work to the best of their ability.  However, as we <Col N="361" /> know from experience, sometimes they can be misled but we have a right to investigate them.  I would be more concerned about people who are not in the SEDOC system.  That is why the new controls are being brought in.</P>

      <P>When this question was raised previously at Question Time I referred to areas of high disadvantage and explained how the area based strategy was endeavouring to assist people.  I said that priority should be given to areas which have high social deprevation and continual long term unemployment and which have not benefited from the economic boom other areas have experienced. I referred to families in areas of traditional difficulty where perhaps two or three generations of the same family have never had long term sustainable <Col N="365" /> jobs.  I justified the resources in the pilot area based strategy being directed towards such areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in his reply that unemployment is traditional in some areas.  Does he not accept that this could easily have been regarded by some communities as an offensive and insulting statement?  He referred to his area where up to 80 per cent of the adult population are unemployed.  Does he not accept in that context that his remarks could have been seen as offensive to people?  Does he not accept that the opposite is the case and that there is a very strong tradition of manual, unskilled and semi-skilled work associated with Dublin Port and that the advent of containerisation in the port cut off that source of labour?  People are crying out for work in that area; yet successive Governments have failed to provide any alternative employment source other than short term training schemes which do not produce jobs.  Does the Minister not accept that no serious attempt has been made to redress the problem of massive, endemic unemployment in the disadvantaged areas in the centre of Dublin to which he referred?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has the Dáil Official Report in front of him, he would see that a Deputy on the other side of the House asked me if there were areas within the city which I represented which were no-go areas.  I rather hotly said that that was not true and that there were no no-go areas.  I referred to training centres, which have been the recipients of major resources from FÁS.  I would have thought that Deputy Gregory, having been a member of such centres for many years, would have realised the difficulties in the area.  I made the point that these are the areas which most need the resources from the area based strategy. Anyone who read my previous reply would know that it was not in any way offensive to anyone.  As I said, these areas need most support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I used the reference to &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; in my endeavours to explain that some areas <Col N="366" /> have experienced a high rate of unemployment over a very long period. Deputy Gregory referred to the high level of experience and expertise among people who worked in the port area.  This is the very point I was making &mdash; this work has not been sustainable and is not continuous.  This is why areas such as the inner city areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford as well as parts of Tallaght and other parts of the country deserve special attention.  That is the point I was making.</P>

One of the best approaches has been developed in the area-based strategy where the State, the local community &mdash; the people in the area who have knowledge and experience of unemployment problems &mdash; voluntary bodies and employers would work together to create jobs and tackle the problems of deprivation and social difficulties. If that is done in an integrated way it can beat the scourge of unemployment, particularly in inner city areas and in areas where there is a great density of housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>May I specifically ask the Minister if he accepts that the Custom House Docks development was seen as the first sign of real hope of jobs in the north inner city but that in the few years it has been operating, only a derisory handful of jobs have gone to local people from the disadvantaged areas surrounding it, despite all the promises made <Col N="370" /> by the Government when that development was starting off?</P>

      <P>I had hoped to see more jobs being given to local people in the Custom House Docks area but there was a proportion of them given to local people.

      <P>The Minister in his reply to Deputy Gregory referred to the area based schemes and the pilot schemes now in operation.  Does he not agree that these schemes place the onus on the local community?  In many areas where there is no history of industrial activity these communities are deprived and as a result we are asking ordinary working people how to create jobs.  That is precisely what is happening, and yet we are spending millions of pounds.  The idea of putting money into the community is welcome but the Minister is asking people who are already deprived and unemployed how they will solve their own problem.</P>

Given the heavy legislative programme with which my Department are <Col N="371" /> dealing on various fronts and the limited resources available to them, amendment of the Redundancy Payments Acts cannot be regarded as an immediate priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, 15 months after people have been made redundant, and having received a lump sum, if they keep or invest that lump sum for the future, it is used to disqualify them from unemployment assistance and other means tested entitlements? Would the Minister acknowledge that these people are often advised to spend their lump sums quickly?  Would he not agree that some form of amendment to the legislation should be introduced to prevent this happening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that the Deputy is not giving out about the level of the statutory redundancy but rather that people have to spend it in a hurry to get over the means test.  The amendment requested by Deputy Mitchell would be one for the social welfare side.  I am not sure what can be done about the redundancy payments because they are the employees' legal and statutory entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider an amendment exempting those who are prudent with their redundancy lump sums, who invest it for the rainy day or who try to husband it to look after their future needs, so that they will not be penalised after 15 months?  Will he ensure that any redundancy money still in their possession will be disregarded for means test purposes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That change would have to take place in the social welfare legislation on means testing.  From the point of view of the redundancy fund, how it operates and how it assists individuals, I have been trying to ensure that the weekly threshold is kept up to date.  I have no power under the Act to prevent that money from being included in the means test assessment.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that, as Minister for Labour, he is the Minister who proposes redundancy, legislation?  Is he aware that many personnel departments advise employees who have been made redundant to spend this money within 15 months otherwise they will lose out?  There is enormous pressure on these people to buy what they do not want if they are not to lose out.  The Minister for Labour should not try to pass this matter over to the Minister for Social Welfare.  Would he not make some proposal to deal with this outrageous anomaly where those who are prudent are penalised and those who are profligate are rewarded?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to do something in that area because in the last few weeks we have seen people doubling their statutory redundancy figures to kill jobs forever rather than trying to maintain them.  I have taken up that issue several times.  I will look at the laws on means testing as requested by Deputy Mitchell and what is and is not governed by the Social Welfare Acts and take up the issue with my colleague to see whether he can extend the 15 month period.  I will certainly look at that aspect.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking this section is acceptable.  It identifies particular limits in eligibility.  We have had a long drawn out debate and the Minister was about to allay our concerns about eligibility for people with medical cards. Rather than repeat on another section what has been said perhaps the Minister will give a once off reply, and I promise not to interrupt him.  I have not done so up to now and I will not do so now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to clarify the matter once again for Deputy Ferris and other Deputies. In relation to charges for long stay patients, that is patients who are more than 30 days in a hospital, the regulations that allow for that are the Health Charges for In-Patient Services Regulations, 1976.  The regulations have been in place and used by all health boards over the last 15 years.  They have been used in respect of long stay hospitals for the elderly and psychiatric hospitals.  The issue of acute hospitals arose this morning. During the sos I did a quick check around the health boards.  As I understand it, in some health boards where a patient is no longer receiving acute treatment but is being maintained in an acute hospital for longer than 30 days, perhaps waiting for a long stay place, the charges are implemented in the same way as if that patient was more appropriately placed in a long stay institution.</P>
      <P>The case to which Deputy Allen referred relates to a person who was in an acute psychiatric unit.  I accept that such units are treated in the same way as in psychiatric hospitals, but it is only in recent years, with new developments in the service, that acute psychiatric units are being set up in general hospitals.  As Deputy Allen recognises, it has always been the position that a patient in a psychiatric hospital for longer than 30 days pays the charge in the same way as anybody else.  The measure really applies to long stay patients.</P>

I wish to have clarified a point I raised this morning about tourists from Third countries, countries not in the EC. The Minister's guidelines should be such that tourists from Third countries who have an accident while in Ireland should not be denied cover for medical services simply because they come from a Third country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed at length this morning, and the regulations will set out to do what I said they would do.  First, they will ensure that people do not come to use Ireland as a base for services.  Certainly in theory they could do that under the existing legislation. Second, and most important, the regulations will ensure that service will be available to those for whom we would wish to provide it.  I gave the examples of Irish people working on short term <Col N="414" /> projects abroad and of young Irish emigrants who go to the United States, or another country outside the European Community, and come back.  They would be provided for.  The regulations will provide discretion for the chief executive officer of a health board to make decisions with regard to tourists.  Nobody will be denied service because of inability to pay.  That explanation should meet the Deputy's query.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>By issuing guidelines the Minister is taking the decisions from the chief executive officers, so it seems to be a little strange for him to then say that at the end of the day the decisions will be made by chief executive officers rather than under the regulations.  If the Minister issues guidelines then he has the opportunity to tell the chief executive officers that in principle he wants bona fide tourists to be treated with consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>One way that that could be dealt with would be to put down an amendment on Report Stage that would change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The Minister would then have to notify the chief executive officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in all legislation pertaining to the health boards chief executive officers have discretion.  There are many regulations covering the powers of chief executive officers.  One example relates to medical terms.  Chief executive officers have discretion under the law and they have flexibility.  It is important that that flexibility is there to take account of the very point made by Deputy Bruton, that a tourist from outside the European Community who is not eligible for the service and is unable to pay for the service should have account taken of the circumstances and should have service provided. It is important to assure everyone that service will never be denied because of inability to pay.  The issue of a wealthy person who is not eligible but who could pay afterwards could be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

I oppose it in its entirely because it determines that those who have full eligibility or limited eligibility will be deemed not to have full eligibility if they avail of only part of the service.  I cannot accept that provision.  I know that the Minister wants people to decide at the beginning whether they are public or private patients.  Perhaps built into the section is some way to ensure, as the Minister says, that there will be no queue jumping and that people shall not go into hospital as private patients and then decide to become public patients, or <i>vice versa.</i>  However, I register my opposition to this section.</P>

As Deputy Ferris said, it seems that people who go into hospital entirely as public patients but have an individual test or a small element of their care carried out on a private basis would have the rug pulled out from under them and would have the whole session of care deemed to be a private session for which payment would have to be made individually. That would not be a reasonable way to proceed.  People who go into hospital as private patients accept responsibility for all of their consultants' fees and all of their private accommodation. However, it could not be seen to be just and fair to treat people as private patients if just a small element of their care was carried out privately, and that seems to be the way in which the section is drafted at present.  It would be particularly unfair in that those same <Col N="416" /> people would be asked to pay the full health levy on their whole income.  They would feel rightly aggrieved if the Minister applied the kind of ruling that seems to be required under this section.</P>

      <P>Under the new legislation patients will have the right to opt for public or private care.  For the first time in the history of the State everybody will be entitled to opt for public care if that is what is wanted.  At present, while everybody is entitled to a public bed in a public ward, people whose income is more than £16,700 a year have to pay their consultants' fees.  Much of what was said during the Second Stage debate and again this morning identified areas of concern that Deputies had.  For example, Deputies were worried about queue jumping and the use of half public care and half private care &mdash; in other words, people availing of their right to public maintenance and then paying a consultant. It has been suggested, and there is a small amount of evidence to back up those suggestions, that in some cases paying patients were finding their way into public beds ahead of patients who were on the public waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do accept that if patients go to a doctor's consultant rooms as private patients and then discover that it is necessary to be admitted to hospital, they should be able to then decide that it is too expensive for them to go to hospital as private patients.  For example, they may not be in the VHI scheme or they might feel that their VHI did not cover them for their particular treatment. Patients will have the right to opt to be public patients.  However, if people decide to go to hospital as in-patients to private beds they will then be private patients both of the hospital and of the consultants looking after them.  The only exception is the discretion of a chief executive officer in the case of patients wanting to transfer back to being public patients if they discover that the treatment needed is too expensive.  The whole basis of the legislation is to ensure that there is no unfair advantage to private patients over public patients.  The <Col N="417" /> Government want to ensure that public beds are maintained for public patients and that there is no back door way to the hospitals nor any queue jumping in the use of public beds.  That is why the provision is defined clearly, but I do take the point made about people going to consultants on an out-patient basis and then discovering that they have to go to hospital.  It is acceptable in those circumstances that patients should be able to make the choice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the circumstances will be confined to out-patients visiting consultants privately as out-patients before hospitalisation begins.  Unlike the Minister, I am not an expert in medical matters; but it would not be acceptable if a person undergoing public medical treatment decided to go privately for a second opinion and was therefore deemed eligible to pay for everything that went before.  There may be some defects in the drafting where it refers to &ldquo;some part&rdquo;.  In other words any element of the whole episode of care, if taken privately, seems to make the person liable for the whole episode.</P>
      <P>Section 52 of the original Act refers to health boards.  The voluntary hospitals are not health board hospitals.  If the Minister is legislating in this area we should get an opportunity to see what he is providing for in relation to voluntary hospitals.  That will apply all the way through sections 5 and 6 which will apply with equal force to voluntary hospitals and health board hospitals.  Indeed, in the eastern region there are not any Eastern Health Board hospitals to which this would refer.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused by what the Minister has said.  He is now saying that a person who goes to a consultant in his private rooms will be eligible to go into hospital and have public care if he requires medical treatment.  To get an appointment with a consultant in a public hospital one must wait from one to six months.  The Minister knows that. By allowing a person to see a consultant <Col N="418" /> privately and then go into a public hospital for treatment, the Minister is creating a back door into hospital.  The fact that one pays £40 in private rooms to a consultant means that one can immediately go on the waiting list whereas a person waiting for an appointment to see a consultant in a public hospital will have to wait for up to six months.  Will the Minister explain how he can stand over that?</P>

      <P>I do not have any problem with it, because I have taken the trouble to read the 1970 Health Act. Section 54 of that Act made that provision and this Bill is giving recognition to that fact.  Even though a person has the right under the Act to public hospital care there is nothing to stop him from going private in some areas.  That is clear under the Act.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) is not referred to in the 1970 Act but we are inserting it in section 5 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Bruton, a patient will have a choice as to whether to be a public or a private patient.  It is not practical to have a patient opting to be private in one case and public in another.  When patients go into hospital there are many consultants involved, for instance the <Col N="419" /> radiologist, the anaesthetist, the pathologist and so on.  It is important that there be a clear demarcation between public and private patients.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Allen, the length of time for which a patient is on a waiting list is a clinical decision.  The length of time for which a patient must wait to see a consultant in the first instance is a matter for the hospital, the consultant and the GP.  Where somebody is concerned about the length of waiting time, the GP is the best person to contact the hospital or consultant to expedite an appointment.  In relation to a patient going to see a consultant privately, a patient could do so expecting that to be the end of it, but the consultant might need to take a person into hospital for a number of days.  In that case it is only right that the patient be given the right of choice.  I take the point made by Deputy Allen.  If any abuses creep into the system we will deal with them.  I am trying to ensure that public beds are maintained for public patients.  If the system lends itself to abuse we will deal with it.  The House will agree at this stage that where persons go to a private consulting room rather than to a hospital's outpatient department believing the visit to be a once off one, it is only right that they should then be able to have their names placed on the public waiting list if they should then be able to have their names placed on the public waiting list if they have to go into hospital.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of the position of voluntary hospital and health boards, the health boards have always been responsible for eligibility.  The voluntary hospitals only act as an agency on behalf of the health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned that if somebody who has opted to go public needs to have a further test carried out privately, and acts accordingly, he could bar himself from his full entitlement without necessarily being covered by VHI or any other insurance scheme.  We must worry about how every comma and dot are interpreted by hospital administrators, executive officers and others. This specifically says &ldquo;avail of some part <Col N="420" /> of the service&rdquo; which could be interpreted any way.</P>
      <P>There is another problem involved in going to a private clinic for an opinion. This morning I said that there is a waiting list in the south east of 5,000 people for the outpatient's department.  If any of those people went to a consultant privately and if, on clinical examination, the surgeon considered that the patient needed to be admitted to a public or private bed the surgeon would have to give his opinion to the channel through which the patient is admitted to hospital. We are dealing with public patients and their entitlements and they are entitled to be seen in a public hospital.  However, they are still on a waiting list and cannot even cross the first hurdle.  When a GP recommends people to outpatients they are put on a waiting list; the only way to overcome that is to go on a private waiting list and get a diagnosis quickly as to whether there is a need to go to hospital.</P>
      <P>In my constituency a person was entitled to have her eyes tested with a view to surgery.  She was waiting for the best part of two years although she had to be led around the house by her husband. They could not get to the designated eye clinic, there was a waiting list as the consultant was ill so they went privately to an opthalmic specialist who decided, when he saw the patient, that she needed to be operated on straight away.  I can give all the details of that case to the Minister.  I hope that unfortunate wife of an old age pensioner will not be asked to pay the private hospital charges.  She had her eye operation about ten days ago and can now see perfectly but she had the operation as a result of being seen privately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is fatally flawed; we have been talking since the mid-eighties about the abuses under the common contract ageed between the Taoiseach and the consultants in 1979 which was up for review in 1985-86.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had hoped the discussions the Minister had with the IHCA and the IMO in recent times would stamp out some of the terrible abuses in the health services. <Col N="421" /> As I said yesterday, in the Minister's eyeball to eyeball confrontation with the IHCA &mdash; a very powerful group &mdash; in recent times he made a very expensive blink which will cost the taxpayers £36 million.  God only knows what it will cost in the year ahead.  There is a loophole as wide as a barn door in this legislation.  I forecast that because of this section the private rooms of the consultants will be crowded because it will be the back door entrance for hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>I have a letter in which a consultant wrote to a hospital administrator about a three year old child saying that there was a definite deficit in his right let function which warranted an orthopaedic consultant's opinion.  I will not name the patient.  That letter was sent from a consultant in Cork, Professor Cusson, to the administrator of the regional hospital. The reply to the letter from the hospital said that there was a very lengthy waiting list for an appointment to see Mr. McGuinness and that he could expect to be notified of an appointment in approximately 18 months time.</P>
    <P>In that case all the parents have to do is to go to the consultant in his private rooms, the consultant will examine the child within a week of making the appointment and on medical grounds he will be admitted within a short time to the hospital for orthopaedic treatment. However, if the parents cannot afford to go to the consultant's private rooms the child will have to wait.  The Minister is giving a licence to consultants to print money in their consulting rooms.  They can see people privately, diagnose their medical need and put them into hospital; to see the same consultant in a public hospital there would be a wait of at least 18 months.</P>
    <P>The letter to which I referred was dated 11 July 1990; I telephoned the Cork Regional Hospital an hour ago and the child is still waiting for an operation.  It is a scandal for the Minister to tell us that he is creating a just and equitable system; he is trying to cod us.  I will give evidence to the Minister although he received evidence before and nothing was done about it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen has put his finger on what seems to be a major weakness in the Minister's arguments.  It is common knowledge that people who go privately to an out-patients will get attention well ahead of someone who joins the public queue.  The Minister said that there can be barrages of letters to try to accelerate the process but any GP will tell him that it is a very frustrating experience which does not result in people who should be treated being seen urgently.  We may be putting a system in place which will be riddled with anomalies and that goes back to the fundamental flaw of the common waiting list being abandoned.  I would ask the Minister to explain the way the system will be policed to ensure that it is fair.</P>

What <Col N="425" /> Deputy Bruton suggested is not practicable. Indeed, he is now objecting to what he himself suggested earlier, which was that a person while in hospital should be able to go from public to private.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendments No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 33 to 35 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Except in the case of an emergency, nothing in this Act shall permit the Minister, or Health Boards, or others to redesignate public beds in public hospitals as private beds.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment will test the Minister's commitment to ensure that public beds will always be available for public patients in public hospitals and that the provisions of this Bill which will extend full eligibility to every person in the country will not interfere with the rights of those who are waiting for a bed.  During my Second Stage contribution I suggested that one of the ways the money lost to consultants and hospitals from the VHI could be made up would be for the Minister, his <Col N="426" /> officials or the health boards to redesignate public beds which may have been closed as private beds in public hospitals. If this were to happen the number of beds available for public patients would be reduced.  I ask the Minister to state categorically if it is his intention to do this. If public beds are redesignated as private beds in public hospitals, then the people I represent will be placed at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I have included the words &ldquo;except in the case of an emergency&rdquo; because in the event of a tragic accident, beds must be made available.  The amendment reads:</P>
    <P>Except in the case of an emergency, nothing in this Act shall permit the Minister, or health boards or others to redesignate public beds in public hospitals as private beds. </P>
    <P>The Minister indicated on Second Stage that this probably will happen.  I do not object to the idea that there should be some private beds in public hospitals. Indeed it is appropriate that there should always be two or three private beds in a public hospital &mdash; that is true in the case of St. Joseph's  Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel &mdash; because there are those who will wish to go private in their local hospital as they have a good relationship with their consultant. However, I do not want to see a large number of beds being redesignated as private beds because if this were to be done those entitled to a public bed would be placed at a disadvantage.  Again, the Minister should be honest with the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has insisted throughout this debate that public patients will not lose out.  At the same time he has not outlined the present complement of public beds and private beds.  He has insisted that public beds will be available for public patients but he has not said at any stage that there are X number of public beds available and that he is going to insist that this number be preserved.  He has mentioned that the total complement of beds will be preserved. In the interest of guaranteeing <Col N="427" /> equity in the service, the public would like to see a certain number of beds being preserved and the Minister giving an assurance that this number will not be reduced.  I fear that in the scramble public beds will go astray.  The health boards may lose revenue and under that pressure, there may be an effort made to redesignate beds as private beds as a means of raising revenue in the face of tight budgets.  There is a very serious issue at stake.  People want to be reassured that the Minister knows exactly what he is talking about and that he can give a cast iron guarantee that the number of public beds will not be encroached upon.  I hope he is in a position to do that because I feel there is a high degree of vagueness in the Department as to where the public beds are and who uses them.  The Minister has always made great play of private patients coming in and using public beds, the Minister's point about queue jumping was that private patients were using public beds and this was the point he was trying to deal with.  However, at the same time the Minister has never been able to answer questions on the extent of that practice.  We are supposed to be making well thought out changes in health policy but we do not have the facts unpinning it.  I hope we will get some worth while new information on the precise bed complement that will be guaranteed to public patients and that there will be a guarantee that there will be no erosion of that number under the pressures of budgets which might tempt hospital authorities to redesignate beds as private beds so that they could earn revenue from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that I had made allegations which he hoped would I stand over.  In reply I said I did not <Col N="428" /> make any allegations but I that I was stating the facts as outlined in a report compiled over two years ago by the Southern Health Board which defined the level of private practice in public hospitals in that health board area.  The first thing the Minister should have done before introducing this Bill was to define the level of private practice in our public hospitals throughout the country but by his own admission he did not do that. Second, and I can only speak from my experience as a member of the health board in my own area, at our last meeting neither the management nor any of the members could say definitely how we were going to designate the beds, as private or public beds.  This scheme is due to take effect next Saturday but, despite being a health board member, I am totally in the dark as to how this is going to be managed.  Even though the Minister is assuring us that the number of public beds will not be affected, the number of public beds is still being reduced and the most recent example &mdash; which I tried to raise on the Adjournment this evening &mdash; is the possibility that 40 beds will close in the Mercy Hospital, Cork for the summer months because of the inadequate allocation.  This will take another 40 beds out of the system which is taxed to the point of over loading at present. Beds are still being taken out of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may not be suspicious by nature but in this case I am suspicious that some of the beds which were taken out of the system in recent months and years will be brought back into the system and designated as private beds.  I believe the whole campaign of closing off wards was done so that the Minister could re-introduce them and designate them as private beds.  I bet that is going to be done so that the wards that have been closed down will be re-opened and the beds will be designated as private beds.  I would like the Minister to assure us that that will not happen.  The beds which are presently being taken out of the system must not be redesignated as private beds.  No matter what happens it is a simple algebraic problem, if you have X number of beds <Col N="429" /> in the system and Y number of beds are designated as private beds you are left with X-Y.  What is the third variable in the equation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to substitute section 6 for section 55 of the 1970 Act.  This section refers to entitlements established under section 52.  Am I right in saying that it is clearly defined in section 52 that a person may either have full eligibility or limited eligibility and provision is being made for persons who may appear on the scene from another European country who do not immediately appear to be able to establish that they are either in category 1 or category 2 and that this section makes provision for such cases.  Section 55 of the 1970 Act states:</P>
      <P>A health board may make available in-patient services for persons who do not establish entitlement to such services under section 52 and (in private or semi-private accommodation) for persons who establish such entitlement but do not avail themselves of the services under that section and the board shall charge for any services so provided charges approved of or directed by the Minister. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a provision exists already.  I feel that perhaps that section gave more power to the health board or to the consultant to have private beds in public hospitals.  I understand this will be limited and it will be very interesting to see how many of the 64 beds in my local hospital will be used for private practice.  Let me tell you that I am aware of the fact that it is very hard to get the information as to how many are being used for private practice but I can see this being sorted out under this legislation unless, as Deputy Allen says, there is something we cannot see beneath the surface, and that we could find that the beds are designated as private beds in a subtle move to get more money for the health board.  However, I do not see it that way.  I see this as good legislation in so far as it will identify quite clearly and draw a distinction between <Col N="430" /> public and private beds as it is impossible at present to make that distinction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a few points on this section.  Over the past number of years despite the closure of a number of beds there has never been a shortage of beds for private patients and I fear that in the climate of financial restraint and cutbacks for voluntary and health board hospitals there will be a likelihood that a designation of beds for private patients will be used as a revenue raising process to make up for the shortfall in finance from the Department.  That trend is very evident in many of the voluntary hospitals.  I think it is wrong of the Minister not to give some indication to the health boards as to the ratio of public to private beds.  I know this will vary from health board area to health board area because of the potential patient profile, including the age profile, which varies greatly from area to area and the percentage of population who have health insurance as opposed to those who will be relying on public beds.  There is an onus on the Minister to provide some indication and some baseline, which he thinks fit, beyond which the health boards and hospital management should not go in terms of identifying the number of beds for private and public patients.  Otherwise this vehicle will be used by health boards in financial difficulties to make up for the shortfalls in the allocation of money from the Minister.  I would like the Minister to give some indication this evening as to what he thinks the breakdown between public and private patients should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want some assistance from the Minister on the question of health boards carrying out a profile of patients in their respective areas because it varies greatly from one health board to another.  One of the great difficulties of health boards planning any service for their area is that few, if any, of them have carried out or have any record of patient profile in their area.  Attempting to provide a service to the public without having the basic information is impossible.  The Minister must state today a base line beyond which <Col N="431" /> health boards and voluntary hospitals cannot go in terms of demarcation between public and private beds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 28 and 29, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;(1) Section 3 of this Act shall come into operation immediately.</P>
      <P>(2)  All other sections of this Act shall come into operation on such day as the Minister by order appoints and such day shall not be earlier than 1st July, 1992.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we spent a lot of time arguing that the Bill before us is not just a Bill to abolish the rod licence, which proposal is contained in section 3, but that it is also a Bill which proposes to bring in by the backdoor another charge for fishing through the establishment of so-called fishery co-operatives, enabling those co-operatives to charge a share certificate for people who want to fish and on top of that, enabling them to make rules which would exclude individual citizens who have not purchased a share certificate from fishing our rivers and lakes.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage my colleagues and I argued that the Bill should end at section 3 and pleaded with the Minister to withdraw the rest of it until such time as further consideration had been given to it.  However, he declined to do this.  We then went through each section, teased them and pointed out that since the average citizen would have to pay for the privilege of fishing in our rivers and lakes, the principle about which we had the rod licence dispute would not be resolved in this Bill as people would still have to pay to fish.  We lost that battle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> I am attempting to do two things in my amendment.  As it stands at present, the Bill will come into operation on such day as the Minister, by order, appoints.  There are two very distinct sets of provisions in the Bill, one of which is contained in section 3 which proposes to abolish the rod licence.  My amendment provides that section 3 shall come into operation immediately.  This would be desirable as we now have to deal with a very ambiguous situation where the 1987 Act is still in force, where, theoretically, fishery officers are required under that Act to implement it and somebody going out to fish is required to hold a rod licence, but, in practice, the Minister has made some kind of a nod and wink arrangement with the fishing community and fishery boards to the effect that they should ignore the 1987 Act and not insist on people holding rod licences.  That is undermining the status of legislation which is passed by this House and the enforcement of law generally.  It is not desirable that a situation should be prolonged whereby in theory you are required to hold a rod licence but in practice you do not need to have it, so let us bring section 3 of the legislation into effect immediately.</P>
    <P>The establishment of fishery co-operatives by their very nature will take some time.  The Minister will have to draw up draft rules for them and he will have to make the order which will bring the so-called fishery co-operatives into being. They will then have to be formed, elections held and that inevitably will take a certain amount of time.  A certain period should elapse before the fishery co-operatives come into effect because there is a need for some further reflection on what kind of rules they will have.  On Committee Stage the Minister gave an indication that at this stage we might have received copies of the draft rules he was proposing for the fishery co-operatives. To date we have not received them.  It is desirable therefore that a period should elapse before these bodies are brought into being so that everybody knows where they stand.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes that the <Col N="442" /> remainder of the Act which deals essentially with the co-operatives be brought into effect not earlier than 1 July 1992; in other words I am talking about a period of 12 months.  That is not unreasonable. In practice it will take that length before these bodies are up and running and the time could very usefully be used in preparing the groundwork for them.  Essentially, I am making two proposals in the amendment: first, the immediate abolition of the rod licence in order that people can go out once this Bill is passed and signed to fish without a rod licence; and, second, that a period should elapse which could usefully be used in preparation for the setting up of these bodies. I am suggesting a breathing space of about one year.  That is a very reasonable proposition, which I ask the Minister to accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an eminently sensible amendment and as a legislator the Minister might appreciate, in so far as Deputy Gilmore has pointed out that section 3 would come into operation immediately.  As legislators we have expressed our concern here about the no man's land or limbo in which people find themselves at present regarding their right to fish, and whether the licences are operable.  In that clear still light &mdash; which I know is not good for fishing &mdash; the Minister would then have the time and the opportunity to bring in the rules and regulations and to allow the shareholders and the fishery co-operatives to be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note from the debate on Committee Stage that the Minister said he would do his best to have draft rules and regulations circulated before Report Stage because they are fundamental to the concerns of everybody in the House regarding the setting up of the co-operatives and the way in which they will be run and established.  As noted by Deputy Gilmore the Minister does not seem to have been able to produce those draft rules and regulations as of now.  The Minister and his Department must ensure that they are devised and developed in the best possible way without pressure within <Col N="443" /> that time limit.  It would also enable the Minister and his Department to have full information and knowledge available to the angling clubs to sort out all the difficulties and differences we tried to tease out on Committee Stage.  Above all, the setting up and registering of these co-operatives and the development of the shareholdings will take time.</P>
    <P>Now that the deadline of 30 April which I had put down in my previous amendment to include this year's May Fly fishing has passed and we are into the tourist and angling season which we all worry about with regard to giving freedoms and rights to anglers for this year, the amendment, if accepted, would allow the Minister an opportunity to bring in the rules and regulations and have them discussed here before he gives them to the co-operatives and the interested groups outside.  It would be an acknowledgement of the concern and interest expressed on this Bill both inside and outside this House.  I would commend the Minister for giving himself and ourselves that breathing space.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this important amendment.  It complements a previous amendment I had put down on Committee Stage.  The present situation is financial.  People are out fishing with no licences, for whatever reason, because the Minister has turned a blind eye to the rod licence issue.  It is no longer relevant. In fairness to everyone a law that is no longer relevant should be repealed immediately.  The amendment seeks to deal with the Gilbertian situation: laws exist, nobody abides by the law, everyone is out fishing and there are contests all over the country and no one seems to care anymore about rod licences.  The sooner we get this matter rectified the better for everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incredible that since 17 December 1987 we have been fooling around with this bad legislation because that is what it was the first day.  We were told that in this House.  We voted against it but it was brought in and we knew it would never be activated.  No one seems to know the <Col N="444" /> correct situation.  People are asking whether they should have a rod licence; strictly speaking the answer is yes but the reality is that it is not necessary.  Every day of the week people pass by my house with their rods going off fishing.  It is a great joke with them because they say: &ldquo;Gerry, what are you doing up there wasting your time?&rdquo;  At the start we tried to bring this into line with the present position by getting rid of the rest of the Bill and getting us back to where we were in 1987 by saying this is what we want, this is the situation that has caused all the problems, without going into details on the co-operatives.  I am aware the Minister did not give us any leeway whatsoever. He put the boot in on a few occasions and said he was adamant that it was going through.  I still have grave reservations about the legislation governing the rod licence.  If this amendment were accepted and implemented immediately we would have redeemed ourselves somewhat in the eyes of the public.  Even through I would still have reservations at least it would show that this House has some control over the matter.  At present fishery board officers do not know what to do.  They do not know whether or not to implement the law.  The Minister should consider the amendment very carefully.  If it is accepted this House will be seen to be doing something about the present position.  We discuss this issue month after month knowing that the position outside is farcical.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in supporting this amendment.  We are at the height of the fishing season and in every pub in the country angling contests are advertised. The position in regard to licences is a standing joke and this House is being brought into disrepute.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment and then we can consider the rest of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to face up to the position which now prevails, through no fault of his.  For the past year it has been the law that a person who wants to fish should have a rod licence but the Minister announced one year ago that the rod licence was to be <Col N="445" /> abolished.  We are now in the final stages of abolishing that licence officially and setting up co-operatives.  When this Bill becomes law we will not immediately be able to replace the rod licence with co-operatives. Let us not continue with the farce that has gone on for three years.  I often heard of a three act comedy but this has been a three year farce.  A year ago we were told we could not abolish the rod licence because amending legislation would not be introduced but today we are discussing the final Stages of amending legislation.  As a citizen I believe there should be no rod licence.  We are legislating here to replace the rod licence with another system.  We should not carry the farce any further.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we are introducing co-operatives in place of the rod licence, and anglers can pay their contribution through the co-operatives.  While we are awaiting the setting up of the co-operatives the rod licence should be abolished by this legislation so that the farce will not continue.  As Deputy O'Sullivan and people like myself who come from an angling area will know, there are many anglers on the lakes at present.  Headford and Oughterard are full of anglers anxious to fish.  The law is an ass in that these people are fishing without licences even though the law states that they must have a licence to fish.  None of us wants to see this position continuing and, therefore, we should adopt this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking back at the debate on this provision on Committee Stage none of us got it right.  As Deputy Gilmore said, there are two entirely different matters being dealt with under this Bill: one is the abolition of the rod licence and the other is the introduction of the so-called co-operatives.  Much of the debate on Committee Stage was misguided because we were talking about two entirely different matters and trying to set the most suitable date for them. This amendment offers a solution to the problem.  The Minister will agree we should get rid of the rod licence immediately so that the anglers will know where they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> One could argue about the best date for the implementation of the other provisions of the Bill.  Deputy Gilmore, in his amendment, suggested 1 July 1992 and I accept that.  It could be 1 June 1992 or 1 August 1992; nobody will argue about that.  The Deputy is trying to establish a very important principle, that the co-operatives will not be up and running for some time.  I suspect that if the Minister does not accept this amendment we will have to consider what is in section 2. That section simply states that the Act will come into operation on such a date as the Minister by order appoints.  It will be some months before the Minister so appoints because he is not addressing this matter in the right way.  He is trying to deal with two entirely different matters. I will be interested to hear his reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that it is essential that the rod licence be substituted by the co-operatives, that the rod licence be abolished at the same time as the setting up of the co-operatives, but that is not a good argument.  Let us abolish the rod licence now once and for all and if we need these wretched co-operatives, as the Minister suggests we do, let us bring them in on 1 July next year or some other suitable date some time from now.</P>

      <P>The Bill, and this section as an integral part of it, is a cohesive whole.  I worked out a set of proposals punctiliously, and fine-tuned them as part of a package. I promised this House, and the various interests, that this legislation would be on the Statute Book and the co-operatives would be in action at an early date, and I have committed myself to that.  Deputy Gilmore referred to a nod and wink, but I reject his suggestion.  I was going to say I resent it but that is not a very productive emotion.  I would like the House to know that I seldom nod and for many years I have been economical with the wink.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has an earlier date in mind I would be happy to agree to it if that is what is required. There are two issues involved in this amendment, the first being the question of the immediate abolition of the rod licence.  The Minister in his reply gave no indication as to when he proposes to bring the Act into operation.  It is most desirable that the section of the Bill dealing with the abolition of the rod licence is brought into effect immediately.  As Deputy McCormack said, the position has prevailed for three years whereby the legislation states that people going out to fish are supposed to have a rod licence, but in practice they do not have one, and nothing has been done about it.  The House is now passing legislation that, among other things, abolishes rod licences.  That should be put in place immediately so that people fishing this season will be put on side &mdash; in practice they do not have a rod licence and nobody expects them to have one, nor does the law expect them to have one.  That is what I am trying to achieve in the first part of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his reply the Minister said the Bill comes as a cohesive whole, that it is a package.  I know it was negotiated as a package but in practice it cannot be implemented as a package because it will <Col N="448" /> take some time to establish the co-operatives. Realistically, I do not see them being established inside a year, but I am open to persuasion on that point.</P>
    <P>It is not desirable to leave the abolition of rod licences until such time as the co-operatives are established unless, as I suspected at the very beginning, the Bill is not about the abolition of rod licences but is simply about replacing them, and the Minister in wanting to keep the legislation as a cohesive whole does not want to put an interval between the legislative abolition of the rod licences and the introduction of the payment of share certificates because he simply wants to replace one form of payment with another.  I suspect that the Minister is afraid that if he does abolish rod licences by the passage of this Bill and allows time to elapse before the establishment of the so-called co-operatives and people are asked to pay for share certificates, the concept may never get off the ground and his whole purpose in the Bill, which is to replace rod licences with some other form of payment, will be thwarted.  I suspect that is the reason the Minister is opposed to this amendment.</P>
    <P>I intend to put the amendment to the House.  Quite honestly &mdash; and I ask the Minister to reflect on this &mdash; it would be highly unusual for the Government to vote against a proposal to repeal immediately legislation that has not been working for some time and that is honoured more in the breach than in the observance, which has the blessing of all concerned. It is not desirable to have legislation on the Statute Book that is not observed, that everybody knows is not being observed, that nobody is doing anything about and that nobody wants to do anything about.  The Bill repeals that legislation on the one hand and introduces something else on the other hand. The repeal should take place immediately. I am disappointed the Minister has not responded more positively.  If his problem is with the date in the amendment, then I am quite happy to change to whatever the Minister thinks reasonable.</P>

      <P>We will now move on to amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Garland.  Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are related so they can be taken together for the purposes of debate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 14 to 16.</P>
      <P>This amendment is identical to amendment No. 14 which I moved on Committee Stage. Unfortunately the Minister has not responded.  I dealt with this matter fairly adequately on Committee Stage but I will repeat what it is about.  It is about removing the requirement under section 5 (1) of the Bill under which the Minister may:</P>
      <P>make rules for the regulation of societies and such rules shall constitute the rules of each society from its establishment. </P>
      <P>We had quite a lengthy debate on this on Committee Stage and everyone on this side of the House was very unhappy with the concept of the Minister imposing rules on the society and, furthermore, that these rules were not contained in the Bill.  Nobody at this stage knows the content of these rules, it is a very important point and I appeal to the Minister to give the matter further consideration even at this late stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 in my name deals with the same subject.  On Committee Stage debate the Minister indicated that he would make the draft rules for the society available to us but, so far, we have not received them.  Basically, we are being asked to allow the Minister to establish, by order, certain bodies who will have very far reaching powers in relation to fishery matters. They will have power to decide who fishes the rivers and lakes, to impose charges by way of share certificates and even to identify people to be prosecuted. Remarkable powers are being given to them and we do not even know the rules of the society.  We do not know their composition, how their meetings will be conducted, what a quorum will be, how ballots will be conducted and how democratic these bodies will be because we have not seen the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> I had hoped that we would have been given a glimpse of the draft rules before this late stage but that has not happened. My amendment is that the rules should be published at least six months before any order is made to establish a fishery co-operative society.  That is reasonable as it would give the people who will set up the society an opportunity to see what is in store for them and enable prospective members of the fishery co-operative society to know how the society will be governed.</P>
    <P>It would be preferable if these rules were brought forward before the legislation is enacted but, unless the Minister proposes to give us a copy of them across the Floor of the House, we will not see them.  It is intolerable that we are being asked to legislate for something, the detailed governing of which we do not yet know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>This was one of the areas of most concern to all Members and I am sure the Minister will recall that the reason for the amendments put forward by Fine Gael was that at least we would be building on structures where rules, regulations and expertise were already in place.  We felt that even if they needed change or amending, we were building on a familiar foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with my colleagues that we have a special responsibility in this House. When we are introducing legislation, the implications of which are so far reaching and will have such an effect on a major resource &mdash; one of the most important natural resources in the country &mdash; as legislators we must consistently say to the Minister that it would be irresponsible if we did not make the point about the rules and regulations which, he said, he would try to have for Report Stage.  We need to know how far reaching and powerful those rules and regulations will be, not just in regard to including people in the co-operatives but also with a view to excluding people.  It would be an acknowledgement of the importance of this legislation &mdash; and indeed a commitment by the Minister to the concerns, interests and contributions from this side. <Col N="454" /> of the House &mdash; if we could see the rules and regulations of the society before we pass this legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland &mdash; because he did not get satisfaction up to now &mdash; attempted to cope with this by deleting the section, thus removing the lack of knowledge and ignorance about the powers and the rules. When taken in concert with Deputy Gilmore's amendment and the underlying motivation of both, it is obvious that not alone should legislators behave responsibly and realise what they are legislating for, but that the rules should be published and discussed before the final structures are made.  Again and again people dealing with amendments, rules and regulations on a day to day basis can, for very practical reasons, point out loopholes and implications of which we as legislators may not be totally aware.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider the two amendments in relation to this issue in deference to the expertise of people outside, from the administrative level to the pursuit of angling, so that we can enact the very best legislation and rules and regulations to underprint it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we do not debate all aspects of the rod licence legislation we will get nowhere.  Some of the most controversial provisions in the Bill are the rules governing the co-operative movement and the society.  We should have learned from the past but we are debating the final stages of this Bill &mdash; we will soon be asked to vote it into law &mdash; and we still do not know the rules governing the societies.  It would be daft to go down the same road we took in 1987.  I have not doubt that the Minister consulted officials in his Department who have the expertise to put in place rules and regulations governing any matter, but we must remember that in the 1987 legislation certain regulations were also put forward.  We all know what happened to them because the anglers would not accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not too much to ask that the Minister should give the House, the angling groups or the elected representatives, at <Col N="455" /> least some idea of what the regulations will be.  The Minister pointed out on Committee Stage certain aspects of the regulations but that is not good enough. People want to be given the opportunity to study the rules and perhaps make suggestions to the Minister.  It is even possible that their ideas may be better. Indeed, some of the angling groups have asked me if they will be given a copy of the rules before the Bill is passed, as they were quite entitled to do given that they are deeply involved in this matter. Bureaucracy is being forced on them once again.  We should avoid doing this at all costs.  I am sure that the angling clubs, the Department and the Minister who has been given the responsibility to clear up the mess caused by the rod licence dispute realise that we may find ourselves in serious difficulty if the rules and regulations laid down are not acceptable. It has to be said that the Members of this assembly are being asked to agree to the Bill even though they do not know what the rules will be or the problems that will arise.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion we discussed this matter the Minister indicated that he would be prepared to issue a copy of the draft rules as soon as he was in a position to do so but that is not the answer.  We are being asked to agree to the Bill even though we will have no input into the rules and are not in a position to discuss them as we do not know what they will be.  Perhaps some groups are aware of what they will be.  The Minister may inform us later that he has shown a copy of the draft rules to some groups and that they are quite happy with them but they are not being asked to vote on the legislation. We will have to vote on it and we are supposed to know what we are voting on.  I am of the view that before the rules are finalised a copy of the draft rules should be presented to those who have an interest in this matter, the angling clubs and the Members of this House who have a responsibility to resolve this major problem.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most controversial aspects of the legislation.  Indeed, the <Col N="456" /> Minister was not very convincing on the last occasion we discussed this matter but he did indicate that he would be prepared to bring before the House a copy of the draft rules before they were passed into law.  Unfortunately, we are going to vote on the Bill without knowing what the rules are going to be.  This is sad given that there is goodwill on all sides of the House &mdash; even though the Minister has not accepted any amendment &mdash; that we should resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>The last thing we want to see is another dispute of the magnitude of the rod licence dispute which proved very damaging. I would ask the Minister therefore to consider what Deputy Gilmore has suggested which has that the rules be published at least six months before any order is made to give people an opportunity to study them and to say that they would like to be associated with them or would like to see them amended.  If necessary, we should be given the opportunity to come back into the House to amend them.  I am quite sure we would be willing to do so.  The Minister is wrong in asking us to agree to the Bill as it stands.  I need to know in what direction we are headed.  Unless we know this we could face another major problem and bad legislation could be replaced with something far worse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendments because I do not want to vitiate the structure of the Bill.  I indicated on Committee Stage and I think on Second Stage also that what we are dealing with here is a number of voluntary societies &mdash; there is no question of compulsion &mdash; who are coming together to do what they told me they would do and want to do, that is, to make a contribution to the development of inland fisheries.  Another motivation was the need to get the Bill through as quickly as possible.  Given that the Opposition have just come from the lobby having voted in favour of the starting date of July 1992 and a short time ago pressed me to accept a date in April 1991, I find it very difficult to assess the thinking &mdash; I would not be so uncharitable as to think <Col N="457" /> that it was opposition for the sake of opposition &mdash; behind the big drive to have it commence in April 1991 and the move all of a sudden to go through the lobby in favour of a date in July 1992.</P>

      <P>I suppose the seasons change and views can change with them. As I said, the societies are voluntary and open to anyone who wants to participate in the development of inland fisheries. The procedural rules have been put together for the benefit of those societies. The fishing interests will be consulted and suggestions will be accepted and considered. What I find most strange is the contention that we have not revealed anything about the rules even though section 5 on page 3 of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage suggestions had been made by speakers on the opposite side and it was on foot of the promise that I made following my acceptance of their suggestions that I tabled this amendment.

      <P>In page 4, lines 5 and 6, to delete &ldquo;such fee as may be specified by the Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a fee&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This deals with a relatively minor point. I had raised it on Committee Stage but unfortunately the Minister did not respond to it.  The Bill provides that the rules may be obtained on the payment of a fee as may be specified by the Minister. I made the point on Committee Stage, in the hope that the Minister would take it on board, that this was an unwarranted interference by the Minister in what was a very trivial matter and that it could be left to the good sense of the clubs not to fix an exorbitant fee like £10,000 or even £10.  This is just bureaucracy gone mad and I had hoped that the Minister would have taken a simple amendment like this on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) Each society shall maintain a register of members which shall be available for inspection by members.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises out of an amendment which was moved by Deputy Garland on Committee Stage, to the effect that any person shall be entitled to a list of shareholders of the society on payment <Col N="461" /> to the society of a fee.  In the course of that debate it was argued that this would be desirable because of possible controversies that might arise over decisions that would be made.  For example, if the societies decide by a 60 per cent majority vote, which they would be entitled to do, that everybody has to hold a share certificate and that an individual who wants to go fishing on a Sunday cannot do so free of charge but has to pay for it, this could give rise to a certain amount of difficulty as to who is a member of the society.  We may well find that in a number of years somebody who will be aggrieved at a decision made by a society will say: &ldquo;That crowd are only a clique and who do they represent anyway?&rdquo;  It would be desirable therefore that there should be a register setting out who the members are.  The Minister in his reply stated &ldquo;it is envisaged that there will be a register of members which will be available for inspection by members&rdquo;.  As you can see, therefore my amendment takes word for word what the Minister said on Committee Stage he envisaged would be the situation and I do not think there are any grounds for the Minister to oppose this amendment.  If he envisages it happening it should be in the Bill, otherwise it will not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. Deputy Gilmore has put the reason very eloquently that it seems a basic right that the register should be available for inspection.  It is a very simple matter and, like Deputy Gilmore, I hope the Minister will take this very simple, straightforward idea on board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical but very important amendment.  It allows the members of a society to check on who are the registered members of a society. The Minister may say that it is not necessary to put this in.  The mere fact that it is in the Bill will give the right to members to inspect the register should a dispute arise at any time in the future.  In cases where there is a dispute as to who is or is not a member, the register is the ideal <Col N="462" /> way to solve it.  If we are setting up co-operatives it is only right that we would follow the normal practice of any association, club or other body of having a book of registered members at any time they feel be open to members at any time they feel like checking it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister reply in the affirmative, particularly in view of the fact that, as Deputy Gilmore has pointed out, the Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he believed this would be part of the democratic working of such co-operatives. Voting rights have serious implications, particularly voting rights that may give more influence to one group over another.  There has to be a register to ensure that that type of voting is carried out to the satisfaction of everybody, particularly as we have built into this Bill a 60 per cent majority vote that can include or, even more disastrously, exclude.  There must be no possibility of élitism.  I know the Minister is a great believer in democracy and he must ensure that not alone is the register there but kept in order.  If he does not do that, as we know from experience, registers might go missing or will not be filled up or there will be pages missing or whatever.  I do not wish to sew into the record of this House the kind of mismanagement or misinterpretation there can be when voting rights are in question, but we all know about them.  This would ensure that there would be no such attempt.</P>

I agree with Deputy Barnes that where there is voting one must be sure of the register, know who is entitled to vote, etc.  What I have outlined is the ordinary co-operative procedure.  The only reason I am not accepting this amendment to the Bill is that it is pleonastic here in this section.  It is covered by the rules of procedure of co-operatives.</P>

      <P>I would hate to have to start arguing the Minister's latter point. I take it from what the Minister is saying that this provision will be in the rules of the societies that he intends to give the societies.  If that is the case then I will be happy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 19 and 20, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The management committee may co-opt persons to fill vacancies amongst its members, the co-option to be confined to the next person in line per previous ballot.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is identical to my amendment No. 25 on Committee Stage.  The Minister did amend section (4) on Committee Stage but it is still not satisfactory.  As it stands subsection (4), as amended by the Minister, states that vacancies among elected members shall be filled in accordance with the rules of the society.  We are back <Col N="464" /> to this problem again.  I would be quite happy with that amendment but for the fact that the rules of the society are and can be and probably will be imposed by the Minister.  It becomes necessary for us here in the House to try to take some of these powers from the Minister and put a specific provision in the Bill which will cater for co-option, which I am sure will be quite a common matter.  Over the course of a year one finds that a couple of people retire or, occasionally, die and it is a very real problem.</P>
    <P>My amendment will provide that the management committee may co-opt persons to fill vacancies among its members, the co-option to be confined to the next person in line as per the previous ballot. It may be that that rule will go into the rules of the societies.  We do not know. If it does, so much the better.  Perhaps the Minister will give us another little peep into the draft rules of the societies which he has up his sleeve.  This is an important point of principle; it is a point of democracy.  I have not seen this one before but I think it is an excellent provision that when management committees are being appointed, and 12 people are to be on the management committee, we should elect 16 or 18, the first 12, to serve initially and, as and when members drop out for one reason or another, they are replaced in the order in which they were elected.  There is nothing more democratic than that.  It is a simple amendment and surely the Minister can accede to that.</P>

      <P>It is a reasonable amendment taking into consideration that a ballot would have taken place in any case.  It would also prevent any abuse of the system.  We are shooting in the dark here again because we do not know what the rules governing such an occasion will be if such an occasion should arise. It goes back to what the Minister said a while ago when he outlined the rules governing societies.  The Minister read out not rules but a list of headings.  I am sorry to come back to this but I must get it straight because Deputy Garland's amendment hinges on it.  What Deputy <Col N="465" /> Garland is trying to do is to copperfasten one aspect of the society where a gap may appear so that the next person in line would automatically be elected.  It is a reasonable request but again, because we do not know exactly what is in the rules to govern such a situation, we are left in limbo.  This is my only chance to have some input into the rules to be drawn up in the near future.  I support the amendment because at least I will have some say in governing the aspect of bringing someone to the society.  Unfortunately it is the only chance I have to do so.</P>

      <P>We had a fairly long, pingpong discussion on this on Committee Stage and I indicated, and it is on the record of the House, that I intended that the rule would provide for the situation envisaged by Deputy Garland.  However, the wording of Deputy Garland's amendment is not satisfactory.  It provides that: &ldquo;The management committee may co-opt persons to fill vacancies amongst its members, the co-option to be confined to the next person in line per previous ballot.&rdquo;  It is just a little simplistic and does not cover all the eventualities, but the rules will provide precisely for the next person on the previous ballot to fill a vacancy.  As well as that the rules will cover the eventuality, quite a common one, where there is not a next person, where there is nobody available, so the management committee will have power to co-opt.</P>

      <P>The Minister may well be correct in saying my amendment is slightly flawed, but this is the whole purpose of the way we do business in the House.  This amendment was put forward on Committee Stage.  I do not have resources through a parliamentary drafts-person, and for the Minister to say he has some sympathy with the amendment makes the whole point.  He should have brought in his own amendment on Report Stage to tidy up what he regards as inadequacies in my amendment, but he has not done so.  Again he is quoting from these draft rules.  That is unsatisfactory and I wish to press my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 37 to 44, and in page 5, to delete lines 1 to 5. </P>
      <P>I will not hold up the House for too long towards the end of this Report Stage.  We all spent a good deal of time and perhaps even passion on this section of the Bill. I decided to put down this amendment because of fears we still share.  It may seem a very fundamental, even crude, way to deal with it but it is to draw attention to the anxieties we feel regarding this section.  I acknowledge that the Minister in his response to us here this evening at various stages agrees with us when we talked about democracy, the importance of voting rights and the desirability of openness of voting registration. However, this section which my amendment proposes to delete builds in something that could be seen as antidemocratic and at its worst discriminatory, because it does not give one person one vote as is usually understood in democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section is loaded on behalf of corporate membership.  It provides that the corporate member shall be entitled to nominate without fee one other member of the society.  Again and again we urged the Minister to remember the implications of this.  Section 8 (3) compounds the fear we have of that type of loading or even privilege in that it provides that: &ldquo;In considering whether to grant recognition to an angling club or other body for the purpose of subsection (1) of this section or fixing the amount of a fee to <Col N="467" /> be paid by a corporate member under that subsection particular regard shall be had to the outlay of the body concerned on fisheries development work of public benefit in the area in which the society operates.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will not labour the point, but this section as now worded leaves the way open to providing privilege for people, particularly corporate members, with a vested interest in getting a special position and perhaps could eventually exclude less well off or individual members because it provides for more than one vote and particularly because of the extra investment they could afford in their own self-interest in this fisheries development and the fisheries within this co-operative society could then demand that the fee be decided on that kind of privilege and extra investment.  This section reeks of a kind of privilege and to a certain extent allows the abuse or use of this to corporate members with money, with interest, and maybe with a motivation for their own reasons to annex parts of fisheries or waters that we all regard as national, natural and open to the public.  That investment might give certain members an undue influence on the co-operative societies and perhaps in respect of the fisheries we want to leave open as a national asset.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Barnes is proposing the deletion of the section.  On reflection I think the section is so badly flawed that there is not much point in pursuing my amendment.

I strongly support her amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred to this already but perhaps saying a few words on section 8 with regard to corporate membership would not be amiss at this stage.  During the course of negotiations with individual anglers and groups of anglers the <i>cri de coeur</i> from them all the <Col N="468" /> time was that they had over the years put a great deal of money and effort into the development of angling but they got no recognition whatsoever for this.  It was on that basis the idea of corporate management was introduced by me into the Bill and it was appreciated, judging by the correspondence I got.  There was a danger, if one accepted open-ended sponsorship, of having the heavy wallet brought to bear on membership in the co-operative societies and this would not be good for the societies and it would not be good for the development of fishing. We decided that where an angling club had developed amenities in their area&mdash; remember it is one member one vote&mdash; they could subscribe an amount of money to cover ten or 20 members.  If they wanted to cover 20 members they would have to pay £240.  It is important to realise that the share certificate would attach to the individual member.</P>
      <P>In many of the negotiations I had, I was told that many people who did very well out of, say, angling tourism never made any contribution at all and that the fruit of the work of the clubs was enjoyed by business people, restaurateurs, guesthouses, hotels and so on who had no opportunity to make any subscription, the old idea of sponsorship, so to speak, or <i>leitourgia</i>, providing a public service. Section 8 will provide these people with an opportunity of subscribing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the procedure involved.  If an hotel, maharajah or horse owner decides to subscribe £1,000 for the development of a fishery they will get one share certificate only.  I do not think this has been fully grasped but it is important that people realise this.  Therefore, there is no question of a lack of democracy or of anyone having power through their cheque book.  If people fully grasped this idea, which was subject to criticism by Deputy Barnes and Deputy Garland, any fears in this regard would evaporate.  The only motivation behind this provision was to give recognition to the clubs and to their contribution to the development of our fisheries, and to give people of good <Col N="469" /> will, whoever they might be, an opportunity to subscribe to the development of inland fisheries in their areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise what the Minister and the people with whom he had discussions were getting at.  I accept that angling clubs and other groups who did not make any contribution got more than their fair share of fishing rights.  It is extraordinarily difficult to include in legislation a section which recognises the contributions made by some people and which deals at the same time with the fears I have in this area.</P>
      <P>I agree totally with the Minister that a maharajah or someone else might want to give £1,000 out of the goodness of his heart because he loves a certain stretch of water and the people living there. However, as the Minister is well aware from experience, people who make a gesture of goodwill very often have their own self-interests at heart, on which they will collect later.  This is what worries me about this provision.  I am afraid that it could be manipulated in the way I outlined earlier.</P>
      <P>The recognition the Minister is attempting to incorporate in this section might more properly be incorporated in the rules and regulations which are open to amendment and are flexible.  With the consent of the Minister, the rules and regulations could very from area to area. The rules and regulations would be flexible enough to allow co-operatives to protect themselves against the type of manipulation to which I have referred. As we know, it has taken three years to bring this legislation before the House. If an attempt was made to manipulate this section in the manner outlines by me, how long would it take this House to introduce amending legislation, debate it, vote on it and enact it?  I am concerned about any section which would allow for manipulation which would take us a long time to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that recognition should be given to the contributions made by sincere people working in this area.  However, this should be provided for in the rules and <Col N="470" /> regulations which would have a certain flexibility which unfortunately this section does not have.  That is why I raised the matter again.  I know that, like me, the Minister would be absolutely appalled at any manipulation of this provision but, as we know, this is a possibility. In order to show the sincerity of my concern about this matter.  I will press my amendment.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(3) For any fee which is increased under subsection (2) of this section, the amount of such increase shall not exceed the rate of <Col N="471" /> inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>Section 10 gives the Minister the power to increase the fee for a share certificate. Under this section, an annual share certificate will cost £12, a 21 day certificate will cost £5, and a three day certificate &mdash; presumably this would be purchased by someone who wants to try his or her hand at fishing &mdash; will cost £3.  Under the Bill as it stands the Minister will have a right to make an order altering the level of the fee at any time.  As I said on Committee Stage, I am concerned that the Minister may use this power to increase the level of fees of the share certificates up to the fee for a rod licence and even beyond it. I am simply proposing that the fee for a share certificate should not exceed the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index.  I think Deputy Garland put down a similar amendment on Committee Stage and that the Minister indicated a willingness then to give favourable consideration to such amendment.</P>

If I tied the level of the fee to the consumer price index, we would end up with all kinds of weird fractions.  I amended the rules so that any increase would be made with the consent of the majority of societies.  That was agreed on Committee Stage.  Nothing could be more democratic than that.  Deputy Gilmore wanted 70 per cent instead of 60 per cent but he will accept that if a majority of the societies agree to an increase then that is the democratic decision of the societies and it is better than to have to fiddle around with fractions and the consumer price index.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister informed the House last night that according to the legal opinion available to her from the Attorney General, the Bill is flawed and inoperable.  I thank the Minister for the courtesy she extended to me today in examining and discussing with her that legal opinion.  During the day I also sought legal opinion on the Bill.  While the discussion I had was quite detailed, it was not as considered as I would have wished, and we will be coming back with a more considered opinion on a number of issues next week.  One of the points which came in the discussion last night in terms of providing reserved places for teachers and parents was whether the <Col N="475" /> VECs should be extended from a membership of 14 to 18.  The Minister's advise is that there would be problems with this. However, from my discussions today and my examination of the Bill, it seems that a simple amendment to increase the number of members from 14 to 18 would not create any problems.</P>
      <P>I am not usually in favour of increasing the membership of committees.  Smaller committees, by and large, tend to be more efficient and operate at a level which is more beneficial to the recipients of the service, in this case students in vocational schools and regional colleges. Having considered the matter again during the day I believe the extension of the membership from 14 to 18 would be a good idea, taking all the factors into consideration.  As I said last night, there are people who have long served on vocational education committees in trade unions, chambers of commerce, churches and so on who have made considerable contributions to vocational education committees, to the education system generally and to the growth of services.</P>
      <P>Two subsections in section 8 of the 1930 Act, subsections (1) and (3), could be amended to delete &ldquo;14&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;18&rdquo;.  That would get us past the first hurdle.  A number of problems were mentioned last night regarding the method of election for parents, and I discussed this matter with the Minister today. However, having looked at section 8 (4) of the original Act I believe a simple addendum, to that subsection would get us past the second hurdle.  The additional people could be taken on by way of election by the VEC.  The section refers to a local authority electing persons to be members of a vocational education committee. If the section remains intact and the final election is carried out by the local authority it would be appropriate to include an addendum along the following lines, &ldquo;but who must be employed within the scheme and two must be parents of students who are pupils within the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter is the method of election. Several problems would arise in <Col N="476" /> connection with second level schools in the vocational sector, for instance, there are one year courses such as secretarial courses, post-leaving cart courses and so on.  Children on such courses in vocational schools may not necessarily have attended the vocational school during their second level education proper.  In order that the register of parents who would be electors be as complete as possible it must be entered up on a specific date and the parents and guardians of all the children attending schools within the vocational education committee scheme should go on the register as of that date.  Guardians should be included as well as parents.  Those who care for children attending courses or schools within the scheme should have a say in who represents them.</P>
    <P>Another important question is who will carry out the election, who will be the returning officer.  That problem could be resolved by the election to the committee being carried out by the local authority, the local authority being directed by way of circular from the Minister on how to accept nominations for the four extra places, two for teachers and two for parents.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister dealt with the matter of other unions from within the vocational education sector.  In the spirit of PESP, and of extended industrial democracy and worker participation, it is only right that all employees within the scheme should have a say in the staff representation.  The <i>de facto</i> situation is that teachers in any vocational education scheme would have the vast majority of members who could vote, but it is only proper that all trade unionists within the scheme should have a say in who should represent them.</P>
    <P>A point that has been made to me about semi-State bodies is that the going rate is one-third of the board.  In justice and equity if there is to be worker participation then those who work within the scheme should have a say.  The teachers would have the majority vote and, inevitably, it would be teachers who represent the staff, but others employed in the scheme should have their say.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> The position of parents of children at second level is straightforward enough in that virtually all the children are minors. A different position exists in regard to regional colleges within the scheme.  Students in those colleges &mdash; and the Minister alluded to this point last night &mdash; would in the main be 18 years of age or older.  At that age people can vote, they can join the Army, die for their country and so on.  There is an anomaly in the whole system in that people who are 18 and over are adults in every sense, but in the assessment of income for scholarships at third level institutions &mdash; not all students at regional colleges are in receipt of ESF grants which, unlike scholarships, are not means tested &mdash; the young adult's entitlement is based on his or her parents' income.  The issue is taken further when one considers those students who finish their third level education and are then unlucky enough not to obtain employment. If they apply for unemployment assistance their entitlement is again assessed in terms of their parents' income.  By and large, students at third level institutions are over 18, and the argument rests in favour of student representation on the VECs.  I understand that university students already have such representation as of right.  A small number of students at third level colleges will not be 18 years of age and their parents should vote for the parent representatives on their VEC.</P>
    <P>I am approaching the debate in what I hope is a constructive way.  The Labour Party will come back to the House next week with a more considered legal opinion and in doing so we will seek to resolve a problem that must be resolved now or within the next few weeks.  As I stated last night, if the format is not changed now then the present position will continue for five to seven years.  That is completely unacceptable considering undertakings for teacher representation given by the Minister to the TUI on several occasions.  In recent times the Minister made very positive sounds about meaningful parental involvement in the schools at management level.  There is parental representation on boards of <Col N="478" /> management at various levels in education, but the VECs are the only solid administrative structure for schools in any of the areas.  Just as teachers have a very important and unique contribution to make in the business of VECs, the same applies to parents.  When there is a will to achieve something it can be done. This may involve further amendments, as I suggested last night.</P>
    <P>If the Minister brings in any appropriate amendments or if other amendments arise which will achieve the objective of reserving places for teachers and parents, we will certainly go along with it.  As a teacher who benefited a great deal in my career from parent support, I can say that parents are a great resource.  At times there might be concern among teachers in relation to interference in their professional business and this is already covered in the legislation for VECs.  I have not seen any real effort by parent representatives to interfere at that level.  I have always found parent representatives on boards of management to be constructive and enthusiastic. They become involved to assist their own children and in doing so help all children.</P>
    <P>From the industrial relations point of view it is important to have teachers there.  It is important in the broad concept of social or industrial democracy which is a large part of the PESP philosophy which has found support on all sides of the House.  The role played by public representatives on VECs has been constructive and there has not been a tendency to split along party lines on issues.  They do not play politics and goodness knows, in the past few years because of cutbacks in education there has been ample opportunity for Opposition politicians to exploit the position politically.  I am glad that has not happened and that we have recognised that there is a political arena in which to fight political issues.</P>
    <P>In terms of the management of a scheme, such as the vocational education scheme, and the management of schools, schools must keep within their allocation in relation to teachers and so on.  It is <Col N="479" /> up to schools to fight their corner when looking for additional provisions. However, I am glad that debates on vocational education committees have not turned into circuses in my area.</P>
    <P>The contribution of public representatives is a very important part of the vocational education scheme.  We all know of many individuals who have contributed unselfishly to this scheme over many years.  I alluded last night to the importance of the interface of industry and commerce with vocational education committees.  As we move into the last decade of the century the scope then becomes even greater.  Those involved in industry and commerce, whether at management or trade union level, have a good knowledge of the type of education, the type of courses necessary so that people in an area on coming through the system will have the skills and education to take up all positions in companies.</P>
    <P>In the past there was a tendency to see vocational schools as schools taking students who were not high achievers. The advent of the community colleges, and the major changes in vocational schools over the past number of years, have highlighted this misinterpretation. The standard achieved throughout the country at vocational level, at second level, is tremendous.  People often forget that vocational education committees provide a wide range of courses ranging from adult literacy through to degree level courses.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will come back with a more considered position next week. We are doing this in a constructive way. There is a high level of consensus in the House in relation to teacher participation on VECs and in terms of having reserved places for parents as well.  Following legal consultation I am convinced that all things are possible if the will is there.  It is very important to tackle this problem. The Minister afforded me the courtesy of showing me her legal advice in relation to this Bill and discussing it.  The debate should not be conducted in the terms of breaking down opposition.  There should be a constructive input from all of us <Col N="480" /> so that the two important principles of industrial democracy on the one hand and meaningful parent involvement on the other can be achieved and put in place after the local elections when the new VECs are set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the basic principle of the Bill.  There is no difficulty with the notion of allowing representation from parents, teachers and others in education.  For too long parents have been excluded from the whole process of education.  They were excluded from contributing anything worthwhile to the process and to the general policy area of education.  I compliment the Minister on encouraging the involvement of parents in all aspects of education.  She should be praised for that.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years the Minister has encouraged active participation by parents on parent associations and boards of management.  The Minister frequently met various parent associations and has given them verbal encouragement.  She also put her money where her mouth is on several occasions and provided finance. Recently she reiterated her commitment to getting parents involved in as many activities associated with education as possible.  That will be acknowledged by Members on all sides of the House and it is a move which I welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very welcome aspect is the encouragement which teachers have been giving to parents to become involved.  I was a teacher and I know that very often and for far too long teachers treated parents with suspicion and did more to discourage them than to encourage them to become involved in the school.  The role most teachers saw for parents was simply one of fund-raising for a piece of equipment or organising external activities like mock interviews and so on.  That was the extent to which <Col N="481" /> teachers wanted to see parents involved. I am not sure whether all the teaching profession are fully committed to the idea of parent involvement in education but there is a welcome move to see parents involved in more areas than fund-raising or peripheral activities in relation to the school.  Teachers are obviously interested in education and they should be involved. I was a little surprised at a speaker saying last night that teachers were not involved to any great extent on VECs.  Most of the VECs of which I am aware have teachers represented: without having statutory provision for it most VECS, certainly in 1985 after the last local elections, agreed to have either one or two teachers as members on the VECs.</P>
    <P>If teachers are to become more involved and if we are to make statutory provision to have two teachers within the system on vocational education committees, they will have to broaden their horizons.  From my experience and from speaking to colleagues on VECs round the country, TUI people who are members of VECs have tended to focus very largely on the narrow, union-type issues.  I am sure there are notable exceptions but it has been my experience that teachers have tended to look after a union point of view instead of being concerned with the broader issues of education.  If the time comes &mdash; and I am sure it will &mdash; when provision is made on a statutory basis or on the basis of a circular from the Minister, teachers within the system will become, as of right, members of vocational education committees.  I appeal to them to broaden their horizons and not to see their role as one of just defending teacher or union interests but to see it as one of contributing their vast knowledge, skills and experience to the formulation of general educational policies.</P>
    <P>Another welcome aspect of the Bill is the concept of encouraging more active interest in education in local areas; we should not confine and narrow this.  One of my criticisms of the Bill is that is confines representation to two parents and two teachers.  If we intend to increase the membership of VECs and if we intend <Col N="482" /> to increase it by four, as suggested, we should not limit it to two parents and two teachers, but should expand and broaden our horizons and try to involve employers, people in youth organisations in the local community and in non-formal education programmes.</P>
    <P>Points have been made in relation to the difficulties associated with this Bill on which I will dwell for a moment.  The Bill, will all due respect to the draftsman, is totally inadequate, impractical and inoperable.  I could use various other words to describe it but I am trying to be charitable.  It is also very vague.  Deputy O'Shea referred to parents voting for their representatives on a VEC.  Take the area of compiling the register: all that is said here is that parents will have a right to elect two parents, one of each gender, of pupils attending second level schools under the control of the VEC in question. There is nothing in it about compiling the registers, how they will be compiled and when.  Deputy O'Shea made a suggestion earlier which would probably be fairly practical but I should like to know who will compile the register at a particular date or time.  The VECs and Opposition Members said at various times that they have been put to the pin of their collars because they are under-staffed and none of us disagree with that, although the situation has greatly improved within the last six months and will continue to improve.  Do they have time to compile registers of parents and teachers?  Who will oversee the compilation of registers? In the case of the election who will act as the returning officers?  Where and how will the elections be held?  There are many areas where huge problems could arise for everyone involved and which the Bill does not address.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (c) provides that in the case of ballots referred to in subsections (a) and (b), each vocational committee shall conduct the said ballots in accordance with regulations made by the Minister.  It does not say when the ballots will be held.  There does not appear to be any restriction in relation to the time in which the VECs will conduct a ballot.  Will it be before or after elections?  It will be in <Col N="483" /> accordance with what the VECs think fit, so time does not appear to be a consideration. VECs could delay the ballots for parents and teachers indefinitely, but that issue is not addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another problem which could arise is that the Bill refers to not less than two teachers, one of each gender.  Both teachers could end up in the one school.</P>

      <P>If the purpose of the Bill is to give teachers a greater say on vocational education committees it would not be of help nor democratic if both teachers were to come from the one school.  That is one of the weaknesses of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill attempts to change section 8 (4) of the Vocational Education Act which is very wide ranging and allows vocational education committees to appoint or elect anyone they like to a committee.  Following the local elections in 1985 County Meath Vocational Education Committee decided to reserve places for teachers and parents on the committee.  In fact, they decided, apart from a vocational teacher, that a primary teacher should be given a place on the committee.  The Bill before the House does not advert to teachers other than teachers within the scheme.  If Deputy Higgins and his party are anxious to ensure that parents and teachers are represented on vocational education committees then, following the local elections, the parties concerned should try to reach agreement to allow parents, teachers and others &ldquo;with an interest and experience in education&rdquo; to become members of vocational education committees. If Second Stage is agreed it is obvious it will not be passed before the local elections.  Given that the parties agree with the principle it might be better if the parties concerned at local level sat down together shortly after the local elections and suggested that parents and teachers be nominated by agreement to be members of vocational education committees.  That is one practical way of approaching the matter and there would not be a need for a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last time out County Meath Vocational Education Committee agreed that a teacher should represent the interests of teachers within the scheme <Col N="485" /> on the committee.  Indeed, there is one professor &mdash; I think all members are parents &mdash; one secondary teacher, one vocational teacher and one national teacher on the committee.  I spoke to a number of my colleagues and learned that it is not unusual to have a number of teachers on a committee, even though it may be unusual to have a professor as a member.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, in proposing a Bill such as this, is going to narrow his options. The vocational education system is a very good and solid one.  It has produced many fine students and provides a high standard of education.  It has been able to do this because of the nature of the people serving on the committees which are providing a wide range of activities. However, if we accept the Bill we will confine ourselves too much.  If the intention is to add four members to vocational education committees, we should expand the membership of the committee by four and then amend section 8 (4) of the Vocational Education Act to allow the committees to avail of a broader range of experience rather than just parents and teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the Bill in that it provides us with an opportunity to discuss vocational education. Indeed, any Bill which provides us with an opportunity to discuss education is to be welcomed.  However, the Minister pointed out last night, the Bill is seriously flawed and off beam.  I am sure the Green Paper and the Bill which will be introduced by the Minister will acknowledge the major role played by the vocational education sector.</P>
      <P>I have a great grá for the vocational education system.  I was a member of County Wexford Vocational Education Committee between 1979 and 1986 and I was turfed out.  I consider the committee to be one of the best I served on and far better than any county council or urban council.  The members of that committee are very committed to the education system, in particular vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I have such a high regard <Col N="486" /> for the vocational education system, and the teachers in particular, is that students do not have to be means tested.  They are taken in regardless of class, creed or capability.  There are no selection procedures to pick out the best students. Tremendous results have been achieved in both the intermediate and leaving certificate. Indeed, the results achieved in many of the vocational schools in the leaving certificate were far better than those achieved by some of the other schools in the country.  This proves beyond doubt that the teachers are of the highest calibre and are playing a tremendous role in the education of our young people.</P>
    <P>A number of vocational schools were opened in County Wexford by the previous Coalition Government and some by the present Government. These are of the highest quality. Enniscorthy Vocational College recently presented each house in the Enniscorthy area with a glossy brochure which outlined what the school has to offer and the reasons students leaving primary school should attend that school.  It amazed me that such a brochure was available, as I have never seen such a brochure from any school in County Wexford.  It was a very good idea and very encouraging for parents to see that a school of such high quality and standard offering many different courses from computers through the academic subjects, had places on offer.</P>
    <P>While the Bill before us gives us an opportunity to discuss vocational education, I wonder if it would be before us if Fianna Fáil did not have the majority on the local authorities at present.  I remember that Fine Gael held the chair of the Wexford VEC for over 20 years because Fine Gael and the Labour Party had the majority on the county council. There was no sharing of the chair between the parties.  It is political hypocrisy to say that in the years from 1979, when Fianna Fáil did not have a majority, and when the Coalition were in Government, 1982-85, there was no movement to bring in this Bill, to have changes <Col N="487" /> made or to put parent or teacher representatives on the VEC.</P>
    <P>However, I am glad to say that in 1985 the County Wexford VEC, following a majority decision of Wexford County Council, appointed a representative of the parents associated in the county, Mr. Tom Keogh, a very valued member of County Wexford Vocational Education Committee who is making a very valuable contribution on behalf of the parents. The majority of members on the County Wexford Vocational Education Committee are parents and know what is required of their children and the type of education needed.</P>
    <P>I have no hang ups about the present structures of the VEC, because I know that in County Wexford they are doing a good job.  Having said that, however, I have no objection to it becoming part of any future legislation that a member of the TUI and a member of the parents' association would become members of VECs and I hope &mdash; and this was mentioned in the Minister's speech &mdash; she will write to the local authorities asking them to take into account the possibility of having parent and teacher involvement in the vocational education committees following the local elections.  I hope that will be taken on board and that we will see a teacher and a parent involved in each committee.  As I have said already County Wexford and some other counties have taken the lead and I hope others will follow.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill before us tonight is a little narrow.  There are many different areas of education within the VEC and it begs the question whether the different strands should have a representative on the vocational education committees, for example should there be a member from the parents' association, the TUI and the adult education committee, which also provide very valuable services in each county?  I would like to see adult education or second chance education expanded further, and I know that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is committed to second chance education <Col N="488" /> for people who did not get the opportunity when they were younger.  I would like to see a representative, possibly the chairman of the adult education committee or some member of that committee being an active member of the VEC because they would have a major role to play.</P>
    <P>The contribution that industry can make is often overlooked.  Vocational education prepares the young people who go on to become apprentice mechanics, carpenters, blocklayers or whatever.  We should ask ourselves whether industry should have a representative on vocational education committees.  I would like to see better links between the VECs and the workplace and that is why I put forward the suggestion tonight that when vocational education committees are being set up they would consider having industry represented.  A person from the real world of industry would be in a position to advise on the best opportunities for apprentices.  I have seen a glut of apprentices in one area where there are no job opportunities but where there are numerous opportunities for young people to participate in the workforce, they are not being trained or do not have the necessary skills to become involved.  I know we will have a further opportunity to discuss this when the Green Paper becomes available, but I would ask the Minister to consider having a representative from the industrial area participating in vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Generally the vocational education committees provide a very good service. They have played a key role over many years providing an educational system that is top class and is available to all young people regardless of their background. I take this opportunity to compliment the vocational education committees and vocational teachers in particular on providing a great service for students up and down the country.  I, like the Minister, am not technically or legally minded.  The Minister said that on the legal advice available to her the Bill was flawed and inoperable.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives us the opportunity to <Col N="489" /> discuss vocational education and that of itself is very important.</P>

      <P>The arguments put forward by the two previous speakers, Deputies Dempsey and Browne, are extraordinarily weak and show an enormous lack of understanding of the 1930 Act and the VEC system.

      <P>This proposed amendment to the Vocational Education Act, 1930, is long overdue.  We all agree that the Act has served this country well and could be considered one of the most progressive pieces of legislation ever passed.  This can be seen in the relatively few times the Act has had to be amended. However, in the light of modern thinking my party propose to amend section 8 of the 1930 Act.</P>
      <P>There are 38 vocational education committees throughout the country which manage vocational schools, community colleges, regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The committees are composed of 14 persons of whom a minimum of five and a maximum of eight must be elected councillors.  The balance of the representation is made up of nominees of the local authorities who, inevitably, are representatives of the various political parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original idea in the 1930 Act for allowing the local authorities to nominate members was that people who had expertise in education could be put on the committees.  Unfortunately, we must all agree that this idea has been totally <Col N="490" /> lost.  The nominated members of the vocational education committees tend to be, in the main, people who have worked for the political party which controls the local authority.  Indeed, I might add that all parties are guilty in this area.  Membership of a VEC should not be a thank you for services rendered.  People should be nominated because they have something definite to contribute.  Although this is the intention of the 1930 Act, it is not happening, and that means that the Bill before us tonight must be introduced in order to ensure such participation.</P>
    <P>Personally I have a great interest in this Bill because I am one of a few people in this House who is both a member of a vocational education committee and a former teacher in a vocational school. Having spent 15 years as a teacher in a vocational school and seven years as a member of the VEC in South Tipperary, I have seen at first hand the lack of input of parents and teachers.  I have also seen the need for this input and I am delighted that this amendment seeks to rectify that situation.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes that each vocational education committee consist of not less than two parents, one of each gender, of pupils attending second level schools under the control of the vocational committee.  I find it difficult to see how anyone could oppose this.  Surely the parents of the pupils have every moral right to be represented on the body that makes decisions about the school which their sons and daughters attend.  Their expertise on what is best for their children is a necessary input into debates at VEC level.  This right has already been conceded on boards of primary and voluntary secondary schools.  In some of these cases the rule is that at least one of the parents on the board must be a mother.  This sometimes gives rise to a situation where there are two mothers on the board and no father.  Our amendment seeks to redress this.  The amendment insists on the rights of fathers to be represented too.  That is why we provide for two parents, one of each gender.  While we might accept that traditionally mothers have been the Ministers of education in <Col N="491" /> Irish homes, we would like to insist that fathers too share this role.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education recently spoke about the importance of parents having a say in the running of schools.  I totally agree with her.  I find it inconceivable then and hard to understand how she has difficulty in supporting this amendment.  This Bill is a reasonable call for a change in the present 1930 Act.  It is generally agreed now by management theorists that worker participation is beneficial to the running of any organisation. Our State companies already have worker directors.  Our amendment merely seeks to extend this concept to the State educational system.  If it is a good idea in industry then it is a good idea in education.  It is high time for workers in all areas to have more say in the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>While teachers may be represented on a few VECs, this is merely due to a local arrangement.  Teachers are not, by right, members of the VEC.  Our amendment wants parents and teachers to be members as of right.  We do not want parents and teachers to be beholden to some political party for their representations.</P>
    <P>The schools cannot run efficiently without the wholehearted co-operation of the teachers.  This wholehearted co-operation of the teachers has been there in abundance in the past and will be in the future.  It is just good management practice that people who work all day, every day in the schools should have a say at decision-making level.  The decision-making process is flawed without their contribution.  This resource, this expertise, this goodwill of the teachers is available to the VECs, but in the past, it has not been used.  This amendment before the House will not just encourage but direct VECs to use the expertise of teachers in making their decisions.</P>
    <P>The amendment also directs that the teachers nominated should be one of each gender.  Fine Gael are committed to ensuring that women get their rightful representation at various levels of society <Col N="492" /> and this is why we have inserted this clause in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifies the methods by which the parent members and teacher members of the VECs should be selected. A ballot of all the parents is the fairest method and I do not think anyone will seriously quibble with this.  It is difficult to think of a better method.  However, if someone can think of a better method it would be easy to insert it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The teacher representatives should be elected by a ballot of all the full-time teachers in each VEC area.  We looked at the idea of part-time teachers having a vote, but in the end we decided against it, because part-time teachers tend to be somewhat transitory and it would be unfair to give a vote to teachers who may be in a school for just a year in electing the members of a VEC which would be in office for at least five years.</P>
    <P>For too long parents have been fundraisers and teamakers.  They are always available and readily welcomed for raising funds for the extra computer, for more resources, for sport, for whatever is necessary to provide better education and facilities for their children.  Their contribution in this regard is worthy of the recognition it deserves, but their role must be greater than this.  They have so much to offer to educational debate and decision-making.  They now have their own association, PAVE, which highlights constantly the educational needs of their children in VEC schools.  Anyone aware of the work, dedication and aspirations of PAVE would not only agree but, in fact, insist on them having representation on the VECs.  They have proven consistent, fair, aware and honest in working for the welfare of students in VEC schools.</P>
    <P>They have won for themselves observer status in many VECs, the most frustrating and unfulfilling status that any one can have.  We, in Fine Gael, are adamant that they will have full membership of the VEC.  They deserve this status and, furthermore, the VECs would benefit from such representation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> For too long, teachers have been confined to the classroom, denied any participation in the very body that manages and directs the essence of their everyday work.  Surely it is incredible that teachers with so many ideas, wanting to grasp new opportunities, open new horizons, broaden the curriculum, determined to make school life meaningful to all and constantly trying to improve teaching techniques have no place to air, promote or initiate their concerns and views.  I believe that their membership of the VECs would not only enhance their present role, but they would contribute to and direct the debate towards the needs of the students today.  It is vital that representation be given to all concerned and interested in the education decision-making process.</P>
    <P>We must look to the past at what teachers in VECs have given to vocational education.  The TUI members have proven to be progressive and innovative. They have displayed an enormous capacity for change.  They answered the call for industrialisation in the forties. They moved with ease from providing a junior cycle to providing a senior cycle. They are there yet again to answer the call to technology in providing computer courses.  They made themselves available to educate those who, unfortunately, did not have the opportunity when they were young, by providing adult education. They too initiated the course run in our regional technical colleges.  They are the people who are making tremendous efforts to provide post-leaving certificate education for those who do not get to regional colleges or university.  Given that contribution to education, surely they deserve a place on our VECs.  Without their representation many of our VEC members would not be aware of what is going on in the schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister constantly says that she is committed to participation by parents but she opposes this Bill on the weakest excuse; it can only be summarised as dodging the issue.  She is claiming that the Bill is flawed and inoperable.  This Bill is at all times open to amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> I can summarise the Minister's objections into three categories.  First, she argues against the provision of not fewer than two parents and not fewer than two teachers, claiming we have no limit on the number of parents and teachers who can be represented on our VECs.  That can be cleared up adequately by amendments on Committee Stage insisting that local authorities decide on the number who can be represented.  She asked who is to decide on the number of parents and teachers who should be members of the VECs.  No person or group of persons is given power to decide this in the legislation. Again I see no problem about accepting an amendment that this be passed on to the local authority.  The Minister dealt at length with the appointment of teachers' and parents' representatives and wondered how long their period of membership would last.  Surely their membership of the VEC, like that of other members will lapse when local authority elections are called.</P>
    <P>I see no problem about dealing with any legal arguments, if there are any or any differences of opinion.  It would be unusual for the House to pass a Bill without it being amended.  This Bill is no different.  Any differences of opinion or any problems or worries can be sorted out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat alarmed when Deputy Dempsey implied that teachers are more interested in defending the interests of their unions than in the interests of the students.  That is a serious allegation to make against teachers and it shows an enormous lack of knowledge of the dedication and interest of teachers in our vocational schools.  They devote an enormous amount of time to their students. The Deputy posed weighty questions about how parents and teachers would be elected to VECs.  One wonders how we could ever have a Presidential election or a general election considering the huge problems Deputy Dempsey foresaw in electing two parents.  Again, this can be discussed and a solution found.  Worst of all his final argument was that the Bill would not be through both Houses before the June elections.  That is hardly a very <Col N="495" /> strong argument, considering that commencing tomorrow the University of Limerick (Dissolution of Thomond College) Bill amalgamating two colleges will be passed in two days.  The Finance Bill was passed within one week.  I cannot understand why Deputy Dempsey believes that an amendment proposing four extra members on a VEC cannot be passed within the next month.</P>
    <P>In a recent letter the Minister called for more parents' associations.  Parents want representation at decision-making level.  Passive roles have existed for too long.  We want to give parents a role where the authority lies.  There must be real recognition of the role of parents and teachers in the education of children today.</P>
    <P>The Minister used the occasion to detail all the progress made, as she saw it.  Indeed, she congratulated herself on all she has done to ensure participation of teachers and parents.  Whey then are VECs an exception?  Why is there no specific representation for parents and teachers on VECs?  Why is the Minister reluctant to co-operate with us and help to improve the position if she is unhappy about it?  We want to ensure representation of parents and teachers on our VECs.  We have heard about Bills to come, Green Papers in progress and so on but the Minister would take a major step forward if she supported this Bill.  It is necessary to have representation at all levels of education.  Teachers and parents must be represented at all levels of the education decision-making process.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not, as the Minister said, premature; it is long overdue.  Only with its passing can real partnership in education be achieved.  The terms of the Bill are reasonable, fair, just and capable of implementation.  I hope Members of all parties will have no objection to the Bill. Indeed, the great surprise is that nobody thought of bringing in such a measure sooner.  I appeal to Members to give parents and teachers a say in the running of the schools.</P>

      <P>I am happy to have an opportunity, brief as it is, to make a contribution to this debate and I compliment Deputy Higgins on moving this Bill.</P>
      <P>As chairman of the Cavan Parents Committee of Cavan vocational school, I have first hand knowledge of the role of the vocational education system.  I have a high regard for it.  Deputy Higgins's Bill is very timely.  It is regrettable that nobody saw fit to move such a Bill many years ago.  It would be more regrettable if for any reason we were prevented from enacting this very important legislation that would allow parent-teacher representation on VECs.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's attitude. I was disappointed that a person for whom I have a high regard saw fit to shoot down this Bill.  In her speech last night she said the Bill was a very short one.  It is because it is full of detail and not of waffle.  The Minister said the Bill sought to give representation on VECs for two parents and two teachers and she was in sympathy with the thinking behind the proposal.  However, the best legal advice to her was that the Bill was flawed and inoperable.  I am not a legal person, but I do not accept that.  If there was a will on the Government side of the House amendments could be prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to note support from the different parties for the Bill and I believe there is support from the Fianna Fáil Party, if not from the Government, for tabling amendments to the Bill.  The rank and file of that party know as well as I that the role of parents and teachers in education is highly important and never more so than at present when there are so many developments and problems arising that only parents with children at school can appreciate.  Parents, therefore, can offer their opinion and advice on those problems to the committees who govern the vocational education system.  To coin a phrase, the Minister's attitude was childish.  She sulked, obviously, because she had not introduced the Bill.  I regret <Col N="497" /> she is not present to hear me say that. She would do herself a great deal of good if, having considered the proposals in the Bill over the weekend, she came back next week and said she had second thoughts and better legal advice about it. The advice she received was given for the sole purpose of highlighting the difficulties, and they are not major.  It would not be difficult to overcome whatever provisions in the Bill are not acceptable to the Minister.  Perhaps following the weekend we will see a change of mind by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In supporting the vocational education system I am well aware that many people and, to an extent, the Department of Education regarded vocational education as a system for children who had problems learning, children from a certain section of the community and those who wished to follow a trade.  Vocational schools were the first to offer second level students a broader range of subjects than just academic subjects, for example, woodwork, metalwork and various other crafts.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 12, after &ldquo;a&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy G. O'Sullivan.) </P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long debate on this amendment on the last occasion we discussed the Bill.  In the meantime I have had occasion to look at the way the Bill is framed and I have to say that I have not changed my mind about the necessity for this amendment. It is very important that this aspect of the Bill is considered very carefully.  My amendment proposes that only a suitably <Col N="498" /> qualified member of the Garda Síochána should be appointed as an inspector.  On the last occasion we debated the Bill the Minister indicated that a member of the Garda Síochána would only be present as a back-up for the inspector who would have the responsibility of checking any ships coming into our ports.  I have looked carefully at the Bill which provides that a member of the Garda Síochána could be appointed as an inspector.  I have to emphasise that I have no axe to grind with any member of the Garda Síochána who would be appointed as an inspector but the Bill should specify the qualifications of an inspector.  This is very important as section 23 (3) categorically provides that:</P>
      <P>If the harbourmaster has refused entry under section (1), the Minister, or a person appointed under subsection (2), may direct the harbour-master to permit the ship to enter, and to comply with such conditions as may be specified, in which case the harbourmaster shall permit the ship to enter the harbour upon such conditions, and the master of the ship shall comply with the said conditions. </P>
      <P>The Minister said that an inspector appointed by his Department would be suitably qualified for the job.  I do not doubt his word for one moment.  I fully accept that inspectors of the Department of the Marine are highly qualified, and they have proved this over and over again in various ways.  I would be the first to admit this.  However, the Bill provides that a member of the Garda Síochána can be appointed as an inspector.  This is where I disagree with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the Minister to either include the words &ldquo;fully qualified&rdquo; in section 3 or to delete this subsection.  It would be a travesty of justice if a member of the Garda Síochána was empowered to order a harbourmaster to do certain things.  As I said, a harbourmaster is a very qualified person.  Usually he has a master's ticket and does a first class job. However outlandish it may seem to us here this evening, under this Bill a member of the Garda Síochána could, <Col N="499" /> technically speaking, order a harbourmaster to do certain things.  The Minister will probably say this cannot happen, but unfortunately this is possible under the Bill as framed.</P>
    <P>I believe the people who drafted the Bill did not recognise this point.  They probably took into account small ports where there is no harbour authority and believed that the local garda sergeant would be the ideal person to look after the harbour.  I accept this to a certain extent but I want to point out that we are framing legislation which will probably be on the Statute Book for a long time. I am anxious to ensure that this legislation is as tight as we can make it.  There is a flaw in this section which the Minister should address.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with a surveyor of ships, a person appointed by warrant of the Minister or an officer holding a commissioned naval rank in the Defence Forces being appointed inspectors.  We have gone aground, so to speak, in regard to the appointment of a member of the Garda Síochána as an inspector.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment which I believe is fair.  If the inclusion of the words &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; removes the Garda Síochána from the system, then so be it.  It is necessary to emphasise that unless the people appointed as inspectors have the same qualifications as harbourmasters, this section will only be a joke.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at my amendment in the light of the other amendments. This is very important.  I appreciate the Minister's statement that the Garda Síochána will provide a back-up service for an inspector &mdash; it would be very necessary to have a Garda Síochána back-up especially if there is trouble &mdash; but the Bill specifically states that a member of the Garda Síochana can become an inspector.  I am concerned about the qualifications of gardaí so appointed.  They may be qualified in the enforcement of law but in this instance they must have the necessary qualifications to carry out their responsibilities in regard to ships which may be polluting <Col N="500" /> our waters.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this section some five months ago and my colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, has refreshed our memories on the problems we have with this section.  We are endeavouring to ensure that any person appointed as an inspector by the Minister knows what he is doing when he is dealing with ships inside or outside a harbour. All we are asking the Minister to do &mdash; I believe this is a reasonable request &mdash; is to ensure that anyone he appoints as an inspector has an adequate knowledge of ships, their characteristics, cargo handling and the international maritime dangerous goods code.  These are matters an inspector will have to deal with if he is trying to rectify the problems outlined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister simply lists people who may be suitably qualified in that section of the Bill to include a member of the Garda Síochána, or a person appointed to be an inspector by warrant of the Minister, or even an officer holding a commissioned naval rank.  He may not have that specialised knowledge which not just we on this side of the House believe is necessary but which the Irish Port Authorities Association also regard as essential. They have voiced their concern to the Minister as far back as 6 December 1990 by letter to him.  In two letters sent to him on that day they have said they are very unhappy with what he is trying to achieve in this section.  I hope that with the passage of five months, the Minister has had an opportunity to examine this matter with his experts in the Department and that he will be convinced that you cannot appoint somebody &mdash; no matter how well they may pursue their own careers and duties, such as a member of the Garda &mdash; to take over control of a ship if they do not have the specialised knowledge which the Irish Port Authorities Association would require of them.  That is all we on this side of the House are trying to achieve.  We are not saying to the Minister he must appoint a harbour master; that is not necessary if <Col N="501" /> the person whom he appoints is a surveyor of ships or has the qualifications which the Irish Port Authorities Association require.</P>
    <P>An example is given in their letter in the case of the <i>Empress of Canada</i> some years ago which was taken over in the Gladstone Dock in Liverpool and because of the incompetence of the gentleman who took it over, the boat foundered and capsized causing a great deal of danger to the port.  Although I believe no lives were lost, the sinking of that ship in the middle of the dock upset the traffic in that area for many months afterwards.  There is need for somebody with expertise to do this job.  All we are asking the Minister is to accept that that is the case and to look at the list of those he has put forward who may be handed warrants to do the job over the head of a harbour master who would obviously need to have these qualifications before he would get the job of harbour master. There are, of course, harbours where there are no harbour masters &mdash; fishery ports, small insignificant ports around the coast where the expertise of a fisherman may be sufficient for the job.  To allow one of our 26 or 27 ports under the Harbours Acts or some of the ports that are not already covered by that act such as Dún Laoghaire or Rosslare to appoint somebody without specialist knowledge would certainly cause a great deal of danger to the whole area if he did not have the qualifications put forward by the Irish Port Authorities Association.  The Irish Port Authorities Association have indicated to the Minister what they believe are the requirements needed.  We on this side of the House believe that is sound advice that should be taken.  That is the purpose of the amendment being put forward in the name of Deputy O'Sullivan, and the Minister should give it solid consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled amendment No. 21a which seeks to insert after &ldquo;person&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;with suitable qualifications and expertise&rdquo;.  This amendment is similar to that tabled by Deputy O'Sullivan.  When we debated this Bill on <Col N="502" /> Second Stage we raised extensive concerns in relation to the definition of &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; in section 3.  We were particularly concerned by the inclusion of the member of the Garda Síochána because the rank is not specified.  We do know that members of the Garda Síochána have a very specific involvement in relation to arresting trawlers which are fishing illegally and that the Naval Service cannot act without having a Garda on board but they seek the civil power to undertake the arrest.  This situation involves complying with the Marpol Convention and issues of harmful substances that can pollute at sea and on shore.  The people concerned need to have specific qualifications and specialist knowledge. They must know exactly what to expect, the entire structure of ships and the various dangers that can arise.  This matter was debated extensively on Second Stage.  All of us on this side of the House saw the merits of the arguments put forward. At that time we prevailed on the Minister to see the validity of our suggestions. I hope the Minister can see that we are not seeking anything extraordinary, revolutionary or radical but rather something we believe can enhance this Bill so that the people concerned would be in a position to implement its terms when it becomes an Act in a professional and knowledgeable way.  As stated on an earlier Stage of the debate, it would be unfair to ask a regular member of the Garda Síochána to undertake some of the very technical and important tasks suggested in the various sections of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Harbours and harbour authorities are managed by harbour boards and harbour masters.  Harbour masters, in most instances, have extremely high qualifications. This is a special area requiring specialist knowledge which does not come by chance, but rather after years of study and work experience.  To put somebody who does not have that background into a position of implementing the terms of this section would be grossly unfair, would make the Bill much less effective and would provide offenders of the Sea Pollution Bill with a defence in the courts.  We should not leave a gap in <Col N="503" /> this section but we should be in a position to foresee the inherent dangers and protect against them.  That is why I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment. The motivation behind it is to improve the Bill and to ensure its implementation so as to have better controls over the type of pollution that can be emitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments. It stands to reason that whoever would be appointed as an inspector would have to be a suitably qualified person. The powers of inspectors under section 21 are wide-ranging, for example, the power to take samples of oil, oily mixtures or to copy any entry in any log book of a ship, or to summon witnesses to appear before them.  Inspectors would have to know what they were doing in relation to such extensive powers. Section 11 deals with the regulations. Presumably an inspector would go on board a ship to ensure that the regulations were being enforced.  There is a very good defence provision in that section, for example, in the case of the discharge into the sea of any oil, oily mixture and so on, the provision is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that all reasonable steps have been taken after the occurrence of the damage or, as the case may be, the discovery of the discharge, to prevent or minimise the discharge and the owner or the master did not act with intent to cause damage or recklessness;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If a person is prosecuted for discharging oil or oily substances into the sea much will hinge on the inspection carried out by the inspector.  It is clearly important that whoever goes on board a ship to take samples, look at log books or interview the people on board, knows what he is doing.  It stands to reason that the people appointed as inspectors should be suitably qualified persons.  This is the type of amendment that the Minister can very readily accept and there should be no difficulty in so doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="504" /> I will take some time with this matter because there seems to be some confusion and there is an onus on me to clarify it.  The confusion is caused by linking section 3, which defines inspector, to section 23 (2).  In the context of section 3, if what the Deputies have said is true there would be a good deal of substance in their arguments but that is not the case.  To insert &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; or &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;Garda Síochána&rdquo; in section 3 would be inappropriate because we would then have to define what suitably qualified means.  As Deputy Gilmore said earlier in the discussion, that would involve laying down qualifications as high as PhD.  A high ranking officer would not necessarily have the expertise that the Deputies have been talking about.  He also might not be available, and again I am talking in the context of section 3 only.</P>
      <P>Section 17 (2) of the Bill makes it clear that the role of a member of the Garda Síochána in an inspection is very restricted indeed, and I would draw the attention of Deputies to that.  He or she may not carry out a survey or inspect or test a ship, its equipment or fittings for compliance with MARPOL requirements. Let us not forget that MARPOL is basic to this Bill.  The intention is that a member of the Garda Síochána or a commissioned officer of the naval service, as is mentioned also in the Bill, would be used to support the technically qualified inspectors by performing such duties as stopping or detaining vessels or crew or dealing with a ship's personnel who for one reason or another might not be co-operative in the particular task.  It is well known that members of the Garda Síochána carry out inspections as sea fisheries protection officers under other merchant shipping and fisheries legislation, for example, the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1988, and the Fisheries Consolidation Act, 1959.  Under these Acts a garda can act as an inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The marine surveyors in my Department are qualified to perform all the functions appropriate to an inspector. Inspectors appointed by the Minister <Col N="505" /> under section 20 would have warrants which would specify the functions they are authorised to perform.  The Minister would have to be satisfied that they are qualified and equipped to perform these functions.  The main purpose of having an inspector appointed under warrant would be to act speedily on receipt of a report of suspected illegal discharge or, say, the detection by aerial surveillance of an oil slick in proximity to a vessel.  The offence could relate to an Irish registered vessel quite a distance away and the marine surveyor of the Department might not be readily available to carry out an inspection at that place.  The emphasis throughout MARPOL and the Sea Pollution Bill is to act without causing under delay.</P>
    <P>As court proceedings for an offence under the Sea Pollution Act would more than likely ensue it would not be prudent for any Minister to appoint an inspector under warrant, someone who is not adequately qualified to exercise his powers as defined under section 21 of the Bill.  From time to time the Minister has occasion to appoint inspectors under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  The House will know that these inspectors carry out inquiries into accidents, damage done to vessels, safety of hull and machinery and compliance with legislation.  As the House knows, I recently had to appoint such an inspector, Captain Kirwan, in the case of the Ballycotton inqury.  The Minister will be asked to exercise his judgment on the advice available to him in deciding who is the best qualified person to conduct that type of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I started off by saying there was a certain confusion with regard to section 3 (1) (d) which the amendment purports to improve and with section 23 (2).  I would draw the attention of the House to section 23 (2) as it has been mentioned already and has been related to section 3.  It states: &ldquo;Where the Minister or a person appointed by the Minister to act on his behalf is satisfied that a ship is a ship to which paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (1) relates, he may, in his absolute discretion, refuse entry into a <Col N="506" /> harbour to such ship.&rdquo;  Deputies will note that the word &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; is not used there and there is no reference whatsoever to the people we have been discussing under section 3.  It simply mentions a person appointed by the Minister &mdash; for example, the Minister of State or Secretary of the Department.  It does not refer to an inspector as defined under section 3 (1).  No inspector as defined in section 3 (1) of the Bill is being given power to overrule the decision &mdash; I know Deputy Kavanagh will be pleased about this, because he raised the matter previously &mdash; of a harbourmaster to refuse entry of a ship into the harbour under his control.  If one looks at this subsection carefully, it will be noted that only the Minister or a person appointed by him to act on his behalf, for example, a Secretary of the Department or a Minister of State, will be authorised to overrule the harbourmaster's decision.</P>
    <P>Harbourmasters may carry out inspections under section 25 of the Bill.  They are not classified as inspectors because, by virtue of their office, they have a wide range of powers in relation to the harbours they control and could not be defined as inspectors.  The House knows that there is PSC, internationally recognised Port State Control Convention. According to this Paris Convention, inspections are carried out on an ongoing basis on foreign vessels coming into the ports to ensure compliance with several international conventions, including MARPOL, even though MARPOL is not included in our legislation.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is read carefully it can be seen that there is no conflict.  One must keep in mind that the inspectors provided for in section 3 are disjunctive; the inspector is not the same as the person appointed by the Minister under section 23 (2).</P>

      <P>We are going into muddy waters.  The Minister referred me to a part of the legislation that says a person appointed by the Minister, but I refer the Minister to section 21, which very clearly states the powers of an inspector, not those of a person appointed by the Minister.  The definition of an inspector is quite clear.  An inspector is defined as being a surveyor of ships, a person appointed to be an inspector by warrant of the Minister under section 20, or an officer holding a commissioned naval rank in the Defence Forces, or a member of the Garda Síochána.  Section 21 gives that inspector wide sweeping powers.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the Minister's explanation on this issue, because under paragraphs (a) to (i) of section 21 (2) the inspector is given many sweeping powers. I assume that the person to be appointed by the Minister under warrant is one and the same person as the inspector.  That has to be so.  If not, then the inspector would have many more powers than the person appointed under warrant.  Section 21 (2) (g) states than an inspector can &ldquo;at any time, enter any place, whether on land or at sea, and therein inspect any container for the storage, or any apparatus for the transfer to or from a ship, of oil, oily mixtures, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage or garbage&rdquo;.  In all fairness, the person appointed by the Minister has to be the same person as the inspector.  He would be very foolish if we did not take that definition.  Perhaps the person who framed the Bill did not consider the measure in the light that I did, but I have before me a very clear definition of an inspector, the powers of an inspector and the way he can carry out those powers.</P>
      <P>The Minister's motivation is probably correct, I am not disputing that at all, but he has included in the list of those qualified to be inspectors the Garda Síochána.  I must emphasise that I am not against the Garda Síochána, I know that they do tremendous work.  However, this is not the work of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to clarify the position, but I very forcibly refer him to <Col N="508" /> section 21, which clearly spells out the powers of an inspector, and by definition such as inspector could be a garda.  I admit that the person appointed by warrant by the Minister is not specified as an inspector &mdash; I have to admit that because the Minister did outline it for me &mdash; but, on the other side, how does the Minister clarify, the position of an inspector?  That is where the Bill goes adrift.</P>
    <P>It appears that in framing the Bill, the intention was to have a garda provide a back-up service to an inspector if he had to do his duty.  I have to emphasise that all we can go on is what is written in the Bill.  With all due respect to the Minister, it seems the Minister has juggled this issue backwards and forwards.  Section 21 states clearly and categorically what an inspector can do, and according to the Bill an inspector can be a member of the Garda Síochána.  It may be that that was never intended, but I ask the Minister to consider carefully my point that the person appointed by warrant and the inspector is one and the same person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it would be difficult to define a suitably qualified person in the Bill.  In my view, it is necessary that an attempt is made to provide such a definition.  It is important to define the qualities and the requirements of anyone required to do this particularly important job, whether that person be an inspector or someone appointed by warrant.  That is why Members very seriously tell the Minister that under section 3 he could not simply appoint a person without ensuring that he was suitably qualified.  Nor could he simply appoint a member of the Garda Síochána without that garda being suitably qualified.  I do not know whether a bangharda would be accepted for the job, but in any event, neither the gardaí nor the bangharda would be suitably qualified to do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he needed latitude in the Bill because an inspector would have to act speedily.  I should think that <Col N="509" /> the person on the spot who could act the most speedily would be a harbourmaster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy already said that many harbours do not have harbourmasters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, indeed, but I think it would be a good start to include harbourmasters in that definition.  If a harbour has a harbourmaster, then he should be the person appointed as inspector for the area.  That is the point I have been trying to make all the time.  The harbourmaster has all the qualifications for the job which are qualifications listed under section 21, and he is the man on the job.  A harbourmaster could do all the jobs required of an inspector.  I do not know why the Minister is avoiding requests made from this side in that regard.  He should first accept that where there are harbourmasters appointed they should be the people to become inspectors. That would at least clear many of the major ports and would resolve the concerns of the Harbourmasters Association and the Irish Port Authorities Association that somebody may be appointed over the heads of harbourmasters to do the job that they are most qualified to do.  That would go a long way to settle my concerns also.</P>
      <P>There is a harbourmaster in every major port, and they are placed strategically between places that do not have a harbourmaster.  The Minister knows that as well as I do.  One has only to travel around the coast to find that there may be 20 or 30 miles between major harbours &mdash; the distances being perhaps a little longer on the west coast.  Nevertheless, harbourmasters are certainly there and there is quite a number of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could improve the Bill by stating that those harbours that have <Col N="510" /> harbourmasters appointed under the Harbours Act, 1946, will have their harbourmasters appointed as inspectors. The Minister would start off with people who have a fund of knowledge and expertise and he would know he has covered the concerns that Members have been voicing in the House, perhaps for too long, but in the hope that the Minister would take on board that reasonable suggestion from this side of the House, one that makes sense because it is their daily task.  They have to be on call for seven days a week because of the way shipping operates in major ports, and even in the less significant ports.  The Minister would have a group of people who could be relied upon, who would have the knowledge and expertise, and he would only have to be concerned about ports where there are not harbourmasters, ports which would be less likely to have the problems envisaged by the Bill.  In exceptional cases only, would the Minister have to appoint people other than those I have suggested.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kavanagh is a shrewd and experienced Member of this House, but we are here dealing with an amendment about suitably qualified gardaí.  In discussing that it was suggested that a garda would have power to overrule a harbourmaster.  I indicated that that is not so.  We are dealing with a specific amendment.  If Deputy Kavanagh looks at section 25 he will see that a harbourmaster has authority of inspection in his harbour area.</P>

      <P>The amendments <Col N="511" /> do not mention the word &ldquo;garda&rdquo;.  They refer specifically to suitably qualified persons, and to a person with a qualification and expertise in the area.  There are serious defects in the Bill in relation to defining an inspector as a member of the Garda Síochána.  Section 21 refers in detail to the powers of the inspector. Section 22 relates to the defective ship or equipment and it says:</P>
      <P> (1)  Where an inspector determines, having inspected a ship, that the ship or any equipment or fitting thereon&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  does not correspond substantially with the particulars specified in a certificate under section 17 or an equivalent certificate issued by another Party to the MARPOL Convention, or  </P>
      <P>Will someone tell me what member of the Garda Síochána would know anything about the MARPOL Convention not to talk abot the certificate under section 17 of this Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the Department of Justice are extending the training of Garda recruits to such an extent that an ordinary recruit leaving training headquarters would have this type of knowledge.  It is to talk pie in the sky to suggest that under section 22 an ordinary garda would go out to a ship and make this sort of decision.  I agree with Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan that this is a specialised area.  For us to casually suggest that a garda can do the type of work necessary and the necessary testing and come to the conclusions one is expected to come to and have the extensive maritime expertise required by this Bill is asking too much of a regular member of the Garda Síochána.  To leave in the section a provision that an inspector may be a member of the Garda Síochána is ridiculous.  The situation is farcical.  If the Minister had the good sense to take out that bit and put in &ldquo;a harbour master&rdquo; who knows <Col N="512" /> what it is about and knows about shipping it would improve the Bill.  The harbour master is not mentioned except in relation to specific functions in other sections.  He is not classified under the term &ldquo;inspector&rdquo;.  We have a number of harbour masters in the major ports who would have the necessary qualification and expertise to do this work.  My amendment seeks to insert &ldquo;with suitable qualifications and expertise&rdquo;.  Who has more suitable qualifications and expertise than the harbour master?</P>
      <P>The Minister has attempted a good defence of this section and the definition of inspector but the more one analyses this section the more one realises how ridiculous it is.  We must acknowledge that where circumstances arise where a ship must be boarded, every harbour master will not be so busy that he cannot leave down what he is doing in his local harbour and take on the urgent work required in circumstances envisaged under the Bill.  The Minister has not convinced me that this amendment should not be pushed.  The more I hear, the more I realise how defective the section is and how necessary the amendment is.</P>

      <P>That is why it is important that any legislation which goes through here does not give an opening to a harum-scarum Minister of the future to do something of this nature.  It may not happen but we should not provide the opportunity in the legislation to do this. In neither instance to which the Minister <Col N="514" /> referred was the inspector a member of the Garda Síochána.  In both instances the best people were employed and I compliment them on how they acquitted themselves, their work was first class, they were excellent and deserve the full support of this House.  They were suitably qualified people and that is why the legislation should be specific in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister paid me a compliment in regard to how I make use of a debate in this House and I should like to return the compliment.  He implied that we did not have faith in his Department's inspectors; of course we have.  Like the Minister, I have had experience of their work and I hold them in the highest regard.  However, as Deputy Taylor-Quinn said, many gardaí in the areas to which the Minister referred were helpful but they were not inspectors.  The amendment merely asks that &ldquo;a suitably qualified garda&rdquo; should be an inspector.  The Minister would possibly have appointed an inspector in one or both of those areas if he had found a suitably qualified garda.</P>
      <P>It is not outlandish to suggest that the Minister should have gone to Cork for a harbourmaster or &mdash; in the case of Ballyvaughan &mdash; to Galway because he could have sent somebody from Dublin, which would have been quicker.  The Minister had two specialists close to the areas and he did the right thing.  There was an excellent result from the officers concerned. That being the case, that category should be included in the Bill as they are the most suitably qualified people for the job. The Minister is making a mistake in saying that the only people who should be inspectors are those with qualifications.  If the Minister does not accept our amendment it means that the Bill will be flawed because he is not asking for the expertise he believed was necessary when he had a problem on his hands in two areas.</P>

We included the words &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; because we felt the Minister would not change the qualifications under that <Col N="515" /> heading.  Perhaps, on second thoughts, the Minister may eliminate the Garda Síochána from the Bill.  I appreciate that an inspector would have to have Garda back-up and maybe that was on the Minister's mind but we must go on what is in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on what was done in Bantry Bay, it was an excellent job by experts in their field who were in a dangerous position.  The Minister obviously has expertise in this Department. The same applies to Ballyvaughan, they brought the fish down to Cork and it smelled for quite a while but we will not say a word about that.</P>

      <P>I do not want anyone to think we are criticising the Garda Síochána, that is not true.  Has the Minister had consultations with the Garda Commissioner in regard to this issue?  It appears that gardaí are just slotted into a situation over which they have no control.  A garda can enforce the law but we have a difficulty in asking him to become an inspector.  That is why we put in &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo;.  Gardaí do not need to have a college degree, merely to be suitably qualified.  If the Minister had deleted it from the Bill it would have solved everyone's problem.  However, I have to go on the definition in the Bill which very clearly states that a garda can become an inspector.  If the garda is to be involved he must be suitably qualified; if not let us have the experts, including the harbourmaster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7a:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), lines 8 to 10, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;or to any&rdquo; in line 8 down to the end of the subsection and substitute the following &ldquo;in wartime, where pollution occurs from that ship as a result of an assault from an enemy ship, submarine, or aircraft.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Under section 4 warships are exempted from the provisions of the Bill, but it is well known that warships cause major pollution right across the world.  It is possible that most of our sea-going vessels are warships in one form or another, whether they are ships or submarines.  The United States Navy used to throw a great deal of waste into the sea but once the MARPOL convention was introduced which stopped the dumping of plastic, in particular, into the sea, 62 million lbs less litter was thrown into the sea each year.  The level of pollution caused by warships is high and there is no justification for suggesting that warships in our waters from outside our jurisdiction should be exempted from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my amendment I propose that warships come within the provisions of the Bill except in certain circumstances.  In normal circumstances one could not justify a warship being exempt from pollution controls.  Some of these ships carry up to 4,000 people, resulting in food, plastic, garbage, sewage and possibly oil spillages.  There should be an onus on these ships to comply with the MARPOL Regulations, as is the case with all other sea-going vessels.  I do not see why there should be any exception for warships, <Col N="519" /> except in time of war where they are a victim of circumstances.  That is why I have tabled this amendment.  I hope the Minister will see the wisdom of it and accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be opposing section 4 of this Bill.  It is quite a remarkable section, which provides for exemptions for two categories.  It says that &ldquo;The Act shall not apply to any warship or to any ship for the time being used by the government of any country for purposes other than commercial purposes.&rdquo;  The second category exempts ships in situations where the Minister may be regulation exempt any other type of vessel or class of ship registered in the State from complying with the provisions of this Bill. We are dealing with the issue of sea pollution, which is defined in section 3, and &ldquo;garbage&rdquo;, which is defined also, so we know that we are dealing with serious pollution threats.  Frankly, I do not believe there should be any exemptions, because if you start getting into the area of exempting certain types of ships, they may very well be the type of ship that will end up discharging something into the sea and causing a major pollution risk to our coastline and to the sea itself.  If a ship causes pollution or there is a serious discharge of a pollutant from a ship it is going to cause damage to the sea, to the coastline.  Pollution is not going to discriminate between the kind of damage it does to the coastline or to wildlife, or to fish because it happens to be caused by a warship or a ship which the Minister happened to have made regulations exempting it from the terms of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of amendments dealing with this.  Deputy O'Sullivan has tabled one amendment to delete the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; and in another amendment he proposes to delete subsection (2), which is essentially the same as what I propose in opposing the section.  Then we come to deal with Deputy Taylor-Quinn's amendment No. 7a, and quite honestly I do not know where Deputy Taylor-Quinn got the idea for this amendment but in my opinion it makes matters worse.  Her <Col N="520" /> amendment provides that warships can be exempted except in wartime, where pollution occurs from that ship as a result of an assault from an enemy ship, submarine or aircraft&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us think this through. As I understand it, the Minister in his Second Stage reply indicated that one of the reasons for this provision was, not to deal with situations in relation to our own warships &mdash; not that I was aware that we had any &mdash; but that this was included because some of the countries who were a party to MARPOL had large navies and for security reasons and so on did not want inspectors to be able to go on board their ships, look at logs and investigate what they were about.  I do not agree with that kind of logic but I can understand where it is coming from.  We do not have any of these war ships.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn is saying that it is all very well to exempt warships in wartime or where there is an assault on an enemy ship, submarine or aircraft.  In what circumstances does she envisage a warship being assaulted in Irish waters in wartime? Who will come to attack us with a warship or whom will we attack?  I know that Fine Gael made much play recently of neutrality being out of date, but I had not thought they had quite got to the stage where they were about to declare war on somebody.  These would appear to be the circumstances Deputy Taylor-Quinn is trying to provide for in this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated last week at Question Time in reply to a question about submarines in the Irish Sea that there was a serious threat to fishing and passenger vessels as a result of the activities of submarines.  We know that many of these submarines are nuclear powered.  Can we imagine the extent of pollution which would result from an assault on a nuclear powered <Col N="521" /> submarine in the Irish Sea?  It might be assaulted under the exemption allowed for in Deputy Taylor-Quinn's amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not believe Deputy Taylor-Quinn's amendment will resolve the issue we have to consider.  The issue is simple.  There should be no warships in Irish waters nor any ship being used for the time being by the government of another country for purposes other than commercial purposes.</P>
      <P>What exactly is being provided for here?  Perhaps the Minister could indicate the circumstances in which he would envisage making regulations, the type of vessels which would be exempted and when they might be exempted.  Either this Bill will protect our seas and our coastline or it will not.  I should like to know the circumstances in which it would be all right to have pollution.  In what circumstances will we wake up in the morning to discover that there has been a major oil spill causing pollution of the coast or the sea and we will decide it is not too bad because it has come from a warship or a vessel that has been exempted under the Minister's regulations? That would be very poor consolation when dealing with very serious matters of pollution.  This Bill either applies to all ships or it does not.  If we make exemptions, then those exemptions will produce the exception which in turn will produce pollution.</P>

      <P>All ships should come under the law and I cannot understand why naval ships should be exempted.  Naval ships should be the example.  We should be able to frame our own legislation and should not depend on others.  It is one of the weaknesses of the MARPOL agreement that governments who bring in legislation under that agreement are those which have strong naval forces and they have a vested interest in exempting their ships from this type of regulation.  If we are serious about protecting our marine environment we have no option but to allow the law to run its course.  All vessels should come under the legislation.  I cannot understand why governments who are party to the MARPOL agreement exclude naval vessels.</P>
      <P>There are vessels which have polluted our waters out of sight of land.  This country should take a very strong hand on the issue of naval vessels.  It would be ridiculous if a ferry coming into Cork, Rosslare or Dún Laoghaire had to abide by the regulations while a naval vessel would be able to cause pollution coming into the harbour.  It is incredible that that could happen.  I look forward to the Minister's explanation.  It is ridiculous that a Government who are to bring in strict regulations should exempt naval forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the whole section and I am not inclined to support Deputy Taylor-Quinn's rather convoluted amendment.  A much clearer <Col N="523" /> position is to oppose the whole section. The reason for opposing the section have already been made by Deputies Gilmore and O'Sullivan.  Nevertheless there is another point that needs to be made here.</P>
      <P>The Minister is making great play of the fact that the object of this Bill is to ratify the MARPOL Convention 14 years after it should have been ratified, but that is another day's work.  What is MARPOL?  MARPOL is an international treaty voluntarily entered into by about 130 different countries.  Of necessity it is minimalist; it is the lowest common denominator.  It is all that 130 countries could agree and that, as far as I know, has to be by consensus.  In a consensual situation like that one invariably comes out with the lowest common denominator.  Certainly in this respect the MARPOL Convention is seriously flawed and this is another item that should be on the agenda for the Minister as soon as this Bill is enacted. The Minister has an obligation to initiate another MARPOL Convention to improve the original MARPOL Convention in this respect at any rate &mdash; and there may be other areas that need improvement.  There is much unfinished business here.  We all agree there is a large percentage of maritime business in naval vessels or war ships.  The Minister has not made a case.  Let us suppose there was no MARPOL.  I put it to the Minister that we need a sea pollution Bill and there certainly would be no question of any exemption for war ships, if we were starting afresh.  So I have no hesitation in opposing this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate. MARPOL may have had to extend its boundaries to take in some of the other warlike and military armed nations.  Of course we are in a completely different situation and intend, hopefully, to stay that way.  Therefore, when we bring in a sea pollution Bill we should make every effort not to include any exemption from the polluting of our seas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> In fact the military sources of pollution of our oceans are incredibly high.  I understand 163,170,000 lbs. of pollution and garbage is dumped in the oceans each year.  Each crew member in the United States navy generates three pounds of solid waste per day of which up to .2 lbs. is plastic.  Some ships with 5,000 men abroad can generate 1,000 lbs. of plastic trash per day.  We are talking about horrific poundage.  Leaving aside the other waste, that 1,000 lbs. of plastic waste will take maybe 1,000 years to decompose.</P>
    <P>The last thing we need around our shores is naval or war vessels, nor indeed should there ever be any need for them. I am sure there are more crew members on a warship than there are passengers on a cruising passenger ship.  What I am talking about is probably the greatest polluter with garbage and waste, particularly plastic, because if one is catering for 5,000 crew members one will be using many plastic disposables and they take a long time to decompose.</P>
    <P>I want to add my voice to those objecting to the incredible idea of exempting war ships.  If we are bringing in a sea pollution Bill let us make it as strong and as effective as possible and let us set higher standards than those demanded by international conventions.</P>

      <P>We have moved from the amendment to the section.

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Deputy.  We cannot support the amendment and, since my colleague's amendment is regarded as redundant, I just want to give the reasons why.  Article 2 of the MARPOL Convention defines as a vessel of any type whatsoever operating in the maritime environment.  That includes every vessel, warships and so on.  I do not think that under any circumstances the Oireachtas should <Col N="525" /> exclude any ship.  Obviously, the Minister will say we have to adopt the MARPOL Convention as it stands and, therefore, he has to include this section relating to warships.  All we can do is oppose the section and it is pointless going along with the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh quoted article 2 which states that a ship means a vessel of any type whatsoever operating in the maritime environment and includes hydrofoil boats, air cushion vehicles, submersibles, floating craft and fixed or floating platforms.</P>
      <P>Article 3.3, which is relevant to the amendment, states that the convention shall not apply to any warship, naval, auxiliary or other ship owned or operated by a State and used for the time being only on Government non-commercial service; but that each party shall ensure, by the adoption of appropriate measures, not impairing the operations or operational capabilities of such ships owned or operated by it, that such ships act in a manner consistent so far as is reasonable and practicable with the present convention. The present convention is the MARPOL Convention.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give us, with an international setting, as strong an anti-pollution Bill as we possibly can get, as strong an Act as we can put on the Statue Book.  The fact that it is in an international setting adds support and strength to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately for some Deputies, the procedure under international law is as stated in Article 3.3.  No state makes warships subject to domestic legislation but there is the rider in Article 3.3 that I have just read out &mdash; the strong recommendation that even such a ship, whether it is a warship or one used by a government for other than commercial purposes, should see to it that all necessary steps are taken to prevent pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance is between placing our Sea Pollution Bill in the proper international context or introducing our own private Bill when we would not have the international support.  This is germane to the amendment before us.  As we are on one <Col N="526" /> of the busiest laneways from North America to Europe it is necessary to place the Bill in the context of the international law of the sea.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point about Deputy Taylor-Quinn's amendment.  It is important to realise that in international law <i>force majeure</i>&mdash; weather, war etc &mdash; is very important and should be taken cognisance of.  The amendment is not necessary because it is already an internationally accepted principle of maritime law that in cases of <i>force majeure</i> compliance with rules and regulations may be waived.  It is important to note that.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that this amendment has given rise to such debate in the House.  I have been interested in the variety of contributions made so far.  Deputy O'Sullivan dealt with it in the reasonable way he usually adopts.  Deputy Gilmore decided to follow a few hares and became very concerned about warships.  He wondered in what circumstances warships would come into our waters and whether the Fine Gael Party were raising questions of neutrality or Ireland being involved in war. Being what I consider an intelligent, usually practical Deputy, he would, I thought, have seen the common sense of the amendment.</P>
      <P>The section exempts warships or any ship used by a government for business other than commercial purposes.  Being pragmatic and practical we on this side of the House felt that in time of war where ships become victims of circumstances and could cause pollution because of circumstances outside their control, to exempt them would make common sense.  If Deputy Gilmore wants to follow the line he might be pre-empting a debate that will take place in this House in the near future.  We should not put our heads in the sand either since we are a member of the EU striving towards greater political union.  Defence union as an issue will be discussed in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Kavanagh dealt with the section on the MARPOL Convention. Maybe the Labour Party could not justify it but I detected a certain element of fear in relation to warships.  That raises questions certain Members might be afraid to address, but we as a party are pragmatic and realistic and can face up to problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Garland thought the amendment convoluted.  I fail to understand where the convolution arises.  The amendment is straightforward and deals practically with a situation.  We do not believe warships should be exempt from this Bill.  We believe they should be exempted only where they are victims of war, are attacked and pollution occurs. In normal circumstances I do not see why <Col N="528" /> naval vessels should be exempt from the rules and regulations that apply to all other seagoing vessels around Irish waters or why they should not have to comply with the same rules and regulations as the ordinary civilian operator when they dock at our various ports to dispose of their garbage.  To exempt them is wrong.  In every instance the arm of government should set the example to the civilian operator.  Exemption is unacceptable. I ask the Minister to reconsider this amendment.  It is practical and deserves support and I am happy it has generated a certain amount of debate in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The civil legal aid scheme assists those who cannot afford a private solicitor and gives them proper access to the courts.  As you are aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Minister for Justice recently announced he was expanding the civil legal aid scheme.  New centres are to be opened in Castlebar, Dundalk and Letterkenny.  Two new centres are to be opened in Dublin &mdash; one in Clondalkin and another in the Finglas-Ballymun area.  I welcome the opening of these new centres but I am concerned about the Minister's announcement that the centre at Aston Quay in Dublin is to be closed.  Aston Quay is in my own constituency and it was the first civil legal aid centre in Dublin to be established in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present Aston House has four solicitors. It is intended that the two new Dublin centres will have two solicitors each.  In effect what the Minister proposes is to divide Aston House in two. There will, therefore, be no expansion of the civil legal aid scheme in the Dublin area.  The Family Lawyers Association commend the opening of the new centres in urban areas and have recommended to the Minister that further centres should be opened in large population areas such as Ballymun and Clondalkin.  However, the demand for legal aid services in Dublin is such that the two new centres should be in addition to those presently available.  At present, there are four centres in Dublin &mdash; Ormond Quay, Gardiner Street, Tallaght and Aston House. The situation as of today's date is as follows: Ormond Quay &mdash; new clients are being told to contact the centre again in six weeks time.  The centre is not even taking the names and addresses of new clients as the waiting list is so long that the centre cannot predict when it will be in a position to take on new clients; <Col N="531" /> Gardiner Street &mdash; names and addresses of new clients are being taken but they are being advised that it will be at least five months before they can expect an appointment; Tallaght &mdash; names and addresses of new clients are being taken but it is not possible to indicate when an appointment will be available; and Aston Quay &mdash; this centre, which the motion is about, has been closed to new clients for some time now due to the backlog of clients awaiting appointments.</P>
    <P>As you can see from what I have said, the demand for services in the Dublin area is such that new centres need to be opened but not at the expense of the closure of other centres.  Contrary to the Minister's statement the opening of two new centres is not an expansion of the scheme but merely a rearrangement of the existing services.</P>
    <P>There are other difficulties which arise in the closure of a city centre.  The Dublin centres take on clients from any part of Ireland where there is not a centre already in existence.  Being in the centre of Dublin the offices which I have listed are generally accessible to clients as they are situated near the main bus routes.  If a wife is represented by one centre the husband will have to seek legal aid in another centre due to the possible conflict of interest that can arise.  It is not possible for a husband and wife to be represented by the same centre.  The opening of centres in Clondalkin and Ballymun, will not, therefore, solve the problems for those areas as the other spouse will still have to seek legal aid outside that area.</P>
    <P>At present demand exceeds the ability of the scheme to provide services.  There are literally hundreds of low income people on the waiting lists, not to mention those who are not even getting on waiting lists.  Seven members of the legal aid board have resigned, among them Mr. Niall Fennelly, chairman of the Bar Council.  They resigned in the hope that the service would be improved and to highlight the need for an increase in the services, but, unfortunately, the services are not improved.  For the Government to suggest closing a centre when none of <Col N="532" /> the Dublin centres are open to new clients is, to say the very least, an insult to those who require legal advice and who do not have sufficient income to pay for it.</P>
    <P>It is my considered opinion that the Government in failing to provide an adequate scheme of civil legal aid are in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision on the closure of Aston House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the 1977 Report of the Pringle Committee on Civil Legal Aid, was being considered prior to the establishment of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice it was decided, in 1980, following a recommendation in that report, that law centres should be established in central locations, which would be readily accessible to persons, wishing to avail themselves of the new service. For that reason, and particularly in so far as Dublin was concerned, the preference was for city centre locations.  That is why the two initial centres were situated at Gardiner Street and Aston House in 1980.  Precisely the same consideration applied to the opening of the Ormond Quay Law Centre in 1982.</P>
      <P>For some time now, the Legal Aid Board, has been considering the rationalisation of the service, provided in Dublin by the closure of the law centre at Aston House, and the redeployment of the staff to two new law centres to be opened in the suburbs of the city.  I want to stress that the initiative in this matter came from the Legal Aid Board themselves. Under the scheme, the location and establishment of law centres is a matter for the board, subject only to the consent of the Minister for Justice.  I will return to this aspect of the matter in a moment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the proposed move is to make the service provided by the board under the scheme more accessible to persons residing in the very large housing areas that have developed at the periphery of the city and who are put to considerable expense and inconvenience in having to travel to city centre offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> It is clear that population shifts of this nature, within the wider context of urban planning give cause for a rethink on earlier decisions on the location of law centres in an area as large as Dublin.  It was against this background that a law centre was opened in Tallaght in 1987 rather than at a location in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>The question of the opening of new full-time and part-time law centres is dealt with in part 6 of the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice.  Section 6.2 stipulates that in deciding where law centres should be located the board must have regard to certain matters, such as the desirability of providing, so far as possible, ready access to legal services in areas where the need for those services is at it greatest and the need to use available resources in a way likely to result in maximum benefit for persons in need of legal services.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provision of paragraph 2.2.2 of the scheme, the consent of the Minister for Justice is required for the opening of new law full-time centres by the board.  Following the recent allocation of increased funding by the Minister for Justice to enable additional law centres to be opened, the board submitted proposals, which included the closure of the Aston House Law Centre and the opening of two new law centres at Clondalkin and in the Ballymun-Finglas area.  The Minister for Justice consented to these proposals as well as to the board's proposals to open new law centres at Letterkenny, Dundalk and Castlebar. The establishment of these two new Dublin law centres will facilitate the opening of part-time law centres at other suburban locations and the board have already identified Blanchardstown and Balbriggan as the locations for such centres. Under paragraph 6.2.3 of the scheme, part-time law centres can be opened by the board without reference to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I think that anyone who considers the situation for a moment will agree that the board's proposals in this matter make perfect sense.  It must be a daunting prospect for anyone living in the areas which will be served by the new Dublin law <Col N="534" /> centres to have to mount an expedition into the city centre to avail themselves of legals services under the scheme.  Furthermore, the change is totally in keeping with one of the central features of the Pringle Committee's report regarding the development of a community based legal aid service.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is one further reason for the closure of the Aston House Law Centre, it is, that the board's lease on the premises is almost expired.  This affords the opportunity of making the change that the board desire at this time.</P>
    <P>I trust that this information puts the matter in context for Deputy Doyle and indeed for the House.  I am certain that the House will agree that the Minister for Justice, the Department of Justice and the Government are expanding this scheme very broadly indeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this most important matter.  I am sure everybody in the House would join with me in saying we were all horrified to read in the Sunday newspapers about the appalling damage and destruction caused as a result of vandals setting fire to seven cars and a minibus, all of which were parked in driveways. Since many of these houses have no garages, the excuse that these vehicles should be parked in garages does not apply.  Ten days earler a truck and a motorbike were destroyed by fire in the same area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Families living in these areas in whose driveways these fires took place had to vacate their homes with their children in case rows of houses were set on fire.  It is the mercy of God that there was no loss of life.  These acts of vandalism have left families in the area living in fear.  As will be noted from newspaper reports, people are afraid to give their names because of gangs of youths marauding in the area causing untold damage and instilling great fear in many people.  In one house there was a neighbourhood watch sign <Col N="535" /> in the window and stones were thrown through the window to deter people from displaying the neighbourhood watch sign, in an attempt to break up that worthwhile scheme.</P>
    <P>The real danger here is that people will take the law into their own hands unless the Garda are given support to tackle these outrageous attacks on ordinary people, many of whom have high mortgages and rents to pay &mdash; some of the houses in question are owned by Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  Most of the people are repaying car loans.  In one instance a man with his own small painting and contracting business was left without his tool and his van which meant he was put out of business.  This is not an isolated case.  If it were I am sure the Minister would tell us that the Garda are investigating the incident and will try to bring those responsible to justice.</P>
    <P>In recent months there has been gang warfare in the area, there have been numerous house break-ins, smashing of windows and assaults on young people walking the streets.  In one incident these people ran through Killiney village smashing the windows of every car, local shop and people's houses.  We read reports regularly in the newspapers in which the district justice in Dún Laoghaire is quoted as saying he is frustrated having to allow out on bail young persons who have numerous charges against them because there are not sufficient detention centres in which to detain them.  We have heard statements that provision is to be made for these centres, but in the meantime these people are running riot. Young teenagers and children are out until all hours of the morning.  The vandalism I am talking about was caused between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. last Sunday. There are no legislative proposals to change our laws to make parents responsible for the damage caused by their children. They should not allow their children to go out in the early hours of the morning and get involved in this sort of thuggery.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to give a positive response that he intends to change <Col N="536" /> the law and provide additional gardaí to this area to deal with the people who carry out these acts of vandalism and destruction.  If that is not done, the people could take the law into their own hands, and none of us would condone that.  Cabinteely Garda station is responsible for most of the area where this damage has been caused.  In 1987 there were 36 gardaí in Cabinteely station, in 1988 there were 38, in 1989 there were 33 and in 1990 there were 31.  That Garda station has lost seven gardaí since 1988. When you divide the number of gardaí there by four &mdash; there are three shifts and a rest shift &mdash; there are fewer than eight gardaí in this station at any one time. Taking into account special duties the gardaí have to perform, minding various dignatories in the area as well as manning the station, there is literally nobody to go on the beat in this area.  It is no wonder we have this problem.  We also read in our newspapers recently of the drug problem in this area.  When the Garda moved in to try to solve the problem they were attacked by pit bull terriers.  I do not know what will happen if the assistance that is urgently needed to tackle this problem is not given before it literally gets totally out of control.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of a football club who are looking after 13 teams and trying to do something for the youth of the area. It costs that club about £11,000 a year to meet their expenses, which include transport, insurance on the building and so on.  The club provide a wonderful service and they receive no money except through raffles, etc.  The national lottery has dried up a lot of the money that was available for local draws.  In addition to providing extra Garda strength in the area and introducing laws to tackle these problems I would ask the Minister to make representations to the Minister who is sitting near him that national lottery funds be given to those clubs, not only to clubs in those areas, particularly in Dublin, who are providing a wonderful social service for all.  Some recognition at least should be given so that they can meet their day-to-day expenses.  Small sums can go a long way.</P>

      <P>I would not like to meander into the realm of the responsibilities of another Minister's affairs, but I did not think national lottery funding was available for the running costs of any organisation; I thought it was for development projects and expenditure such as that.  Deputy Barrett played a key role in the introduction of national lottery legislation and I am sure no one knows that fact better than him.</P>

      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concern at the appalling incidents which occured in Ballybrack and Killiney area in the early hours of Saturday last.  I would like to take this opportunity to extend our sympathy to the victims of those incidents and to assure tham that this type of mindless vandalism to the property of hard-working citizens will not be tolerated in our society.  The Garda authorities are also concerned at the seriousness of these incidents and are determined that everything possible will be done to ensure that the perpetrators of these acts will be apprehended as quickly as possible and brought to face the full rigors of the law.  I assure the House that they will have my full support in this respect.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the residents of Ballybrack and Killiney will want to be assured that this type of incident is not repeated.  The Garda authorities are taking all the necessary steps to prevent a recurrence and additional patrolling in the area has been arranged as a preventive measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This area also receives attention from foot and mobile patrols from the Shankill and Cabinteely stations, which Deputy Barrett referred to.  The crime task force patrol has recently been assigned to augment patrols by the local gardaí.  The area in question has two juvenile liaison officers and is also well served by the Community policing scheme.  An additional community garda has recently been assigned to the area, bringing the <Col N="538" /> total number of Community gardaí alone in the Ballybrack/Killiney area to three. An additional garda will also be assigned shortly to Cabinteely station and appointments have been made to that station recently.  There is a number of very effective neighbourhood watch schemes in operation in Ballybrack and a very high level of co-operation is maintained between the representatives of the scheme and the local gardaí.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that their resources are adequate to deal with crime and vandalism in the area and that they are taking appropriate and effective action in this respect.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, vitally important to remember that the problem of crime and vandalism cannot be dealt with by the gardaí alone &mdash; they need the assistance and support of the local community.  I am aware that the people of Ballybrack give assistance in a wholehearted and committed manner through the neighbourhood watch schemes and in their every day dealings with the gardaí.  I welcome and, indeed, encourage such support. However, I am concerned at media reports of vigilante type action in the area.  Assistance from the public to fight crime must be within the law and must have due regard for the rights of all citizens. The potential dangers inherent in any self-appointed vigilante type group becoming involved in the very sensitive area of crime prevention and law-enforcement are all too obvious.  I must make it clear that any attempts by individual groups to take the law into their own hands will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I would, however, encourage residents who wish to assist the gardaí to prevent crime to do so, through their neighbourhood watch schemes.  I assure the residents that their local Garda representatives will be delighted to have their support and will be only too pleased to meet and discuss with them the problems of the area.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the situation in Ballybrack is being monitored closely and any further action which may prove necessary to deal <Col N="539" /> with the problems created by these vandals will be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the issue of the tolling of the Dublin Ring Road.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to come clean with the people of County Dublin: will he or will he not place a toll on the Dublin Ring Road, which has now been constructed?  All of the indications are that we will place a toll on that road.</P>
      <P>In early 1989 the Minister for the Environment advertised for tenders for the tolling of the Dublin Ring Road and, subsequently, awarded a contract to an American company.  The issue of the tolling of the Dublin Ring Road came to a head last summer when, under the Minister's instructions, toll booths were erected on the road, which was then under construction.  When Dublin County Council found out about that they took a decision ordering the removal of the toll booths at a cost that the Minister admitted to be £50,000 and for which he told the House he took responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weeks ago in the House I asked the Minister how much money had been paid in connection with the tolling of the Dublin Ring Road.  I was astonished when the Minister told me that £2.3 million of taxpayers money had already been <Col N="540" /> paid out in that regard.  I then asked another question, which was answered last week, about what that money had been spent on.  The Minister informed me that it related to the lengthening of the ramps at the Naas interchange with the Dublin Ring Road to provide for toll booth areas together with the necessary queueing areas while still maintaining the acceleration link from toll booth to entry to the motorway necessary for safe merging of sliproad and motorway traffic and the provision of concrete aprons with service connections and toll booth bases in the immediate toll plaza areas.</P>
    <P>Under existing law Dublin County Council are the only body who can decide to place a toll on the Western Ring Road, and I ask why almost £2.5 million of taxpayers' money was paid to do something that the competent authority, Dublin County Council, had decided should not be done.  On whose authority did the Minister spend that enormous amount of taxpayers' money?  The roads of this country are full of potholes and many of the roads are in great need of repair, yet the Minister is prepared to spend almost £2.5 million of taxpayers' money for which he did not have authority from the county council.  The managing director of a private company would be fired if he did something of that nature without the authority of his board of directors or some other authority.  I should like to hear the Minister's explanation for spending that amount of money.</P>
    <P>The second question to which I should like a clear answer from the Minister concerns his intentions in relation to tolling. It is known that the only body who stand between the people of Dublin and tolls on the Western Ring Road are Dublin County Council, the competent authority at the moment.  However, it is also known that under the roads Bill introduced by the Minister he intends to take that authority from the county and give it to the National Roads Authority. I should like to know before the local elections, whether the Minister intends to have tolls in addition to the toll already <Col N="541" /> there.  Does he intend to toll the remainder of the Western Ring Road?  This evening I should like to hear a clear, unequivocal answer to that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal specifically with the points raised by the Deputy I want to put the issue in its proper context.  A brief review of the background is essential to a proper understanding of this topic.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy of successive Governments, and successive Governments representative of the main parties in the House, to encourage toll based private investment in roads to accelerate the development of the road network. That position was outlined initially in the road development plan for the eighties which was published in 1979, and has been repeated several times since, particularly in roads plans published in 1985 and 1989 and in the recent operational programme on peripherality.  In the light of that longstanding policy, my Department engaged consultants in June 1988 to report on the possibility of further tolling of the Dublin Ring Road.</P>
      <P>A toll agreement had already been signed on the west link.  The consultants concluded further tolling could be expected to generate substantial private investment.  Based on the experience gained in the negotiations on the east link and the west link toll franchise agreements, it was decided that the most expeditious and effective way to make progress was for the Department of the Environment to take a lead role in the invitation of proposals and for a steering committee representative of the Departments of Finance and the Environment and Dublin County Council to assess proposals and conduct the subsequent negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1989 private investors were invited by public advertisement to submit proposals for a toll franchise for the Dublin Ring Road.  I must stress that the advertisement and detailed brief to interested parties were provided to Dublin County Council in advance and <Col N="542" /> the advertisement, and the accompanying press statement, made it clear that the invitation was being issued without prejudice to the relevant statutory procedures.</P>
    <P>On foot of a recommendation from the Steering Committee, the Government decided that, subject to the statutory procedures, negotiations in relation to the toll franchise should be undertaken on an exclusive basis with one of the proposers &mdash; a consortium led by Manufactures Hanover Ltd. a US bank and including Cofiroute, a French private toll road operator.  This decision was formally notified to the county council in September 1989 by my Department.  The Department's letter was considered and noted by the three committees of the council in October-November 1989 and there was no indication to my Department that there was any objection to the course being pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  There were several communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>During the negotiations with the chosen consortium certain adjustments were identified as necessary to the ramps being constructed on the Western Parkway so as to permit tolling. The road works in question &mdash; the lengthening of ramps and the provision of concrete aprons and bases for toll booths &mdash; were designed to provide an adequate area for toll facilities while maintaining sufficient acceleration length for entry to the motorway.</P>
      <P>The works did not involve the provision of toll booths or toll equipment. The works were undertaken as part of the construction contract for the Western Parkway as this was clearly the most cost-effective approach.  If they had been undertaken at some stage after the road was open to traffic it would have cost substantially more and would have involved road closures and traffic disruption. No doubt I would have been criticised at that time for not having had the foresight to carry out these works when the road was being built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the specific point raised by <Col N="543" /> the Deputy, I want to strongly refute the suggestion that there was no authority for the expenditure of the £2.3 million on the roadworks to facilitate tolling.  Dublin County Council, as a road authority, have ample statutory authority to undertake roadworks, which these were and I as Minister am empowered to pay grants in respect of such works.  The decision to proceed with the works was in keeping with the principle of reasonable advance provision common to major infrastructure projects.</P>

It was only some months later &mdash; in October 1990 &mdash; that the council passed a resolution objecting to tolls on the Western Parkway.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs respond to the report that the British Ministry of Defence have dumped in the Irish Sea munitions which are being washed ashore along the east coast of Ireland?  The Irish Sea has become in effect an international laundry basket for all sorts of toxic nuclear waste.  Nuclear waste is pumped into the waters, and transported across the Irish Sea at great risk to the Irish public, and there is also a movement of nuclear submarines threatening the lives of Irish fishermen. If the reports of this new development are true I cannot understand why the British authorities show such a blatant and offensive disregard for the natural <Col N="544" /> environment and such blatant disrespect for the sea between the two countries.  It is time to cry &ldquo;halt.&rdquo;  This matter should be raised at the highest level with the British Government and we should receive answers.  There is too much secrecy surrounding the dumping of nuclear waste and the presence of nuclear submarines in the Irish Sea.  These reports should be taken up with the British Government and the waters cleared once and for all.</P>

The report suggests that the munitions originated in Beaufort Dyke, an area reportedly used by the British Ministry of Defence as a repository for World War II munitions.</P>
      <P>We have noted the reported statement by the British Ministry of Defence that care is taken to dump only material that is safe and that will not do any environmental harm.  The Government will seek clarification of the report from the British authorities with the aim of ensuring that any dumping that may be taking place in the Irish Sea will be thoroughly monitored so as to give satisfactory reassurances in regard to its environmental safety, which includes of course reassurance that it poses no threat to life or limb.</P>

      <P>The democratic world today welcomes the news that agreement has been reached on a transitional government for Ethiopia, negotiated at peace talks in London, following the departure of President Menghistu last week.  We hope and pray that 30 years of civil war and devastation will now come to an end and that the international community will genuinely help this proud country to restore itself.  I wish the interim leader Mr. Meless Zenawi, head of the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary <Col N="545" /> Democratic Front good fortune and success in bringing peace and stability and, above all, democracy to his country.</P>
      <P>Ethiopia has been ravaged by drought and famine.  Millions have died over the last ten years or more, from starvation. We know that at least another 5.6 million people are threatened unless food and other assistance gets to them.  We will see a disaster bigger than the 1984-85 famine if assistance is not forthcoming.  I welcome the EC announcement this week that more food aid will be made available in the Horn of Africa particularly to Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia where 15 million are at risk.  There should not be any more excuses about difficulties of transport red tape and bureaucracy.  With the change of regime in Ethiopia and the excellent Irish and other international agencies working there, the developed world should be able to give up their excuses, stop hiding behind them and make an effort to bring aid to all the people who had been cut off because of the fighting, so as to keep them alive and then to provide sustainable long term development to these ancient and proud peoples.  Agencies working there already include Concern, Trócaire, and Self Help from Carlow who have been working quietly to grow Irish potatoes and to develop afforestation projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been following with great interest the developments in Ethiopia which culminated in the capture of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa by the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front, and in London where a framework agreement has been concluded between many of the parties who were involved in the civil war.</P>
      <P>We look forward to the proposed follow up conference to be held in June as outlined in the agreement reached yesterday. This is to discuss the formation of a broadly based provisional government. These are uncertain times but we hope it will be possible to obtain a just and lasting peace settlement in Ethiopia despite the difficulties that undoubtedly lie ahead and which will have to be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to emergency relief for <Col N="546" /> those threatened by famine, I assure the House that Irish and EC responsibilities are, of course, unchanged by these political upheavels.  Emergency relief is provided without reference to the political situation and this will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>The Government have contributed consistently and generously towards the emergency famine relief operation in Ethiopia.  In addition to their contribution through the EC budget, since January 1990 allocations from the disaster relief fund totalling £860,000 have been provided to Irish and international relief agencies.  This includes £325,000 which was the Irish bilateral share of the new Community special aid package for Africa.  This is being channelled through Concern and Trócaire for their feeding operations in southern and western parts of the country where there are serious levels of malnutrition.</P>
    <P>According to the latest information available to me, the new developments in Ethiopia have partially interrupted the relief operation.  However, the south-north operation from the Port of Assab, disrupted for a number of days, has now resumed.  It appears that the route from the Port of Massawa across to Eritrea has actually improved due to the changes security situation and the reduction of military intervention.</P>
    <P>Discussions are already taking place between donors involved in the relief operation and the new administration in Ethiopia which has declared its intention to support the international relief effort.</P>
    <P>In relation to a suggestion made by Deputy Owen in the House, I raised the question of a visit, at a fairly senior level, to the Horn of Africa.  This was at the development council last Monday and I am glad to be able to inform the House that the delegation, which will consist of Ministers of Luxembourg, Italy and the Netherlands, will visit the area in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clear the way so that the American, about whom I wish to raise this issue, will get the Irish passport to which he has been entitled since 1987.  The man first wrote to me from New York on 3 May 1990 after reading in the American newspapers that I had raised the issue of many New Yorkers who had applied in 1986 for Irish citizenship. He read that I had got nowhere in the Dáil with the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>He told me that he had made a proper and valid application under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, and had hoped he would proudly hold his new passport in 1987.  Since then he &mdash; and a further 2,000 people from New York entitled to Irish passports &mdash; have been ignored by the Government.  All that is required is a small amendment to the Act which did not allow those who had made their application, but had not been registered before 31 December 1986, to be registered.</P>
      <P>I now ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to intervene with the Minister for Justice and to indicate to him the embarrassment this is causing to our many friends in America.  Already, the Congressional Friends of Ireland group have raised this issue and a Congressman, Ray McGrath, has reminded people of the many times Americans have helped Irish citizens there.  The Minister should take decisive action and allow this man, with honour and pride, to carry his Irish passport.</P>

      <P>However, I am aware of the problem to which Deputy Owen alluded.  As the Deputy knows, it involves the amendment of the law on citizenship which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice. As she rightly said, that comes from the 1986 Act which made conditions stricter.</P>
      <P>I have raised this matter with the Minister for Justice and I understand he is actively considering it.  I will also convey the remarks of Deputy Owen and Deputy Deenihan to him.</P>

      <P>During the early part of 1990, there were numerous press conferences, launches and publicity ventures announcing the various allocations by different Ministers from the £2.7 billion Structural Funds.  Day after day in the newspapers for weeks one Minister or another was telling us how much this country would gain from the funds. Where are all these moneys now?  Where are the promised projects and the jobs which were to have been created in spending this money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national monitoring committee and the eight regional sub-committees <Col N="549" /> seem to have melted into the background, or perhaps they disappeared into one of the potholes.  I do not think they wanted to disappear or melt into the background but the heavy hand of the Department has clamped down on them and they cannot work.  For example, the Dublin regional sub-committee, made up of public and private members, chambers of commerce and all the social partners, were promised a computer print-out of the 1990 project by April of this year but they have not received it.  A programme has not been drawn up to spend any money in 1991.  We must get our act together in relation to the spending of these Structural Funds before the EC tells us that we are breaking the rules and take the money back.  Get rid of the PR job and implement the programme on which we should be spending this money.</P>

      <P>No operational plan for Dublin has been approved by the EC.  The Community Support Framework for Ireland for 1989-93 was adopted in October 1989 and represents the European Commission's response to the Government's development priorities set out in the national development plan submitted in March of the same year.</P>
      <P>The Community Support Framework is being implemented through 12 operational programmes, a small number of previously approved programmes and a number of parallel measures under the EAGGF Guidance Fund which has Community wide application.  These programmes are sectoral in nature and are national.  The Community Support Framework for Ireland does, however, provide for seven sub-regional review committees which are to be regularly informed and consulted concerning implementation of the operational programmes in the various sub-regions.  They are to meet not less than twice a year to receive and consider progress reports and financial statements on current and planned implementation of measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November and early December last <Col N="550" /> year the seven sub-regional review committees were provided with the first summary statement of structural expenditure in each of the sub-regions.  This covered the outturn for 1989, the forecast for 1990 and a combined forecast for 1991-93, all broken down by operational programmes. Copies of the breakdown were placed in the Dáil Library.  Similar tables showing the outturn for 1989, the outturn again forecast for 1990 and individual forecasts for the year 1991-93 are at an advanced state of preparation in the Department of Finance and will be circulated to all the sub-regional review committees in a matter of days.  Copies will also be placed in the Dáil Library.  It was never intended that the monitoring system for the Community Support Framework at sub-regional level would provide data below sub-regional level.  A breakdown of expenditure between the local authority areas in the Dublin subregion is, therefore, not available.  The sub-regions chosen for the preparation of the National Development Plan were accepted as the appropriate regions for the Community Support Framework and information in a considerable volume of detail is being provided at this level.</P>
    <P>The sub-regional review committees were convened in July 1990 and all have met on a number of occasions since then.</P>
    <P>The committees have already been provided with: (i) detailed reports on the implementation of each of the operational programmes in their sub-regions; and (ii) an overall summary statement of structural spending in each of the sub-regions, circulated in November-early December 1990.</P>
    <P>They have also had detailed presentations made to them by the lead Government Departments and principal implementing agencies concerned with the operational programmes.</P>
    <P>This year, progress reports have been circulated on the following programmes: industry and services, human resources, sanitary services and tourism.</P>
    <P>Progress reports on the remaining operational programmes will be circulated shortly.  These reports, financial statements and presentations show <Col N="551" /> clearly the rate of implementation of each operational programme in each of the sub-regions concerned.</P>
    <P>I trust this information will be of some assistance to the Deputy who does not appear to have any knowledge of the progress which has been made to date.</P>

      <P>During the years the practice of &ldquo;lamping&rdquo;&mdash; the use of high powered lights at night to seek out foxes &mdash; had grown up in rural Ireland.  What happens is that someone holds a light out of the side window of cars, vans or pickup trucks as the vehicle moves slowly along country roads and laneways.  The fox is dazzled by the light and shot.  While I support the culling of vermin and foxes which wreak havoc during the lambing season, it is not safe to use shot guns, .22 rifles or high velocity weapons at night. Increasingly cattle, sheep and other animals have been shot.  In some instances guns have been discharged from positions <Col N="552" /> in close proximity to houses in the dead of the night.  It is a miracle that no one has been shot to date but it may be only a matter of time before someone is. There is an urgent need therefore to introduce guidelines and rules and regulations on the use of these guns.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is an apparent anomaly in the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, whereby an employee who would not normally be expected to work on a public holiday still benefits from that public holiday.  However, this anomaly can arise both in the case of part-time and full-time employees, although I do accept that it is more likely to arise in the case of part-time employees.</P>
      <P>The provision was originally intended to ensure that employers could not reschedule an employee's working hours so that they would not benefit from a public holiday and, accordingly, it still has some merit.  However, because it does give rise to some anomalous situations, I will have it looked at in the context of the proposed review of the Holidays (Employees) Act which is part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>Qualified majority voting is already in operation in relation to occupational safety and health, which accounts for a <Col N="375" /> substantial number of the measures included in the Commission's Action Programme to implement the European Social Charter.</P>
      <P>In the current negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union, there are various proposals for changes in the decision-making machinery in the social policy area, not merely in relation to the implementation of the European Social Charter but for social policy issues generally in the future. These include different formulae for the extension of qualified majority voting, covering such aspects as scope, methods of application, etc.  Because of both the immediate and longer-term implications, all of these proposals require the most careful consideration.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government's general approach to the question of extended qualified majority voting was explained by the Taoiseach in his reply to Dáil Question No. 2 of 8 May 1991, that is, briefly, that the issue must be considered on a case by case basis, but that the Government are favourably disposed in principle to the extension of qualified majority voting subject to important national considerations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, while the IGC discussions are in progress, it would not be helpful to the Irish negotiating position for me to indicate in detail our attitude to the question of extended qualified majority voting in the social policy area and to the various proposals in that regard which are at present under examination.  Our general approach is and will continue to be a constructive one based on our commitment to the achievement of social progress in the Community, while ensuring that important national interests are safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overriding concern for us in relation to Community social policy will be to ensure as best we can that absolute priority is given to the preservation and development of employment.  Indeed, we have been pressing very strongly that this should be reflected as the primary objective in any amended provisions of the social policy chapter of the Treaty.  We <Col N="376" /> will also try to ensure that any changes in Treaty social policy provisions will enable full regard to be had to the circumstances and concerns of smaller Community member states.  This applies to the extension of qualified majority voting and to other Treaty amendments that may be proposed in the social policy area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The recent increase in the level of unemployment among under 25s can be attributed to a combination of factors.</P>
      <P>The number of new extrants to the labour force continues to exceed the number retiring from the labour market. There has been a sharp fall in the numbers emigrating to the United Kingdom and the United States due to the downturn in these economies.</P>
      <P>In addition there has been a significant increase in the numbers returning from abroad due to the deterioration in the employment situation in several countries. It is clear from these developments that the increase in unemployment is not unique to this country but is part of a more global trend.</P>
      <P>However, a major strength in our case is that the economy is well poised to capitalise on the pick-up in world trade which is becoming evident of late after the disruption and temporary lack of confidence caused by the Gulf crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> Both the ESRI and the OECD have fully endorsed the present strategy, as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, for revitalising the economy and stimulating job-creation which is the only solution to the recent unwelcome increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>At the same time, FÁS CERT and the education authorities will continue to offer a wide range of training, work experience and further education programmes for under 25's interested in improving their skill and educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>The Youthreach programme which is specifically geared to low-achievers offers places for up to two years on a combination of education, training and work experience courses.  In addition, FÁS operate a variety of programmes designed to improve employment opportunities for women.</P>
    <P>The success of Government measures to assist young people under 25 gain a foothold in the labour market has been borne out repeatedly by the results of the school leavers surveys.  The latest survey, carried out in 1990, showed that unemployment among school leavers was at its lowest level since 1980.</P>
    <P>The survey underlines the importance of educational qualifications in determining job prospects: one year after leaving school, 30 per cent of these who had left without qualifications were still seeking their first job compared with 18.5 per cent of those who left after completing the intermediate or group certificate and 6.9 per cent of leaving certificate students.</P>
    <P>I shall continue to keep the trends in unemployment under review, in the context of the Exchequer situation and the funding provided under the Community Support Framework, to see whether any adjustments might be needed.</P>

      <P>The position is that reports of important decisions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal were prepared and published in respect of the early years of operation of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  I understand that, while the intention had been to continue with such reports, this, in fact, did not happen because of more pressing demands on the resources of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The reality today is that important decisions of the tribunal are widely publicised either in the media or in specialist publications like <i>Industrial Relations News.</i>  The previous reports which were prepared did not sell well and, therefore, were little used.</P>

      <P>The primary aim of Government policy is to facilitate the creation of full-time employment.  I recognise that work sharing measures could make a contribution towards the expansion of employment so as to reduce unemployment.</P>
      <P>It is clear that new, flexible patterns of work are evolving and that for certain groups, the expansion of part-time and temporary employment, alternative working arrangements, reduced working time, flexible working hours, and job sharing offer many advantages.  The adoption of such practices can also contribute to the more efficient functioning of the labour market.</P>
      <P>The increased use of work-sharing as a way of distributing employment is primarily a matter for negotiation between employers and worker representatives or individual employees.</P>

Joint EC/EFTA ministerial meetings have been held periodically to review progress and to consider outstanding issues.  The most recent such meeting was held in Brussels on 13 May.</P>

Switzerland did not issue any separate statement.  A copy of the joint declaration has been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>In their joint declaration the Community and EFTA Ministers confirmed their commitment to conclude the negotiations before the summer.  They noted that agreement had been achieved on several important elements of the EEA Agreement and concluded that solutions now seemed possible on the remaining issues.

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to media reports which allege that transactions involving Irish banks were improperly monitored by foreign intelligence services.

      <Quest>if he will outline having regard to his predecessors reply to Parliamentary Question No. 61 of 28 October 1987 concerning the Top Level Appointments Commission (1) its present composition, (2) in relation to the posts of (a) secretary, (b) second secretary, (c) deputy secretary, (d) assistant secretary and (e) a departmental or technical equivalent who were appointed under the TLAC system or otherwise as at 22 May 1991, the name, date of appointment, the Department or office in which they are currently serving and the projected date of retirement on the basis of contract or age, (3) the present method of appointment under this procedure, (4) the number of officers at No. (2) above who are remunerated on a performance basis and (5) the number of appointments made by grade and Department or office in each year between 1987 and 1991; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to part (1) of the question is as follows: Chairman: Mr. D. Nally, Secretary to the Government, <i>ex-officio</i> member; Members: Mr. K. Murphy, Secretary, Public Service Management and Development, Department of Finance, <i>ex-officio</i> member; Mr. E. McCumiskey, Secretary, Department of Social Welfare, for a term of three years; Mr. C. Mac Domhnaill, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, for a term of three years.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has indicated that he has under consideration the appointment of a woman to be a member of the committee.</P>
      <P>The answer to part (3) of the question is that there has been no change in the method of appointment of civil servants who come within the ambit of the committee. Secretaries of Departments are appointed for a term of seven years and on the basis of retirement at age 60 or, in certain cases, five years after their appointment, if this is later.  Appointments to other levels are made in accordance with civil service terms generally.</P>
      <P>With regard to part (2) and part (5) of the question it would be necessary for the Deputy, in the context of the new administrative budget system, to put this question down to each individual Minister. In the case of my own Department and the offices for which I am responsible, the information sought is set out in the tables which I will have circulated with this reply.</P>
      <P>With regard to part (4) of the question, performance pay applies at present to the assistant secretary grade only and is administered independently by each Department.  In my Department and in the offices under my aegis a total of 24 officers are on performance pay.</P>

      <P>The corncrake is a protected species, as are all wild birds, under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  The EC Directive on the conservation of wildbirds (No. 409 of 1979) establishes a system of general protection for all wildbirds including the corncrake, throughout the member states of the European Community.  This Directive is implemented in Ireland under the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Irish Wildbird Conservancy have launched a campaign to raise some funds for the purchase of land important for this species in the Shannon Callows, one of the five key areas for corncrakes in the country and hope to get 50 per cent funding from the European Community.  The Wildlife Service, Office of Public Works, have agreed to a request from the Irish Wildbird Conservency to assist in a nest finding exercise in the Moy Catchment, County Mayo which is an important habitat area for the species.</P>

      <P>The EC Directive on the conservation of wild birds, No. 409 of 1979, establishes a system of general protection for all wild birds throughout the member states of the European Community.  This Directive is implemented in Ireland under the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  Statutory Instrument No. 397 of 1985 [European Communities (Wildlife Act, 1976) (Amendment) Regulations 1985] refers.</P>
      <P>Hunting of all game species, including migratory, is reviewed each year having regard to the conservation status of the species.  If scientific evidence suggests that a particular game species is under threat it will be removed from the open season order made under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  A copy of the open season order for 1990 is being included in the Official Report for information.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that adequate legislation is in place to prevent overshooting of migratory species in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981, has not been brought into force for two reasons, (1) many of the provisions of the Act require the preparation of regulations but in some instances the power to make regulations is defective; (2) the general thrust of the Act has been superseded by developments in the psychiatric services, particularly since the publication of the report, <i>Planning for the Future.</i></P>
      <P>My Department are currently reviewing all aspects of mental health legislation. Following this review, which will include consultation with interested parties, it is my intention to put forward proposals for new mental health legislation which will protect the interests of patients and facilitate the development of community psychiatric services as recommended in <i>Planning for the Future.</i></P>
      <P>Information on admissions to psychiatric hospitals and acute units, including those compulsorily admitted, is collected and published each year by the Health Research Board.  The board's figures show that about 11 per cent of persons admitted to psychiatric hospitals each year, about 2,500 people, were involuntary admissions.  Information on the numbers of involuntary patients spending six months or more in hospital is collected but not included in the board's report. The information is being assembled and will be sent to the Deputy in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical profession does not have <Col N="399" /> legal immunity under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  Section 260 provides that the High Court must grant leave before civil proceedings can be instituted in respect of action taken under the Act.  As the judgment and reasons of a person suffering from mental illness may be impaired, it is necessary to provide safeguards against unnecessary legislation while at the same time respecting the individual's right to seek redress from the courts.  The current review of mental health legislation will address the issue of access by involuntary patients to the courts, in the light of modern standards of legal redress.</P>

      <P>The allocations of teaching posts to community-comprehensive schools and to vocational education committees are expressed in whole-time teacher equivalents, thus leaving the relevant management authorities discretion to make either part-time or whole-time appointments in accordance with school needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to my Department's records 158 teachers out of a total of 2,458 teachers in community-comprehensive schools (approximately 6 per cent) are currently <Col N="405" /> employed in a temporary whole-time capacity.  In the second level vocational schools the position is that less than 5 per cent, i.e. 220, out of approximately 4,500 posts are temporary whole-time.  Details of the number of temporary teachers in secondary schools are not readily available.</P>
    <P>It is open to both the community-comprehensive schools and second level vocational schools sectors to fill approved teaching posts in a permanent whole-time capacity provided such are warranted by reference to the approved teacher allocation.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that a significant number of the temporary posts in second level schools relate to replacements for teachers on career breaks whose posts are kept open.  Other temporary appointments will relate to certain courses, the future of which are not definite.</P>
