      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday evening I invited the Taoiseach to visit Beaumont Hospital, which is in a state of crisis.  The Taoiseach declined to take up that offer but I went out myself.  In the accident and emergency unit last night, it was perfectly obvious that porters, nurses, doctors and consultants are doing everything they can to make life somewhat comfortable for patients.  There were approximately 50 patients in the accident and emergency unit.  All cubicles were filled, on both sides of that unit.  All of those patients were assessed for admission and all were too sick to go home, but no beds were available in the hospital.</P>
        <P>The first problem the Taoiseach does not seem to appreciate is that there is a problem in north <Col N="2"/>Dublin as far as long-stay beds are concerned.  There are between 80 and 100 people in that hospital who should be in long-stay beds elsewhere.  The only commitment that has been broken here has been by his Government.</P>
        <P>I know what is wrong out there, I know the solution to the problem and I know what the Taoiseach could do about it, but he does not seem to want to do it.  The solution, which the Taoiseach appreciates, is that he must deal with the issue of long-stay beds.  Since Leas Cross and Sutton were taken out of commission, they are down by 140 beds.  The Government made two specific commitments.  The first was to provide a medical admissions unit at Beaumont Hospital.  It has not happened.  Second, his Government, in a state of national emergency, said it would provide 100 beds at St. Joseph&rsquo;s in Raheny and 200 beds in St. Mary&rsquo;s in the Phoenix Park.  The Government has not provided them.  This problem will continue in Beaumont Hospital until that aspect is addressed.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach take responsibility for this because those who are supposed to have responsibility for it are doing very little about it?  Those beds have not appeared, and will not appear, and this problem will continue until he sorts it out.</P>

	<P Just="Left">One 78 year old woman had been sitting on a hard chair for 24 hours.  She was assessed as being too sick to go home, but there was no place available in the hospital.  It is the responsibility of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government to provide those units and beds.  I see hotels being built on 24-hour shifts around the country, but regarding the most important buildings of all, hospitals, where people have no place at the inn, the Government has broken its commitments.  What will the Taoiseach do about it?</P>

	<P>Deputy McGrath, you will have to leave the House.  There will be no delays this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, I stated that four of the 52 acute hospitals were having difficulties this week and I acknowledged the work the staff have been doing with the substantial additional resources, beds and facilities they have been given to make an enormous improvement on the waiting list this winter.  They have brought down the length of stay in accident and emergency departments by over 50%.  I also acknowledged that Beaumont Hospital and three of the other 52 acute hospitals are having difficulties at present and I stated that the senior people in the HSE, who have been working on the winter initiative and the accident and emergency departments generally, have been working with them.  I appreciate that fact.</P>
        <P>After Leas Cross and some of the other difficulties in north Dublin, a number of points were raised by the HSE where they required additional facilities.  St. Joseph&rsquo;s, Raheny, is in use.  As Deputy Kenny would have found out, approximately a year ago I visited the wards they opened at that time and it is in operation.  They have introduced a number of other facilities.</P>
        <P>There is a difficulty in four or five areas, mainly but not only in north Dublin.  The bed numbers are down.  Several times in the year they have patients who, in the normal course, could go home but it is just not possible for them to do so given their circumstances.  Generally, such patients are elderly people who would be on their own.  That is a risk that cannot be taken and, therefore, they need step-down facilities.</P><Col N="4"/>
        <P>The HSE, in Dublin and around the country, does all it can to provide step-down beds, in both nursing homes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Kenny, in 2007 the HSE is providing 360 extra beds by way of contracts with the private sector &mdash; it is not a question of 50 beds.  Of these, 220 are in the greater Dublin area, 100 in the south and 40 in the western region.  It is not a question of 50 beds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a question of 50 beds in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should talk to the staff.  I talked to them over the weekend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>One should talk to the people who know the position.  Public capacity has been increased by some 446 beds.  It is not, therefore, a question of 50 beds.</P>
        <P>The HSE is very aware of the problems at Beaumont Hospital and has been working with it to try to increase capacity.  As I stated yesterday, to try to avoid the problems experienced by the accident and emergency staff, the out-of-hours doctors systems and rapid access clinic in Smithfield have been opened.  The latter is directly helping north Dublin.  The facilities in James Connolly Memorial Hospital associated with the hospital-in-the-home concept have been put into operation and the community intervention teams are in place.  All of these measures are directly designed to help the people to whom Deputy Kenny is referring.  The schemes are working well and were not in operation 12 months ago.  This does not mean that from time to time there will be no difficulties in some hospitals.  These difficulties must be managed and will not all be solved overnight.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s last reply smacks of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s observation that the crisis in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital was manufactured by people in white coats looking concerned.  The point is I know there is a problem because I was at Beaumont Hospital last night.  The Taoiseach was not and is removing himself from the problem but it will not go away.  Doctors in the accident and emergency unit told me that they must assess patients, irrespective of their circumstances, in a state of indignity and without privacy.  The problem will not go away, unless the Taoiseach deals with it.  He can mention all the figures and statistics he likes and tell me the HSE knows about the matter, but he must realise that he is the Leader of the Government, whose job it is to ensure it is resolved.  The problem epitomises the failure of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats after ten years.</P>

	<P>It is time for the Government to go away.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether the Taoiseach likes it, a commitment was made to put in place a medical admissions unit, 100 beds at St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital in Fairview and 200 at St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital in the Phoenix Park.  The medical admissions unit has not been provided.  When we get into government in a few months, I would like to call in those who are supposed to be responsible for the delivery of these beds.  Why does the Government not fast-track those two hospital building projects, if not them all, in the critical infrastructure Bill?  Why does the Taoiseach not call in the architects and HSE representatives and ask why nothing is happening, in spite of his having made a commitment to the people to provide the beds mentioned at St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital and St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital?</P>
        <P>What is happening in Beaumont Hospital is not a one night stand.  It is happening every night and on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s watch.  Neither he nor the Government seems to appreciate the scale of frustration, indignity and collapse over which he <Col N="6"/>presides.  This is the problem and it will not go away.  Will he take personal responsibility to ensure the commitments made by his Government are honoured?  If there were a serious accident in the Dublin Port tunnel &mdash; God forbid &mdash; or on his beloved M50, for which he paid &euro;600 million yesterday, Beaumont hosptial would certainly not be able to cope.</P>
        <P>On the problem of long-stay beds in north County Dublin, will the Taoiseach take responsibility for delivering or fast-tracking the 100 beds mentioned at St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital in Fairview, 200 beds at St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital and the medical admissions unit at Beaumont Hospital?  Will he answer these questions rather than listing statistics that go on forever?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer them.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>First, St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital is in Raheny, not Fairview.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a wonder the Taoiseach knows the difference.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Is he sure it was not Beaumont Hospital?  He knows he has not delivered&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Members on both sides of the House to allow the Taoiseach to contribute without interruption. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer the question because that is the easy part; however, it does not solve the problem.  The 100 beds in St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital are being commissioned and will be ready this year.  There is no problem about this.  The St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital development is under way.  The people dealing with these tasks will complete them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital, the work is happening but it will not solve the whole problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but it would solve the exit problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not need to do anything in respect of the two commissions; both are under way and being fast-tracked, with many other schemes.  I would love to be able to tell Deputy Kenny that the completion of the two jobs will solve all the problems.  That is the point.  Given <Col N="7"/>the age profile and population structure in the catchment area of the Dublin teaching hospitals&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the medical admissions unit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Practically every night an average of 100 patients could be discharged but, because of their family circumstances, they are not.  They really require a step-down facility.</P>
        <P>Consider the third step the HSE is taking.  As the Deputy knows, there are ongoing talks about Leas Cross and efforts are being made to recommission the beds.  That will probably happen this year also.  The institution will be under different management and have different structures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>We should be under a different Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE is also in discussions with other current and prospective private nursing home providers with a view to securing beds to allow additional discharges from hospitals.  Most are private but one cannot be certain about them because they are not in the hands of the State.  It should be noted that, in respect of addressing the problem of delayed discharges in acute hospitals, approximately 1,088 older patients have been subject to placement to date.  I am afraid we are talking about many people and dealing with 50, 60 or 70 will not solve the problem.  Looking at the figures, I do not know whether 200 beds at St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, mainly for the geriatric unit, and 100 beds in Raheny will solve it either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the medical admissions unit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The medical admissions unit was among the ten points listed.  As I understand it, most of those issues are on track.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not a sign of them.  That is a Bertie answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no great difficulty with any of them.  Bearing in mind the difficulties, it still seems that in terms of bed capacity which is being examined by the HSE, it will be necessary to build a step-down facility either in north or west Dublin, the two areas experiencing acute difficulties.  The age profile of the population in question which lives in some of the most densely populated areas in the entire country is such that additional facilities are required.  Although all the proposed developments will be completed this year, in addition to the developments of 2006 and 2005, four of the 52 hospitals will still face constant difficulties.  Two of them are located in north Dublin.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 2001 I have been raising with the Taoiseach the daily torment inflicted on motorists who must use the West Link toll bridge.  During this time the Government has prevaricated and taken different positions.  Now, within sight of the general election, we read it has decided to buy the bridge.  Will the Taoiseach state the exact position?  Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement which coincided with the additional chaos arising from the diversion of 2,200 trucks from the port tunnel onto the bridge does not seem to advance us beyond what the Taoiseach told the House last November.  The deal has not been concluded and the Minister states in the small print of the statement that he hopes it will be concluded soon.  The situation on the bridge has been dramatically worsened by 2,200 trucks, which are the equivalent of 6,000 cars, and by the commencement of the renovation of the M50.  These factors have made the already intolerable circumstances confronting motorists immensely worse.  Is it the case that buying back this bridge, the original deal for which was &euro;38 million, will cost us &euro;600 million?  The original deal signed by P&aacute;draig Flynn and George Redmond&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The contract will be finished in two weeks and there will be one tolling point on the road.  The contract for the new operator of the barrier-free toll is under negotiation and will be awarded shortly.  That should be in place in 2008.  Phases one and three of the construction of the M50, which is a &euro;1 billion project, will be finished to coincide with the implementation of barrier-free tolling.  That should have a significant impact on the efficiency and movement of the 100,000 vehicles which travel the M50.  We have been endeavouring, along with the completion and major success of the tunnel and the work on the Naas road, to finish the intervening sections.  It will take three to three and a half years, or until the end of 2010, to complete all stages of the upgrade of the M50.  Barrier-free tolling and the completion of phases one and three and, by 2010, the later phases should have a significant impact.</P>

	<P>It is not going to work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The key point is not additional money.  When we buy National Toll Roads&rsquo; rights on the road for &euro;50 million, the income will come back to the State for upgrading the M50.  It will not be a case of double money because NTR will cease to receive it.  That is how the contract will operate.  We made the decision and there has been no change.  One year ago, I said in this House that the NRA, with the agreement of the Minister for Transport and the Government, decided the arrangement with NTR under the 1987 agreement for the collection of tolls on the West Link until 2020 would end and those discussions have continued for eight months.  NTR has to be compensated in line with an agreement entered into by the Government and the local authorities and we are duty bound to deliver.  The Minister will conclude those agreements in the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>In respect of the tunnel, Deputy Rabbitte may take issue with the figures but I want to congratulate all the engineers involved.  It was the biggest infrastructure project ever completed by the State.  The HGV management strategy introduced by Dublin City Council was a tremendous success.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I also thank the truckers for the 50% increase.  The reason we built the tunnel was to take vehicles away from residential areas and put them onto the M50.  That was the plan 20 years ago.  There has been a reduction of 80% in the number of trucks going through and polluting residential areas all over the city and they are <Col N="12"/>now on a road on which &euro;1 billion is being spent for construction.  Admittedly, it would have been nice if people had been able to foresee that a successful Government would have had economic growth of 7% for ten years or that the road would have had a significant impact. </P>

	<P>Do I take it from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply that within two weeks the bridge will be bought back for &euro;600 million and that the current private toll will be replaced by a public toll?  What is the position in respect of the 18 months before barrier-free tolling will be implemented?  Ireland penalises motorists more than any country in the European Union in terms of taxation, such as VRT, and the cost of using this bridge, which comes to approximately &euro;1,300 for a family that uses it to commute to and from work each day.  This constitutes an imposition on motorists.

	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s partners are deserting the sinking ship in Cork at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the Government decided to buy out NTR from a contract dating from 1987.  As for the arguments on who negotiated the contract, the records make it clear who did so.  However, that is neither here nor there.</P>
        <P>From August 2008, a new company will take over the barrier-free tolling.  Negotiations in this regard are ongoing and it will be appointed shortly.  This will coincide with the completion of the work of phases 1 and 3 of the M50 upgrade, on which a total of &euro;1 billion is being spent.  Another phase will be completed by 2010.  From 2008, the revenues that will be generated on the M50 will revert to the State.  Such revenues are approximately &euro;45 million at present and, depending on their levels, they will go towards the upgrade of the road.</P>
        <P>However, the Government must complete the contract.  As I noted, it is not double money.  I believe that developments on both the Naas Road and on either side of the M50 are crucial in this respect because more or less the same traffic goes on to it.  I am aware of the view that the easy solution would be to remove the toll, after which everything would be resolved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Try it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been done a number of times.  I was even present on one occasion at which a trial was conducted.  The engineers involved are the same people who have undertaken the biggest infrastructural job in Europe recently and their view is that doing so would <Col N="15"/>accomplish very little.  While a car going straight through might benefit, on the interchanges and on a number of the other points, they believe it would create far more difficulty.  All the advice was to finish the Naas Road and the tunnel, perform the upgrade and get rid of the toll barriers.  We have followed a consistent policy that is now approximately three years from completion.</P>
        <P>I readily admit that the difficulty arose because 20 years ago, when negotiating the contract, people believed there would be 25,000 cars by 2010 whereas there are now 100,000 cars.  They did not envisage 7,000 trucks and thought there would be approximately 2,000 trucks.  They did not envisage the extent of the increase.  However, this happens throughout the world.  It happens in respect of airports and rail lines and people continually upgrade them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not happen as often as it happens here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the reason that infrastructural development is an ongoing process throughout the world.</P>
        <P>The Naas Road and the tunnel are finished and &euro;1 billion is being spent on the M50.  The Government will buy out NTR and will remove the barrier toll.  It will be a single price in that people will go through it and receive one account for one crossing.  It will not be multipoint and this will be in place by August 2008.  The total completion of the M50 upgrade will occur in 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I wish to raise the accusation levelled at me last week by the Taoiseach when he stated I was telling him a twisted pack of lies.  In order to prove how mistaken he is, I will give him the letter from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that urges D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council not to adopt the standards it subsequently adopted.  Second, I refer to the two articles, one from <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and the other from a construction magazine, <i>Construct Ireland</i>, stating that less than 2% of all houses comply with Part L of the Building Regulations 1997.  This follows a survey conducted by Sustainable Energy Ireland, which has not been published even though it was carried out in 2005.  I look forward to its publication.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach might reflect on this point as it does not simply pertain to people being cold in their homes, paying exorbitant heating bills and in some cases being obliged to take out loans to pay the bills.  This pertains to heating, which in terms of the contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, constitutes approximately one third of energy use in Ireland.  The proportion caused by heating requires serious attention, particularly as the Taoiseach had no difficulty last weekend in telling his followers in Galway that Ireland would <Col N="16"/>have no problem in meeting its Kyoto Protocol targets.</P>
        <P>I take it that the Taoiseach did not actually mean reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but paying the estimated &euro;700 million per annum in carbon credits.  This money, which should be invested in hospitals or other essential services, will leave Ireland.</P>
        <P>I seek clarity in this regard because today&rsquo;s newspapers report that, yesterday, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, pledged with other EU Ministers to cut climate change gases by 20% below 1990 levels.  A 20% reduction from 1990 levels presents a sizeable challenge for Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Essentially, this constitutes a 35% cut in Ireland, even without any growth.  However, the Government&rsquo;s policies are causing a 2% rise in climate change gases per annum although it must put in place reductions of 3.5% per annum.</P>
        <P>There is a mismatch between the Taoiseach&rsquo;s policies and his rhetoric.  Is the Government committing Ireland to a 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2020?  Apparently this commitment has been made at a European Council of Ministers meeting.  Is the Taoiseach making such a commitment in the House, where national accountability dictates such commitments ought to be made?  What actions will he take to ensure that measures to effect a 3.5% cut per annum will be put in place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first point, and I will reply to Deputy Sargent if he gives me the papers.  We need not debate it here.  Some 97% or 98% of the houses had a problem and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government told the local authority not to involve itself.  I since looked at the papers and Deputy Sargent is incorrect.  However, I will answer him for the record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is written in black and white.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Taoiseach will not follow it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent is right that it is an important issue.  Regarding a new international agreement to continue progress made under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in the medium to long term to 2020 and beyond, environment ministers met yesterday to agree a position whereby the European Union would propose that developed nations agree to reduce greenhouse gas production by 30% in the post-Kyoto period after <Col N="17"/>2012.  Failing to reach agreement with other developed nations which will be difficult the European Union suggests it would agree unilaterally to a 20% reduction target.  The position was strongly supported on behalf of the Government by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting.</P>
        <P>The point I made at the weekend is that we successfully decoupled our greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Sargent, Ireland has successfully decoupled its greenhouse gas emissions.  From 1990 to 2005, emissions grew by 25% whereas our economy grew by 150%.  This is reflected in the emissions intensity of the Irish economy.  In 2004, emissions per unit of GDP were 48% of their 1990 level.  The equivalent figure for the European Union is 78%.</P>
        <P>The actions we must take include setting a steeply ambitious target to deliver one third of electricity from renewable sources by 2020, making maximum uses of new technologies for co-generation in Irish power stations with biomass, planning for the use of carbon capture, clean coal generation technology with which Deputy Sargent will agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I appeal to members of the Green Party to remain in silence and hear the answer to the question.  If they do not wish to do so they should leave the House.  If they do not leave the House the Chair will facilitate them by using Standing Orders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We require the public sector to lead the way on energy efficiency.  We are improving the energy efficiency of new Irish homes by up to 40% and more and the use of solar energy and other microrenewable technologies in homes and businesses.  None of those issues should upset the Green Party.  They should receive its support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the 2% increase?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not convinced by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply.  He mentioned decoupling of economic growth.  As was stated before, a decreasing rate of increase is not a decrease.  Let us be clear.  As was already stated, a 7% increase <Col N="19"/>per annum in transport emissions is unsustainable and goes in the wrong direction.  Does the Taoiseach accept this?</P>
        <P>Does he accept a need for annual targets which he can live by which means 3.5%?  If we are to reach a 40% cut which is what we are discussing overall when the European figure is in place we will need a 3.5% cut per annum.  Currently, we are going the wrong way.  We are going over<?oasys _jy ?>2%.  The Taoiseach mentioned leadership from the European Union.  The United Nations states the EU is becoming complacent in comparison with the US and Asia.</P>
        <P>New Zealand is a country not unlike our own.  It is non-nuclear, of similar size and with a large Irish population.  The Prime Minister, Helen Clark, stated New Zealand will become the world&rsquo;s first carbon neutral country.  The New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development welcomed it as a sea change in the way the country will handle climate change and protect its trading position for long-term success.</P>
        <P>A great deal rests on what the Taoiseach decides.  I ask him again to be absolutely clear that the message he gives to everybody in society is that he will be intent on cutting our emissions by 3.5% per annum.  That will at least comply with the minimal rate which the EU set.  It is not world leading but at least it is a start.  Will the Taoiseach undertake to bring this about?</P>

I am not saying that is not a big challenge.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There are currently five special advisers appointed by me.  The Deputy will be aware that one of my special advisers recently took up office with the Health Service Executive and no decision has yet been taken on a replacement.</P>
        <P>There has been no increase in the number of special advisers since I took office.  Under the <Col N="22"/>direction of the programme manager, the primary function of the advisers is to monitor, facilitate and help secure the achievement of Government objectives and ensure effective co-ordination in the implementation of the programme for Government.  They are also tasked with giving me advice and keeping me informed on a wide range of issues, including business, financial, economic, political, administrative and media matters and performing such other functions as may be directed by me from time to time.</P>
        <P>Each of the advisers liaises with a number of Departments and acts as a point of contact in my office for Ministers and their advisers.  My advisers attend meetings of Cabinet committees and cross-departmental teams relevant to their responsibilities.  They also liaise, on my behalf, with organisations and interest groups outside of Government.</P>
        <P>In addition, a number of my advisers have specific responsibilities regarding speech drafting.  My programme manager meets other ministerial advisers on a weekly basis.  He monitors and reports to me on progress in implementing the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>Other non-Civil Service staff appointed by me are the Government press secretary and deputy Government press secretary or head of Government Information Services, the Government Chief Whip&rsquo;s personal assistant and personal secretary, the personal secretary assigned to my constituency office and the personal assistant assigned to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the difference between a special political adviser and a programme manager in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department?  What has been the cost of the five special political advisers engaged by the Taoiseach over the past couple of years?  How frequently do the special political advisers sit down with the Taoiseach and report progress or otherwise on the implementation of the programme for Government?  Are the meetings regular or do they occur now and again?  Is there a set process in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department whereby the special political advisers come together to advise the Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I need to tot up the figures to give the overall cost of the advisers.  I will give the figure later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism is good at figures, he would be quick at it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I may ask him to tot it for me.  I have a list of costs but not the total.  I have published the schedule before.</P>
        <P>The advisers work closely with individual Departments.  When we changed the system a decade ago I assigned them to individual Departments, so normally their work entails liaising with ministerial advisers in the Departments.  I meet <Col N="23"/>them on a weekly basis, depending on what issues are relevant.  I may confer with them on a daily basis on Northern Ireland issues or on European business in the week before a European meeting.  They also attend Cabinet committees, which are either weekly or monthly.  I meet with them collectively once or twice a week.  I try to keep them linked to Departments because it makes more sense.</P>
        <P>There are two programme managers, one for my Department and one for the T&aacute;naiste.  They hold seniority and the programme manager in my Department chairs the weekly meeting of programme managers from the other Departments, as well as having responsibility for a number of Departments himself.</P>
        <P>Does that cover the Deputy&rsquo;s questions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked how frequently they brief the Taoiseach and give advice, which he probably has much of anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They keep me up to date, whatever about the advice.</P>
        <P>There is a formal working session on Mondays, depending on what issues are pertinent.  European and Northern Ireland issues could necessitate more frequent meetings.  With European business in particular, a key person is put in place from the country holding the EU Presidency who passes information on several times a week.  This is increasingly being done by telephone contact, which is more efficient.</P>
        <P>The German Chancellor has been doing a very good job where all her meetings are being fed back into the system almost on a daily basis.  It is quite a challenge for the personnel involved because they have to ring 27 countries with updates.  Many of these issues are current and the European agenda is getting more complex and demanding.</P>
        <P>A unified position being created takes up more and more time, and unfortunately it is different to our system.  Some prime ministers may not attend parliament as much as here and they involve themselves extensively in European issues.  Therefore, more time is spent here phoning around, but it nevertheless it is an important part of the work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Taoiseach explain the background to the increase in 2006 in the cost of political advisers?  I asked about the next matter before but I will do so again because it continues to grow in urgency.  Does the Taoiseach intend to at least beef up the advice he gets on climate change?  The New Zealand Prime Minister has stated climate change to be similar to the threat of a nuclear holocaust during the Cold War.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="24"/>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed not, and I will not.  I have a relevant question on political advisers.  Will the issue be a matter for an adviser who will work with the Taoiseach, given the overall responsibility he holds for Departments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The total cost sought by Deputy Kenny is &euro;560,000, excluding the Chief Whip and T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s programme manager.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s questions, I depend on the staff in outside agencies and those dealing with the matter in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I do not have an expert of my own on climate change but there are people with considerable expertise within the system.</P>
        <P>Deputy Sargent is correct and as this is increasingly an issue on the European agenda, I receive advice on a regular basis directly from the Department and officials within the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach yesterday maintained that the communications unit within his Department was totally apolitical.  That could certainly not be stated in any sense with regard to political advisers.  Is there a role for these political advisers after the Taoiseach dissolves the D&aacute;il and between then and the general election specifically?  Are they stood down for that period or do they continue to work with and advise the Taoiseach?</P>
        <P>For example, Deputies going forward for re-election will get letters warning them not to use Oireachtas offices, postage or other facilities for their election campaign.  That is fair enough as it is supposed to be the level playing pitch for people who are not Members of the Oireachtas.  What will be the position of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s advisers in that case?</P>
        <P>The restrictions put on personnel employed by ordinary Members is that they should be sent off for a few weeks break.  Will the same happen with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s advisers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Effectively, that is what happens.  If these personnel involve themselves in the political process, which most of them would do, they must take leave from their post.  If any of them are involved in the day-to-day work of Government, as distinct from the campaign, they can stay.  The last time all of my people, bar one, were involved in the campaign and had to clear out of the building.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Recently, there was controversy regarding the cost of ministerial advisers incurred by the Exchequer, after which a new protocol was introduced.  Does it apply to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s advisers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They must comply fully with the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Acts and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  They have annual forms to fill out and must com<Col N="25"/>ply with all of the protocols of the Civil Service under the Public Service Management Act 1997.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The role of the cross-departmental team is to identify and assist in advancing and resolving issues related to infrastructural planning and delivery, ensuring they are adequately prepared for consideration by the Cabinet committee on housing, infrastructure and PPPs and, where necessary, the Government.  This preparation has helped to improve significantly the capacity for the delivery of national infrastructure, especially in terms of time and cost.  However, lead responsibility remains clearly with the relevant Minister and Department in respect of each policy area or individual infrastructural project.</P>
        <P>The cross-departmental team is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives from the Departments of Finance, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Education and Science, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Transport, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of the Attorney General.   The team is meeting again today and usually meets on a monthly basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for outlining the Departments represented.  The Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science deal with hospital and school buildings. <Col N="26"/> By anyone&rsquo;s standards, these categories are among the most critical, but they must go through a prolonged planning process.  Has the cross-departmental team suggested these buildings should form part of the critical infrastructure Bill to achieve a faster through-put in delivering projects?  I make this suggestion positively.  Has the cross-departmental team considered the metro line announced some time ago by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and the question of the outer orbital Dublin route?  Does it remain an illusion?  Has its location been affirmed?  How far from the M50 will it run, be it 10 miles, 15 miles or 20 miles?  These are major pieces of infrastructure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first point, the State had more freedom when it had fewer resources 20 years ago.  As the Deputy will recall, some of the projects carried out during our political time here did not need planning and were completed through OPW special orders.  That situation changed during the years for good reasons.  The effect of this on projects and their assessment has been a dramatic improvement in procedures, particularly in terms of road construction.  The quality of the NRA&rsquo;s staff, resources and the technical teams it has built during the past six or seven years is superb.</P>
        <P>Regarding the schools building programme, we used to undertake six big projects at a time.  This year there are 1,500, from A to Z.  The equivalent figure 20 years ago was probably 30.  It is a different issue and the design has been changed, that is, more standardised designs are being used.</P>
        <P>Regarding health, the system presents a difficulty, about which there is no doubt.  The time taken for a project to go through the various structures, assessments and processes and to be built and commissioned is very long.  The matter has been examined and some improvements have been made.  Has it improved dramatically?  No, I do not think it has.  It is a slow process for which there are various reasons and answers.  As the Deputy stated, I turned the sod and opened a 500-bed hotel in the airport region, whereas a health project had passed through one stage before anyone turned a sod.  Some projects I announced six or seven years ago have still not been finished, but that is part of the system.  Can it be improved?  I will not argue that it cannot.  There are huge costs in the system.</P>
        <P>Regarding the answers given on the issues raised, there is a big difference between a hotel and a highly sophisticated ward or theatre with its special flooring, tubing, suction, cardiology equipment and so on.  Some 500 reasons are given before one starts as to why matters cannot be completed far more quickly.  Can something be done more quickly?  Yes.  Can it be done more quickly under the current system?  I doubt it.  That there are so many hands involved presents a difficulty.  If the Deputy was doing it, would he do it this way?  He would not.  There is a huge degree <Col N="27"/>of bureaucracy around these matters.  For every step forward, we take 16 backwards.  That is the honest answer.  It is not for lack of effort that the situation has not improved.</P>
        <P>On the metro, a lot of progress has been made and the team&rsquo;s professionalism has been considerable.  I have a lot of confidence in the team which has done a good job on the Luas extensions and brought in expertise in the form of individuals who have worked on similar projects in other countries.  This country does not have that expertise, although some Irish people have worked on similar projects abroad and returned.  It is a big project, but I have confidence in the team.  It seems to have good time slots and movements and its procedures are based on modern legislation.  It is making a lot of progress, particularly in terms of the Dublin transportation authority legislation.  The authority is working on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, which is fine, but it needs to be legislated for.  The team comprises an efficient group which is going about its business in a professional way, judging by the briefings we have received.</P>
        <P>On the outer route, the preliminary work is ongoing in the form of a feasibility study.  The Deputy knows my position on the matter, namely, that I have been pressing for it within the group because it is necessary.  The Deputy spoke about the M50, but if one examines the file on it &mdash; I have read it more than once for obvious reasons &mdash; one will see that planning for it began in 1950.  The road was opened in 1990, based mainly on assessments made in 1978.  The bridge was the last part.  The system did not consider the M50 necessary or viable.  The Department of Finance did not consider it viable or necessary while I was there.</P>
        <P>Regarding the outer orbital route, we are effectively discussing a date of 2020, although the NRA could probably complete it far more quickly.  We must forget the figures on the line and scale and build it to international standards, which I have made clear to the system.  Trying to project figures is a lost cause.  While Deputy Sargent will not like me for saying this, it is a fact that we are well under the EU average in terms of car usage.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are still way under the EU average for cars.  If one talks to the people who are usually right about these matters &mdash; perhaps somebody can stop them &mdash; there will be more rather than less.  On that outer orbital route both in terms of size and scale we need to look far beyond the box and that is what I have been driving towards within the system and at the committee. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The crucial role of the committee is to assist in resolving major infrastructural problems.  What role has the sub-committee played, leading up to the decision by the Government to pay &euro;600 million to National Toll Roads to buy out the M50 toll bridge?  Is the sub-committee fully aware of the daily torture endured by tens of thousands of working people as they try to cross the Liffey at the M50 toll bridge on a daily basis?  I see the Taoiseach is commemorating today the flight of the earls.  It is just as well they did not have to go through the M50 or they would never have got away.  They would still be languishing there, just like many of our people. </P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question appears to be one that should be addressed to the line Minister.  The House will allow general questioning on this matter but detailed questions are a matter for the line Minister concerned. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach referred to this issue and I want to get to the nub of the matter.  Contracts have to be fair and equitable.  Is it anything other than an unfair contract or gangster capitalism that a private corporation can build a bridge for the equivalent of &euro;38 million and then hold the taxpayer to ransom for &euro;600 million to buy it out? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is really a question for the line Minister, and does not arise on Leaders&rsquo; Questions. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It relates to the critical issue of infrastructure. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="29"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not discussing infrastructure in detail in these questions.  We are dealing with the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the Taoiseach. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It relates to the role of the interdepartmental sub-committee on housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but not detailed responses. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>My question relates to PPPs and infrastructure.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to confine himself to the matter in question. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to be helpful to the people I represent and who must go through this grind daily.  The Taoiseach is proposing a new electronic tolling system costing over &euro;100 million.  I join with Deputy Rabbitte in asking the Taoiseach to lift those tolls immediately, so that we may see the problems that might emerge&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a question for the line Minister and does not arise out of these questions.  The Chair has ruled on this matter. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle is being very unreasonable with me today.  My last question has to do with infrastructural investment, particularly in the critical area of transport, which in Dublin city is one of the crucial problems confronting our people.  Has it ever occurred to the Taoiseach that sometimes the solutions might be much simpler than they are made out to be?  Is he aware, for example, that this week when the schools are off traffic moves much more freely through the city?  Why does he not propose to the interdepartmental sub-committee that perhaps a dedicated school bus system serving every school in this city and bringing students to the schools from where they live could remove at a stroke thousands of private vehicles from the roads?  Why do we not think simply in that regard?  My unfortunate constituents in Dublin West spend an hour and a half or two hours accessing Dublin city centre.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, please. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that a pilot scheme should be introduced to run buses from the key areas of that very concentrated population centre?  Uninterrupted bus lanes should be run into the city centre with sufficient buses and at a stroke we could remove thousands of private cars and bring people into the city by public transport in about half an hour.  That does not require metros or 15-year plans, but rather simple investment and imaginative thinking. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="30"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has asked me an enormous range of questions.  There is &euro;16 billion in the national development plan, and there was &euro;9 billion in its predecessor for public transport initiatives.  I am in favour of bus corridors, increased buses and rail cars.  The first 12 out of 60 trains are coming on stream and there are more than 100 buses.  An order has been put in for another 100 buses and I am in favour of all those initiatives.</P>
        <P>Surveys show that when the schools are open parents bring their children and they all leave more or less at the one time.  If a school opens at 8.50 a.m., there is an enormous congregation of people at that time.  When the parents are working the congestion is spread out over longer periods throughout the day.  My route to work today took 40 minutes less, for instance, because the schools were closed.  Friends of mine who live further out say they saved an hour and a quarter on Monday, so there is no doubt that the schools issue is the problem.  It is not that the parents are not around, though I accept some young parents may take some time off to be with their children.  Most people, however, are still working and the problem is the congregation of time, with everyone centralising around the same hour.  It is a big problem.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is very much in favour of what the Deputy said concerning dedicated bus corridors.  He wants to do more in this regard on the quays and to have more buses.  These are policies we agree with and are anxious to pursue.</P>
        <P>I am not going to get into an argument about the contract.  A State contract was agreed.  The law officers of the State, officials etc. were involved in that contract.  The contract must be dealt with and it is one we must get out of, regardless of what the Deputy or I may think about anyone involved.  As regards the M50 toll barriers, I have questioned the relevant people at length.  I do not disagree with the Deputy&rsquo;s thinking.  However, all the people involved share a unanimous view to the effect that the lifting of the Westlink toll barriers will not solve the congestion being experienced at various locations along the M50.  It is acknowledged that the Westlink toll plaza, its approaches and departure sections are inadequate to deal with current traffic levels.  It is also true that there are infrastructural deficiencies along other sections of the M50, particularly at key interchanges.  It is the combination of these factors that gives rise to the delays being experienced by motorists using the M50 as well as those who use the radial routes that traverse the motorway.  The Government and the National Roads Authority are fully committed to improving the level of service provided to motorists on the M50 and we believe this can best be achieved by three initiatives: the &euro;1 billion M50 upgrade, which is underway; the removal of the Westlink toll plaza; and the move to barrier-free tolling, which will happen in August 2008.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It could be done on a trial basis. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">They have done that.  They have lifted it for an hour on several occasions to see what the effect might be.  As I said, the M50 upgrade is underway, with phase 1 from the N4 to the Ballymount interchange to be completed by mid-2008 along with phase 3 from the M3 to the N4.  The full upgrade will be completed in 2010.  It is a massive infrastructural project.  It will not be done overnight or without some inconvenience to motorists, but it should be an enormous success when finished.  Barrier-free tolling will be introduced in August 2008, coinciding with the completion of phases one and three.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s description of the construction of health facilities compared to the normal commercial activity involved in the case he cited of a hotel is sobering and dispiriting.  If the man who has been Taoiseach for almost ten years tells us that is the stage of desperation he has reached about moving a project like that from conception to execution, it is a poor lookout.  I accept there are differences but I am not sure I understand how complex the building of a hospital can be.  We put a man on the moon a long time ago.  I am completely bemused. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach occasionally indulges in a little reverie so the Ceann Comhairle should allow me to also wander off in a stream of consciousness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave the Deputy my honest assessment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not disputing it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of PPPs, it was an element of the health strategy that the <Col N="32"/>Government would provide 800 community nursing beds under a PPP.  What happened to that commitment, why was it abandoned, has it been abandoned or is it still on course?</P>
        <P>Is the committee project focused, does it have a role in monitoring the national development plan, or is its approach simply that, for example, metro west is on the agenda today and how can it move forward?  Is there any overall oversight of the implementation of the NDP?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not go back over what I said earlier but I draw a distinction between what can be achieved in other areas such as transport and some areas of education where PPP projects were approved.  When dealing with a PPP, whatever about the cost and other arguments which I have gone through, the difference in terms of time and scale is enormous.  One need only consider the Whitfield project in Waterford.  The people involved came to see me less than two years ago and that facility is fully operational today.  They told me at that time they were buying a site.  I cite that project as against other schemes as to why we proceed by way of PPPs.</P>
        <P>On the question of PPPs and the national development plan, a good oversight of the plan is in place.  A unit in the Department of Finance oversees the costs and planning involved in terms cost benefit analysis, value for money issues, strategic environmental assessments and all other related issues.  It is a dedicated unit which is efficient and good.  It is basically a new unit because of the level of resources involved in spending &euro;6 billion.  There is a high level of efficiency in all those areas.  Some good people have been recruited who are involved in this work.  The cross-departmental Cabinet committee, including the officials, their advisers and others with expertise work closely with it.  The unit is a good and competent one.</P>
        <P>In the area of education projects, where perhaps ten major projects would normally have been undertaken a year, this year some 1,500 projects are being undertaken including major and minor projects under the summer works scheme.  Those involved have geared themselves up; this is happening across the RPA and others are also doing this.  However, there are some areas where such projects do not work nearly as effectively, health clearly being one of them and that has been the case for a number of years.</P>
        <P>The cross-departmental team works well and the monitoring, evaluation, appraisal guidelines in place are good, tight and efficient.  Sometimes one might think the system is working too slowly but in terms of the level of expenditure with which the unit is dealing, and bearing in mind it is taxpayers&rsquo; money, this is an efficient way of dealing with the national development plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="33"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not familiar with every individual capital project in the health area.  A difficulty is that by the time the capital programme is prepared for the building, which is linked to staffing levels, equipment and all the procurement issues, the time span in too long.  With regard to any of the commitments made, the Deputy will find that the projects are moving through the system but as against what can be achieved by way of a PPP project or private project&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was interested to hear the Taoiseach speak about the cross-departmental team on infrastructure and public private partnerships, basically giving us the impression that it is a frustrating experience.  A sense of exasperation and general lack of progress seems to be what sets projects in some areas under it apart.  I wonder if some of that is not self-inflicted.  Has the cross-departmental team taken on board the Taoiseach&rsquo;s stated wish that Mr. Justice Kenny's report recommendations should be implemented?  If so, has the progress made by the team helped towards the implementation of those recommendations, or is it ignoring that stated wish and taking it as an aside without addressing it with sincerity?  Has that stated wish impacted on the discussions and the delivery, particularly in the area of housing and proper planning, which impacts on transport, as the Taoiseach is aware?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A cost benefit analysis has not been carried out on the proposal for a parallel runway at Dublin Airport.  On the last occasion the Taoiseach replied to a question I raised on this proposal, he told me that in the normal course he thought that a cost benefit analysis would be done.  If that is the normal course, does the cross-departmental team set down requirements, whatever about guidelines, that a large project of that sort would certainly need a cost benefit analysis and far more scrutiny than is currently given to that project?  Is the cross-departmental team leading or is it just a victim of other people&rsquo;s mismanagement?</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The cross-departmental team comprises key officials in the various Departments.  The guidelines set down in terms of cost benefit analysis are subject to independent scru<Col N="34"/>tiny.  The central expenditure evaluation unit in the Department of Finance, a question on which I replied to earlier, is charged with promoting best practice in project appraisal and checking compliance with the capital appraisal guidelines set down by the Department of Finance.  The evaluation unit examines individual projects and the cost benefit analysis to ensure compliance with these guidelines and consistency.  Projects costing over &euro;30 million must be monitored through one system and different protocols apply to projects costing under &euro;30 million related to value for money and the other procedures set down by the Department of Finance for capital project.  I do not think there has been difficulties in housing, as there has been record construction.  We have got on top of things in education.  In transport, 11 of the last 14 major contracts have come in on time and on budget.  The health area is slow in comparison to those areas in which the private sector operates.  That is a reality.  Across all other areas, the departmental team drives matters very successfully.  A total of &euro;16 billion will be put into transport infrastructure under the next national development plan.  The total cost of transport under the next plan will be &euro;33 billion.  Roads, airports and other infrastructure are being dealt with very efficiently.</P>

	<P>What about the Kenny report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Kenny report deals with the issue of land, but that only affects price rather than quality of construction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any mechanism for the cross-departmental team to report officially on the work it carries out?  The report could be published at the end of the lifetime of this D&aacute;il and it could outline what the committee has achieved and what it recommended.  I presume the Taoiseach is the line manager, but does he have to make decisions on this area?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach talked about the success of PPPs, but there have also been failures.  The Minister for Health and Children has attempted to improve radiotherapy services across the State by 2011, but reports have suggested that it may not be done until 2013 or 2014.  Do such issues come back to the Taoiseach, or can the relevant Ministers deal with them?  Do they make recommendations on continuing with PPPs or otherwise?  Is there an all-Ireland aspect to the work of this committee?  Eoin Reeves, director of privatisation and PPP research at the University of <Col N="35"/>Limerick, said that the PPPs in Ireland have been unfavourable and untested.</P>
        <P>What role does the committee have in this regard?  Is it Government policy to roll out PPPs?  Can the people on the committee make decisions on PPPs?  In other groups, such as local councils, decisions cannot be made in committees unless they contain a senior representative and they are just talking shops.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Every project goes through a line Department and every major health project goes through the capital assessment unit of the Department of Health and Children.  Every project is bound by appraisals and examinations that follow good accountancy practices.  There are also State agencies involved, such as local authorities, the NRA, the Dublin Airport Authority or whatever.</P>
        <P>The officials in the cross-departmental team are civil servants.  They have access to the design teams and the experts in the various areas.  The system for most of our contracts is as good as anywhere else.</P>
        <P>The revised capital appraisal guidelines for public capital projects are less than two years old.  The ten year envelope for public transport is working very well.  The more efficient price-fixed contracts are working very well.  The PPPs, with the expertise of the NDFA, are also working well, even if they are going slowly in some areas due to complexity.  This is particularly the case in the health area.  The development of roads and regional airports has been very fast.  The fixed price contracts have given much better value for money, with all the contracts coming in on time and on budget.  The system in that respect works well, even if it is slow sometimes.</P>

	<P>No, but we lost 25 minutes on Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That was not my fault.  I wish to ask two questions.</P>
        <P>I refer to a report made available to the Department of Education and Science about the alleged serious drop in standards of young teachers and the difficulties this causes for the maintenance of teaching standards which is so important to the country.  Will the Government make time available for a debate on this matter or does the Minister propose to hold a debate on the implications of the report in order that Deputies can express their concern?</P>
        <P>Regarding the referendum on children, yesterday Deputy Rabbitte raised an issue about the separation of the protection of as against the welfare and rights of children.  I commented on the matter yesterday evening.  Is the Government opposed to holding a referendum now on the question of the zone of absolute protection and the question of soft information?  This was considered in great detail by the committee and in respect of which there is no difficulty or opposition from any party in the House.  Is the Government opposed to holding a referendum on those two issues now?  I am not a constitutional lawyer but the other five issues may cause some difficulty and need to be fully debated.  I committed my party to dealing with the matter before the end of the year, irrespective of what happens in the general election.  Everybody should have the opportunity to tease out the issues and fully understand them, the balance of rights and so on.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="41"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first issue, that is a fairly old and limited report.  It is three years old and was conducted on 140 students.  I understand the matter is being addressed to the colleges.  I do not think it is necessary for the House to debate a report of that nature.</P>
        <P>On the question about the referendum, I stated my view yesterday and on Monday.  We have listened to the views of the Opposition parties.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the people engaged in this matter are of the view that the issues should be taken together.  There might be an argument in favour of two questions being put and we are open to considering it.  I am not taken with the idea that we should hold two referendums on child protection in one year because the rights and protections issues are intertwined.  It would be a case of holding one referendum now on the issue arising from the CC case, that of soft information, and then waiting until later in the year to take the others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not opposed to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We would prefer if they were taken together, whenever that is.  If there was an argument about the two questions and if two referendums were held in the one year, it might be questionable whether young people could be expected to become actively engaged.  I invite the Deputy to make his views known in a referendum debate in order that there will be interest in the issue and a good turnout.  Holding two referendums within a period of seven or eight months does not sound like a great idea but I will listen to the arguments.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot agree that the issues concerning the protection of children and the issues relating to the rights and welfare of children are intertwined in the sense the Taoiseach suggests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question?  We are on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>When I put this question to him yesterday, I did not understand him to rule it out or to say it was without merit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not ruling it out now either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>However, having read the newspapers this morning, it seems the Government has since then decided to rule it out, as that seems to be the sentiment attributed to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>
        <P>Given the growing opinion that it is not feasible or wise to have this omnibus referendum this side of the general election, and given the weight of comment from expert opinion in the newspapers again today that the matter requires further discussion and teasing out, is it not too long to delay the issue relating to the protection of children? <Col N="42"/> Why could we not run with that issue, for example, contemporaneous with the general election, and run with the other issue as soon as a reasonable debate can take place?  Would that not be a more appropriate way to proceed?</P>
        <P>Everybody in the House wants the amendment with regard to the protection of children from sexual predators enacted, and wants that protection afforded to children.  The experts say they need more time to tease through the other propositions to permit us to get it right rather than rush it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to get it right rather than rush it.  However, while I do not know about growing opinion in the newspapers, I know of growing opinion among people who were quite agitated last night and this morning.  They have waited for us to deal with some of the issues that were comprehensively dealt with in the Constitution review report, following the Mrs. Justice McGuinness report of 1993.  It then went for nine years into the all-party committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The wording was only published yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please, Deputy.  It came out of the all-party committee yet ten years on we want more time and some are even suggesting we should have another committee.  Some of the groups are very agitated as a result.</P>
        <P>I am trying to be helpful.  The parties have had the substance of our proposals for several weeks and have had the proposals since Monday.  I understand they must have some time but I would prefer if they could give me their written views on how they see the matter moving forward.  Many of the groups, including adoption groups, believe these are urgent matters which should be dealt with immediately.  These issues are creating much difficulty in many cases.  That is view of the groups.  They do not share the opinion that there should be a delay and that the questions should be intertwined.</P>
        <P>I must consider all of the angles.  If the Opposition parties could give me their considered opinion, we could try to take a path forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach intend to move ahead in the way the Government can move in areas that may be related to but not dependent on the referendum?

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was pointed out that to do that, we would need the protection of the Constitution.  That is why there has been a long delay on this issue.  There has been a long-term mission to outline documents to see whether we can establish a designated statutory body with overall responsibility for collecting and sharing information with other agencies about the risk or occurrence of child sexual abuse or other forms of abuse.  We have engaged in discussions with Northern Ireland to ascertain whether such a body would be established.  I understand it would be easier to achieve this if we had the consolidation of our constitutional cover on it.  That is part of the delay.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In my brief contribution last night I referred to the provision in the Bill to transfer community welfare officers, CWOs, from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  In effect, this changes them from public to civil servants.  The CWOs are concerned by the proposal.  My concern is that the transfer is being made without due discussion or consideration and we could end up with a debacle like that in the health service as a result of the too rapid and badly organised transition from health boards to the Health Service Executive.  That over rapid changeover is one of the reasons we have chaos in health services throughout the country and people do not fully understand their role.</P>
        <P>The CWOs are concerned by the proposal, which I understand was written specifically as a result of the recent public partnership agreement.  It could undermine the quality and range of services community welfare officers provide to some of the most vulnerable people in communities across the country.  As the Minister knows, community welfare officers play an essential role in the community.  As well as making welfare payments, they provide key information, advice, advocacy and referral links to statutory health and personal social services.  Their knowledge of the Department of Health and Children, as well as of social welfare services, is essential to their role.</P>
        <P>The ability of CWOs to make emergency payments is essential to provide for weaker and more vulnerable sections of the community.  They provide an essential and delicate function to a sensitive area and group in society.  Any change to their role, functions and powers will adversely affect weaker sections of the community and people sensitive to changes in income or support.  These people live from day to day and from week to week and never really know what food will be on the table in a week&rsquo;s time.  Their future is uncertain.  Unfortunately, we still have people in society living like this, but with the support of CWOs they have some assurance that if they are unable to put a meal on the table for their families, provide fuel or pay a bill, they can get assistance.</P>
        <P>The proposal hits at the most vulnerable in society and will have an adverse effect on the people for whom CWOs provide.  There has been a lack of consultation on the proposal which seems to have been decided by administrative officers in the Departments of Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, without any real in-depth look at the impact it will have in practice.  The community welfare service sits more appropriately with the Department of Health and Children as it links into the care stra<Col N="48"/>tegies provided by that Department.  For example, vulnerable groups include addicts, people with mental health issues, people with disabilities, single parents, victims of abuse, the elderly, those with chronic anti-social behaviour and those with psychological issues.  In view of this, it is more appropriate that CWOs stay with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The difference of approach in the Department of Social and Family Affairs with regard to proving the right to a claim is totally opposite to the ethos in the Department of Health and Children and will cause problems if the community welfare services are subsumed into that Department.  This is something the Minister should address in his response to the genuine questions raised.  We all know the valuable work CWOs do and the important service they provide for the poorer section of our community.</P>
        <P>Another issue is that of contributory pension.  A woman came to my clinic recently and pointed out that in the early 1950s she did voluntary work for five weeks in a hairdressing salon and the hairdresser in question paid a stamp for her.  When this woman applied for her pension, she was granted a reduced pension because that contribution was on the record.  That is unfair and demonstrates an anomaly in the system which should be rectified.  I ask the Minister to respond to that in his reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite the budget in December, people are feeling the pinch more than ever.  Since the Minister announced his generous provisions, the increases have been wiped out by major increases in the cost of food, fuel, light and gas.  People on low incomes are finding life very difficult.  Every time they go to the shop or supermarket, they find there has been an increase in the cost of foodstuffs.  The Minister must do something to help these people before the summer.  The increased payments they received, while generous, do not cover the increases in costs and they are feeling the pinch.  I am disappointed by that.</P>
        <P>I support Deputy Deenihan on the matter of the CWOs.  The current system is working and should be left in place.  I will give an example.  On a Saturday evening a month ago I was contacted by a person who had a hospital appointment in Dublin.  The HSE refused to bring the person to the hospital despite the fact the person was in very bad health.  This person had cancelled a previous appointment because he could not afford to attend.  I contacted the manager of the community welfare office on the Saturday evening about the case and he contacted me later to say the person could go ahead and bring the bill to the community welfare officer on Monday where it would be dealt with.  This person got very bad news when he attended the hospital.  He had to deal with the stress and pressure of not having the resources to keep the appointment and almost failed to keep it because of his lack of <Col N="49"/>resources.  If the community welfare officer was not available, there would have been no point in ringing Sligo.  I challenge the Minister to ring the Sligo office, or the Letterkenny office or the Donegal office, now or at 2.15 p.m. or 2.30 p.m.  I will tell him the response he will get &mdash; Mr. and Mrs. Voicemail.  That is all he will get; he will get no answers.  The only time one gets answers from the Department of Social and Family Affairs is when one tables a parliamentary question.  I compliment the Department in that regard.  It is good at that, but it is not good otherwise.</P>
        <P>What is this daft proposal of swipecards for the elderly which the Minister is now proposing?  This is an attack on the most vulnerable and weak.  It is a scandal.  It is also an attack on rural post offices.  The Minister is now proposing that if the Department provides a person with a swipecard and the person does not collect his or her money within 12 days, when he or she comes with the swipecard to collect on the 13th day the computer will show that there is no money there for him or her.  What if that person is in hospital?  What if that person is sick?  What if that person has nobody to collect that money for him or her?  The Minister will state it is a means tested payment, but there are many elderly persons in rural Ireland who cannot get to the post office because there is no rural transport and the Minister and his Department have failed to introduce a voucher to allow them use taxis.  In a few minutes the Dublin Deputies will defend the Minister.  Why would they not defend him, given that their constituents have DART, Luas and Dublin Bus?  People in Dublin have everything while we in rural Ireland have nothing.</P>
        <P>The Government has taken away the quality of life in rural Ireland.  The people used be able to go to the pub.  They can no longer do so because they are now being met by garda&iacute;.  Due to every kind of regulation, they cannot even go out on a Friday or Saturday night for a drink because they are afraid.  If they do not get them at night-time, they will be waiting to get them in the morning.  They have attacked and destroyed rural life.</P>
        <P>Why is it now necessary to introduce the swipecard to which I referred earlier, and why is the Department not out checking the people who are defrauding the State of rent allowance?  The Department should get out and attack the people who are defrauding the State, not the innocent people who cannot collect their pensions for one reason or another.  I ask the Minister to get rid of that daft regulation immediately.</P>
        <P>I heard Deputy Deenihan speak of pensions.  A man who came into my clinic last week has worked for 50 years.  For 42 years that man worked for an employer and he paid his full contributions.  For eight years he was self-employed.  He became of pension age last week.  He did not get a full contributory pension &mdash; he got 98% of it.  That is a scandal.  That is an anomaly in the social welfare system.</P><Col N="50"/>
        <P>In 1988, people such as farmers who never paid a contribution in their lives were allowed into a system where they paid contributions for ten years as self-employed persons and became entitled to a full contributory pension.  That is an anomaly with which the Minister must deal.  There are five or six persons known to me in my constituency who have worked over a 30 or 40 year period and, because there were gaps in their record of contributions, they do not get a full contributory pension.  There is a man who worked over a 50 year period and who paid stamps for approximately 30 years, but, because there was a gap, the Department calculated his contributions over the 50 years.  This meant he got only a percentage of a full contributory pension.  This affects very few people and I ask the Minister to investigate this matter immediately.</P>
        <P>I was disappointed with the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  When the Bill was announced last week, I expected that we would see something done about a refuse service waiver for persons on social welfare.  I hoped the Minister would include such a waiver in the household benefits package because a serious situation is developing among all local authorities.  Incidentally, maybe we should look at getting rid of them because they are unable to run the service or do their job any longer.  It appears that they cannot run a refuse service even though they were able to pick the cream of the people from whom to collect it.  Every one of them is telling us that they are losing money.</P>
        <P>These are the same officials in the local authorities who are putting levies on business, people who apply for planning permission and others.  All that is wrong with these officials in the local authorities is that they never worked a day in their lives outside the public service and they do not know how to make a euro, to make a profit and to pay staff.  They get their cheques on a Friday evening no matter what happens and they are the ones who are lecturing the private sector on how they may do business.</P>
        <P>The people are angry.  They are getting sick and tired of the levies and charges which are paying for benchmarking for local authority staff.  They are no longer able to continue in business.  People are telling me on a daily basis that they have had enough and are getting out.  It is not good for the country when small businesses and enterprises trying to create employment and provide a service in rural areas are being wiped out by the State.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not introduce a waiver scheme for the elderly on &euro;200 a week who must pay &euro;300, &euro;400 or &euro;500 per year to get their refuse taken away.  It is not acceptable and something must be done.  I raised the matter at the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs where I brought in the officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It cannot go on.  The Minister cannot give social welfare increases of &euro;16 or &euro;17 <Col N="51"/>a week and expect these people to pay &euro;20 or &euro;30 per week to have their refuse collected.  Something must be done immediately and I ask the Minister to deal with this problem.</P>
        <P>There is a social welfare top-up scheme for people who have children attending third level.  I raised this matter previously and I ask the Minister and the Department to look at it.  There is a cut-off point for a person on social welfare who has one child and if a person goes over that cut-off point, he or she does not quality for the social welfare top-up.  A constituent of mine on social welfare has three children at third level and because they exceed that cut-off point, they do not get the top-up.  His wife works a few hours and that, together with his social welfare, puts them over the cut-off point for this scheme.</P>
        <P>Why not operate this scheme like the third level grant, where, if one has one child, two children or three children, the Department increases the threshold which allows them into the system?  As the scheme operates at present, there is a certain point at which one is cut off, irrespective of whether a person has one, two, three or four children at third level.  People on social welfare who have children at third level are finding it very difficult.  The Minister should look at this scheme immediately, particularly before we reach September when people who have children entering third level will apply for the top-up and will find it is a difficult time for them.  This good scheme helps people on social welfare, but it is wrong that there is no disregard available for those who have a second or third child, and that such people are not given any increase for them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister might respond to me about the telephone allowance on which there was a number of announcements.  Is the scheme whereby a person can get free mobile telephone units in place?  This is approximately the 36th time this scheme has been announced by the Government.  Before the local elections the Minister announced it ten times; before the last general election the Minister did so approximately 15 times and, in between, the Minister has certainly done it ten or 12 times.  Will he tell me whether that scheme is in place and give me a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer?  The press officer in the Minister&rsquo;s office is a great man for re-spinning.  There are those who are good at spinning, but his man is good at re-spinning continuously.  He is from County Mayo and he is a good fellow.  Anyone from there is good and I will not hold that against him.  No doubt he is spinning it out on a regular basis.  In any case, I want to know what is the position in that regard.</P>
        <P>What plans has the Minister to introduce a taxi voucher for the elderly, particularly to enhance the quality of life in rural Ireland?  As these people are eligible for the free schemes, they possess the free travel pass.</P>

        <P>Does the Minister or the Department propose introducing a taxi voucher?  Is he looking at doing so?  The Minister will state that there is a considerable cost factor involved and it would take up the time of a large number of staff, but I saw the amount of money in the Estimates for computers and that raises the following question for the Minister and his officials.  Are these computers working or is the Department just installing them one year and taking them out the next?  Do they work?  Is the Department unable to programme them?  There is more money every year for computers, yet the Department cannot put together a simple scheme whereby those entitled to free travel can use a voucher scheme in rural Ireland.</P>
    
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, which gives legislative effect and implements some of the social welfare changes in budget 2007.  I refer specifically to the one-parent family payment, child benefit and the respite care grant.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I compliment the Minister on his work to date, not necessarily on the spending but on some of the fundamental changes.  Too often we stress the increases that are made.  We should acknowledge that the Minister has tried to address some of the anomalies and poverty traps in the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that the social welfare budget for this year is in excess of &euro;15 billion.  One in three euro is spent on social welfare and this comprises a substantial increase over last year&rsquo;s expenditure.  It is therefore worth examining the level of spending.  Over 1 million people benefit directly from social welfare or, if one takes their dependants into account, 1.5 million.  The scale is therefore quite substantial.</P>
        <P>I take issue with Deputy Ring who said there are major increases in food, fuel and electricity prices.  He is correct that there were fuel price increases, including in the cost of gas, but the Government and Minister in particular have introduced steps to alleviate them on a number of occasions.  Such steps include the increase in the fuel allowance from &euro;14 to &euro;18 and the additional free units.  It is incorrect to say people are now worse off.  The rate of social welfare increases far exceeds the rate of inflation.  Some of the increases amount to &euro;20 per week.  It is incorrect for Deputy Ring to argue the effect of the increases has been wiped out.  It may partly be the case but people are now better off than they were before the increases were made.  It is unfair to argue that the increases, which were the most significant ever, are not benefiting their recipients; it is simply not the case.</P><Col N="53"/>
        <P>Let us consider the main changes in the social welfare system.  It is worth reiterating that the target set by the Government regarding old age pensions was achieved.  Following this year&rsquo;s budget, the contributory old age pension has increased to &euro;209 and the non-contributory old age pension has increased to &euro;200.  Approximately 400,000 pensioners stand to benefit from the increases.  Earnings for non-contributory pensioners have been doubled to &euro;200 per week.  The means disregard for the non-contributory pension has increased by &euro;10 per week to &euro;30, which benefits approximately 25,000 people.  Significant changes have therefore been made.</P>
        <P>The increase in the fuel allowance should be considered in the context of the additional units that were made available.  I found it hard to listen to Deputy Ring&rsquo;s comments that all the benefits have been wiped out.  He spoke about the increased cost of living and food prices, but the reality is that CSO figures on price increases do not match what he said.  His comments were incorrect.</P>
        <P>One must acknowledge the increase in child benefit, which increased by &euro;10 in respect of both categories.  One must also acknowledge the other changes that benefit children, including the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which is used quite a lot during the summer.</P>
        <P>The wider eligibility for the family income supplement is welcome.  It is complicated to get people to engage in this issue and there is a real problem in that many eligible citizens do not avail of the supplement.  However, it makes a real difference to those who receive it and it affords them the opportunity to re-enter the workforce.  I do not know why all those who are potentially eligible for the supplement do not seem to get it.  I have discussed this at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and with officials from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  We are missing the target with the supplement by a sizeable margin, which is regrettable.  The scheme is very beneficial and positive but, for some reason, we are not getting through to all those who should and would benefit therefrom.</P>
        <P>Over the past decade the role of carers has changed significantly and the commitment and support they have received from the Government has increased.  The weekly payments to carers have been increased greatly and the qualifying conditions for the carer&rsquo;s allowance have also changed.  There are 28,000 or 29,000 carers and their allowances have increased.  Carers often tell me the respite care grant, which is made by way of a single payment in the summer, is very beneficial and gives them a range of options.  The increase this year from &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,500 is very welcome.  In addition to carers, a group of approximately 10,000 people qualifies for the grant.  It represents a very good initiative and the money can be used for practical purposes.  The Minister will be surprised to hear what people are doing with their grants.</P><Col N="54"/>
        <P>From September of this year, those in receipt of certain other welfare payments who also provide full-time care will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another, subject to a means test, amounting to up to half the rate of the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  For the first time, this will abolish the rule whereby one could not receive two welfare payments.  Apart from the financial benefit and supports that this measure makes possible, it recognises the role of carers.  It is not always a question of increases as one must also consider the direction of policy and support.  An important step has been taken to recognise the role of carers and provide them with real support.</P>
        <P>The family income supplement concerns lone parents in particular, as I note in my busy constituency office.  If lone parents try to re-enter the workforce while in private rented accommodation, their rent supplement is cut, after which they must obtain the family income supplement to compensate.  This seems to be cumbersome and comprises a somewhat vicious circle.  Lone parents are entitled to the benefits but they do not seem to be joined up very easily.  There should be a better process such that when they apply for the family income supplement, a social welfare officer could sit down with them and examine the cumulative effects.  Rather than having to make many applications and changes, the applicant&rsquo;s social welfare officer should state he or she will be entitled to a specified family income supplement and a general package.  At present, the benefits are granted on a standalone basis.  The system is quite complicated and perhaps this is why people are not applying for the family income supplement.</P>
        <P>It is important that the rent supplement does not increase the price of rented accommodation in the Dublin market.  At present it needs to be reviewed because it is simply insufficient to match Dublin market prices and cover costs.  This is proving to be a problem.  I raise this issue reluctantly because I am conscious the rate specified by the Department can drive the market.  Families who rent properties for &euro;1,200, of which they receive a percentage in rent allowance, are being told when landlords raise the rent to either renegotiate or find alternative accommodation.  However, they are often unable to find alternative accommodation in the same price category, with the result that many have to make up the difference by paying cash from their payments.  This is somewhat of a bind but I do not know when the figures will be reviewed.</P>
        <P>Certain categories, such as single people and lone parents, seem to face greater difficulties in terms of renting properties and are struggling to find accommodation.  A review of property prices in Dublin is needed because we are in danger of returning to the black economy.  Individuals are paying a proportion of their rent in cash because they are not eligible for anything if they tell the social welfare office their rent is higher than the <Col N="55"/>guide price.  I raise this issue reluctantly because I am aware of the effect of increases in the rent supplement in terms of driving rents up.  However, over the past several months, I have encountered increasing numbers of people who are struggling because of their dependence on rent allowances.</P>
        <P>An anomaly has arisen in respect of the contributory State pension.  The people who are now reaching the pension age of 66 worked in a very different era.  When women had children, for example, they had few options other than to leave employment.  To qualify for the minimum contributory State pension, an average of ten payments is required based on a retirement age of 66.  If a person began work at the age of 16 or 18 and made 400 contributions over eight years, the period would be 50 years and the average would be eight payments.  However, if the same person worked over a 40 year period, the average would be ten payments.  Therefore, depending on when they started work, two individuals who worked for eight years and paid 400 contributions might not both qualify for the minimum level.  One person might qualify for the minimum level with an average of ten payments because the 400 contributions are divided by a working life of 40 years.  However, the person who left school at the age of 16 does not qualify because the average is divided by 50.  The issue, which was brought to my attention recently by one of my constituents, appears unfair and anomalous and I ask the Minister to investigate it further.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ring spoke about computerisation.  It is important that the Department of Social and Family Affairs develops close links with the Revenue Commissioners.  I am aware of two cases of social welfare recipients who returned to the workforce but continued to receive lone parent&rsquo;s allowance despite paying PAYE and PRSI.  The payments continued over a number of years, with the result that the women are now repaying more than &euro;20,000.  Even though the women are unknown to each other, neither could understand why the Department did not know they were paying taxes.  They did not distinguish between the Department and the Revenue Commissioners but regarded them collectively as the State.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge their responsibility to keep the Department informed but, given that tax was being taken from them, they could not understand why the relevant information was not automatically shared.  While there may be limits in terms of data protection legislation, that type of automatic transfer of information should be in place in this age of computerisation to protect social welfare recipients, who are often not fully aware of their obligations, from building up overpayments.  The women concerned honestly believed that the Department and the Revenue Commissioners had integrated communications in place.</P><Col N="56"/>
        <P>I am aware the Department investigates fraud, which is important because people who fraudulently acquire social welfare payments take from those who really need the money.  Officials in the Department should be complimented in that regard.  However, it is worth investigating the issue from the point of view of building practical working relationships with other providers, such as local authorities and the Garda, so that information can be shared in a timely manner.  We have all received anecdotal evidence of these issues but structured procedures should be established because, while my constituents regularly warn me when someone receives fraudulent payments, it would appear that other providers have similar information.  However, the operations by which the Department detects fraud are better left unexplained.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on the reforms he has made in terms of removing poverty traps and anomalies.  I note in particular the extension of the free travel scheme on an all-island basis.  Although the scheme is funded by the Department for Social and Family Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was also interested in it as an element in the peace process.  It is welcome that it will be introduced over the next couple of months.  I understand people must apply for the scheme but, from the point of view of a changing Ireland, it is a welcome development.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It will be my last time to speak on Second Stage of a Social Welfare and Pensions Bill until, I hope, I return to the House after the next general election.  I take this opportunity to thank the staff of social welfare offices for the service they provide for the public and have provided for me since my election to the House.  It is a testament to them, be they located in Sligo or Longford, etc., that I am seldom obliged to table a parliamentary question on such issues.  While social welfare issues arise, I am usually able to rectify them by telephone or through correspondence.  I thank the diligent staff.</P>
        <P>In respect of the last point made by the previous speaker on pension anomalies, all Members have encountered such cases.  I am familiar with an extreme example and although I had not intended raising it, as other Members have discussed similar cases, I will follow suit.  Like others, one of my constituents had worked for most of his life and paid his stamps and contributions.  However, three or four contributions were made early in his life.  He intended to apply for the old age pension and before his birthday, I acquired a list of his contributions to calculate the <Col N="57"/>averages.  After so doing, it became clear that he would not qualify for the full pension owing to the payment of three or four stamps early in his life.  I investigated the matter and was advised that he had worked for the local authority one summer.  I contacted the local authority and received a letter in reply stating it had not paid any stamps on his behalf, although it had done so for someone with a similar name.  I forwarded the letter to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and it was not accepted.  Consequently, I intend to provide the Minister with the details of the case.  As the local authority has stated it did not make a contribution for this man and the few contributions in question are debarring him from receiving a full pension, he should receive it.  This is a relatively straightforward case.</P>
        <P>I agree with previous speakers that there are several cases in which people fail to receive a full pension because a small number of contributions were made early in their lives.  The number of such persons is reducing continually and I ask the Minister to form a group to consider this issue.  People are of the opinion that they should be entitled to a full pension after working for 30 or 40 years and I agree.  The system based on averages with which Members deal is outmoded and should be replaced.</P>
        <P>I will take up another point raised by the previous speaker in respect of rent supplements.  While this may be an issue in Dublin, it is also an issue in my constituency where the figures for rent allowance do not cover the cost of rented property.  I represent towns such as Killarney, Dingle and Kenmare, in which many properties can command high rents during the summer letting season.  Tenants who are not prepared to pay might be put out of their houses before Easter and few houses become available subsequently until the following October, after the summer season ends.  It is extremely difficult to deal with people in this context.  Community welfare officers also find it difficult because although they have guidelines, people are unable to find houses to rent within them.  They are in the black economy, may not be telling the truth and issues may arise, whereby a great deal of money must be paid back.  Were the Minister to decide to review the figures in respect of rent allowance, it should be done on a countrywide basis, not simply for Dublin, as difficulties are also being experienced in my constituency of Kerry South.  The same is true of other constituencies in which there is a tourism element.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of women who were affected by the marriage bar.  I have met a number of such women in recent years and they feel aggrieved that through no fault of their own, they are not entitled to a pension when reaching pensionable age.  Moreover, the amount they receive as an adult dependant is reduced if their husbands are in receipt of a pension.  I welcome the introduction, from September, of direct payments to qualified adults.  However, this measure <Col N="58"/>will not make such individuals any better off.  Women whose husbands have not been giving them any money might be better off, but not otherwise.  Those women who stayed at home, looked after their children and could not work have a case.  The State is discriminating against them because through no fault of their own, they have no entitlement to a payment in their own right.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to another group of women.  I am moving on because my time is short and I wish to cover a number of issues.  I refer to widows who are in receipt of a widow&rsquo;s pension and who also receive disability benefit.  Should such women fall ill, they are only entitled to half-rate disability benefit for 15 months.  I have encountered two cases in which widows who were extremely ill were given the money for 15 months.  Thereafter, the rug was pulled from under them and payment was stopped.  Payments to a widow should continue until such time as she recovers. One does not recover from all illnesses within 15 months.  Unfortunately, some people never get better, while others do.  It should be the responsibility of the consultant or doctor to provide a certificate to the effect that the person in question is unfit to return to work.  Although many widows work, if they fall ill, they will receive a half-rate disability benefit payment for 15 months.  I ask the Minister to consider this issue which should be based on medical evidence.  If a widow is not better after 15 months, payments should continue until she has recovered.  This is not an unreasonable request.</P>
        <P>I support other Members who have spoken about community welfare officers.  No Member, of any party or none, will state the proposal to transfer community welfare officers to the Department of Social and Family Affairs is a good idea.  It is a disastrous idea because while the Minister may mean well, it will not work.  When the service comes under the aegis of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, it will be obliged to follow guidelines.  However, when Frank Cluskey first introduced it, the element of discretion was of greatest importance.  All Members have stories about clients who were able to contact community welfare officers out of hours.  Such officers deal with people in a holistic manner and know them, their families and neighbours.  As they work on the ground, they are able to spot the cases that are not genuine.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister not to disturb the existing system.  I fear that many issues dealt with by community welfare officers at present will not be dealt with by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Consequently, people, including children, will fall between two stools and be left in terrible circumstances.  People in difficulties who approach a politician are able to go to the community welfare officer.  No major form-filling or large structure are involved and it is a highly personal matter.  I appeal to the Minister not to disturb the existing system, as it works very well. <Col N="59"/> While I am unsure who wishes to change it, it is not for a good reason.</P>

        <Quest> the way he will ensure that there is an adequate number of buses in the greater Dublin area; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 provides for a programme of investment to fund increased radial and orbital bus services in the Dublin area.  The target is to achieve in the period up to 2015 a 60% increase in passenger carrying capacity through new and replacement bus acquisition.  Dublin Bus is bringing into service the 100 additional buses for which Exchequer funding of &euro;30 million was approved in September last.  This will bring the total Dublin Bus fleet to 1,182 buses, up from approximately 900 in 1997.</P>
        <P>The capacity of the Dublin Bus fleet, taking into account the 100 additional buses recently purchased, is now more than 106,000 passengers.  This is an increase of more than 45% on the 2000 capacity.  This increase reflects the fact that many of the replacement buses purchased over this period were of higher capacity than the smaller, single decker buses being replaced.  Over the same period Dublin Bus passenger numbers grew from 137 million to 146 million per annum, an increase of 7%.</P>
        <P>The need for additional buses over and above the 100 being brought into service will be considered in the legislation being prepared to replace the Road Transport Act 1932.  The proposed legislation will, <i>inter alia</i>, address the precise arrangements for the award of franchises to private operators in the Dublin market in line with my announcement of September last.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I realise this was not an original question.  However, I hoped for an original answer.  The Minister knows as well as I that traffic conditions in Dublin deteriorate daily and will continue to do so in the short to medium term with the building of various transport projects such as metro and Luas, the intensification of work on the M50 and growth in the economy and population.  The general growth in and desire <Col N="60"/>for mobility means transport conditions can only deteriorate.</P>
        <P>The truth of the matter is that we have had 100 extra buses in the past few months, not all of which are in operation.  This means that in the past five years we had an average of 20 extra buses per year.  This does not begin to deal with existing demand, never mind the growth we saw in the past ten years.  The Minister referred to radial routes.  Bus lanes are underutilised by buses.  The Minister suggests that because we have 100 more buses, the service will somehow improve.  It disimproves daily and the evidence is before our eyes.</P>
        <P>The Minister promised the DTA would be established, liberalisation of the bus market and that the private sector would be invited to provide additional buses.  We were promised this before this term started.  We are now promised it will happen before the end of the D&aacute;il term.  Will it happen?  Is it true the Taoiseach is firmly set against it and has decided it will not happen because it would step on too many toes?  If it is to happen, will the Minister tell us when, even in an interim form?  I understand the Taoiseach thinks it is in operation.  Will the Minister clarify when it will come into operation, when the legislation will be published and passed and when buses will begin to be put on the streets of Dublin?  It is the only real measure that can be taken in the short term.</P>

	<P>I do not agree that traffic conditions are worsening on a daily basis.  As Deputy Mitchell knows, since the port tunnel opened, traffic in and around the centre of Dublin and on the north side of the city has improved.  I was pleased to hear from Dublin Bus that the speed ratio on its routes from the north side to the centre of the city had increased.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The naysayers and doomsayers stated the M50 would close down when the port tunnel opened.  Equally, this has proven not to be the case.  I accept there are transport issues which must be dealt with and I am happy to state we are dealing with them.  I saw the Dublin Bus plans for the new buses to be provided which are being maximised on green routes from suburbs to the centre of Dublin.  The QBCs will carry many more buses.  As the Deputy knows, we want to expand the number of QBCs.</P>
        <P>Another 160 buses were provided for Bus &Eacute;ireann, many of which will operate in the greater Dublin area outside the Dublin suburbs and bring many more passengers from towns to <Col N="61"/>the centre of Dublin.  The capacity of the bus fleet in Dublin has increased by 45%.  I am glad Dublin Bus maximised its use and is now busily putting in place the route selection process for the new and additional buses.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy.  I am anxious to have more buses in the Dublin bus market.  As the Deputy knows, I have substantial resources available under Transport 21.  We intend to increase bus capacity by more than 60%.  The bus will remain the workhorse in the public transport system, as it is in almost every other country.  This measure will be joined by seven Luas projects, metro north, metro west and the interconnector for all DART services.  In the past year all DART services were expanded to eight-car services, which has meant a dramatic improvement in capacity on DART services.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to roll out more buses with both the public and private sectors and continue to grow the bus market in the Dublin area.  We began that process with 100 buses and 160 have gone to Bus &Eacute;ireann, many of which will be used in the surrounding towns which now form part of the greater Dublin area on commuter runs to the city centre.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present, such as in bulk and trainload traffic.  The company has also sought to return the rail freight business to profitability.  To help achieve this turnaround, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann withdrew from loss-making groupage, palletised and single container rail transport resulting in the deficit on rail freight being reduced by 50% in the past three years.</P>
        <P>Since 1999, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has invested over &euro;1.6 billion in rebuilding the railways, with Government and EU support for the investment programme.  This has delivered improvements in new trains, upgraded infrastructure and customer facilities.  Although such investment has primarily focused on improving passenger services, where the need is greater and the demand strongest, the investment in improving rail infrastructure also has a direct beneficial impact on freight activities.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has made progress in growing the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, such as large volumes or trainloads over long distances.  For example, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has reintroduced the trainload pulpwood business by modifying surplus wagons and providing additional services for Coillte between the west and the south east.</P>
        <P>It has altered rail schedules and is currently providing three additional trains per week for Tara mines, with a potential to carry an extra 85,000 tonnes of lead and zinc between Navan and Dublin Port per annum.  It has modified surplus platform wagons to provide a trainload service for containers between Ballina and Waterford Port.</P><Col N="63"/>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has undertaken extensive engagement with industry and transporters around the country to try to identify long-term sustainable business opportunities.  It has had genuine difficulty in identifying opportunities that offer reasonable volumes of business on a regular basis.  It is not feasible to run trains with one or two containers and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has not identified sufficient business, with the exception of the Ballina to Waterford stream, to group a number of separate activities together to form a viable load.</P>
        <P>Most industry is focused on &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; transport and as our road network continues to expand and improve across the country, the role of rail freight becomes more problematic because all rail journeys involve road movements at each end of the logistics chain.  Furthermore, in Ireland, distances are short.  The experience across Europe is no different.  Rail freight activities are most economic where distances are long, where there are large volumes to be transported and where the freight to be carried is not time-sensitive.</P>
        <P>As part of the engagement with industry, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann works closely with port authorities, such as in Dublin relating to transport of lead and zinc and Waterford relating to container traffic, to increase rail-based freight.  The Government&rsquo;s ports policy statement recognises the need for the integration of ports as a fundamental link in the supply chain with other transport modes, including rail.</P>
   
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>In the absence of opportunities or proposals for viable long-term rail freight business, the development and use of fiscal incentives has not been considered.</P>
        <P>As regards a role for new market entrants to the rail freight business, I have introduced the European Communities (Access to Railway Infrastructure) (Amendment) Regulations 2005, SI 780 of 2005, implementing EU Directive 2004/51, on the development of the Community&rsquo;s railways.  These regulations open the freight market to competition from both domestic and foreign operators from 1 January 2006 in the case of international freight, and from 1 January 2007 in the case of domestic freight operations.  To date, no serious representations have been made to my Department for entry to the market.</P>
        <P>I am open to any views on how we can expand rail freight but the business environment is such that real opportunities have not been presented to me.  The market for rail freight is now fully liberalised and if there are promoters who have identified opportunities I would welcome expressions of interest.</P>
   </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister began his reply by stating that Iarn&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann continues to grow the <Col N="64"/>rail freight business, which is patently untrue.  The figures over the past few years indicate a 28% decline in rail freight in 2005, with a 47% decline last year.  The business has virtually disappeared, with approximately 0.5% of freight now carried by rail.  The Minister should stop codding himself and us.  Nothing has happened to support rail freight or encourage its greater usage in the past few years.  The opposite has been the case, with a dramatic decline becoming evident.</P>
        <P>I asked what Government policy on rail freight is and if the Minister has any proposals for incentivising rail freight.  Looking at the rest of Europe, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland have incentive schemes to encourage the use of rail freight.</P>
        <P>The Minister is operating on the basis that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has a very limited budget, with its emphasis rightly being on passenger services.  It does not have the resources to try to expand the rail freight business.  This does not stack up.  I listed the countries which have incentive schemes but does the Minister have any proposals for an incentive scheme to encourage a switch from road to rail?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>When it comes to it, that is further down the line.</P>
        <P>From 1 January this year, all domestic freight operations in this country have become an open market which has been fully deregulated.  To date, no serious representations have been made to my Department to enter into the market.  I have requested the private sector, if it so wishes, to come into the market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not as long as the Minister is still there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Some private sector companies have considered the move but the big difficulty in Ireland is that distances are very short and end-to-end points do not have huge business at either end.  This is the reality here and in Europe.  Freight movements on trains are more successful in Europe where they are over long distances.</P>
        <P>In fairness to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Norfolkline, a major international shipping company, put a proposal to it for the movement of freight across this country.  It came on board with a joint venture and worked it through.  Unfortunately, it failed completely because of the private sector costs, including trying to get the goods to the station.  They had to hire trucks to get the goods there.  There was also the cost of putting goods on and off trains, which meant the operation was not viable.</P>
        <P>The private sector, which is very experienced in shipping and operating rail systems in Europe, came to the conclusion that, given the configuration in Ireland, it was not viable because of the cost base of moving much freight by rail.  It was significantly different to do so by road.  That is the reality of using rail freight in this country.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has maximised its benefit in some specialised bulk cargoes, which it is growing, and some specific long loads of container traffic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very disingenuous of the Minister to try to score cheap political points.  He knows perfectly well that the road system is highly subsidised by the taxpayer.  He should also know that the cost to the taxpayer of road freight is very high.  If we lose the remaining tiny proportion of freight currently travelling by rail, it will cost the taxpayer some &euro;36 million a year.  That has been fully costed and refers to wear and tear on the roads, not to mind the increased likelihood of accidents or the environmental impacts of having more HGVs travelling through residential areas.</P>
        <P>Almost every other country in Europe subsidises the operation of rail freight.  I asked the Minister if he had a policy and he clearly has none.  He has spoken about opening up the market but there was no interest.  There is no interest because it does not stack up unless all the <Col N="66"/>costs are included.  We can look at internal costs but the Minister and his Government should also take into account external costs.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister be proactive in this area and end the hands-off approach?  We have a serious problem with the amount of freight carried on our roads and we are paying a heavy cost for it.</P>

        <Quest> the measure he will take to reduce the increasing greenhouse gas emissions for the transport sector here; and his views on whether the current rate of 8% annual increase in emissions will make it difficult for Ireland to comply with the stated European Union target of at least a 20% cut in emissions from 1990 base levels by 2020. </Quest>
        <QRef>[6804/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am implementing a number of policies and measures that will deliver a sustainable transport system, including the provision of supply-side infrastructure and demand-side management measures to reduce congestion and support a modal shift from private to public transport.  This will allow the economy to maintain economic competitiveness by removing infrastructural bottlenecks, while increasing social cohesion and reducing environmental impacts.</P>
        <P>Transport 21, a &euro;34 billion capital investment framework for the period 2006-15, will promote the modal shift from private cars to public transport through the significant rebalancing of investment in favour of the latter.  A total of &euro;18.5 billion will be invested in the national roads programme, while &euro;15.8 billion will be provided for public transport projects and regional airports.  Funding for a range of sustainable transport initiatives is also provided for under Transport 21, including the dissemination of information on eco-driving and travel blending, as well as support for alternative fuels and technologies for public transport, haulage and taxi fleets.</P>
        <P>The completion of projects identified in Transport 21 will, for example, see public transport capacity in the greater Dublin area almost double by 2016.  Modelling of the impacts of Transport 21 in that area with the complementary implementation of demand-side management measures shows a reduction of almost 20% in fuel consumption and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions during rush hour in 2016 compared to a situation without Transport 21.</P><Col N="68"/>
        <P>I have requested my Department to draft a sustainable transport action plan for consultation this year.  This will support the Government&rsquo;s revised climate change strategy and energy White Paper due to be published in the coming weeks.  The plan will set out a range of measures to assist the transport sector&rsquo;s progress along a more sustainable path and make a critical contribution to reducing emissions in line with Ireland&rsquo;s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol in the period 2008-12 and beyond.</P>
        <P>I am working to achieve emissions reductions in the public transport fleet.  I have requested CIE to move to using a 5% bio-diesel blend in its current vehicles and to plan for a 30% blend in new vehicles.  My Department is also supporting a pilot project in conjunction with the German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce to promote the use of 100% pure plant oil, PPO, in heavy goods vehicles and buses.  These measures, together with excise relief and obligatory fuel blending by fuel suppliers in 2009, will contribute to achieving the indicative biofuels target of 5.75% of all transport fuels by 2010 as set out in the biofuels directive.</P>
        <P>In addition, technological advances within the automotive industry will be important in bringing more fuel efficient vehicles to market.  Ireland supports the current proposals to achieve a reduction of average emissions in new passenger cars to 130 grams per kilometre by 2012.  Tackling transport emissions will remain a key priority of mine.  I will continue to promote measures to ensure the transport sector makes its contribution to reducing national greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

	<P>The Minister is not following a transport policy that will lead to a reduction in emissions.  Instead, the State agency Sustainable Energy Ireland has set out detailed research on what is happening and where we are going.  It predicts that by 2020 transport emissions will have increased by 46% on top of the 156% increase in the past 15 years.  The Minister&rsquo;s record is one of utter failure in the past and preparing for failure in the future.</P>
        <P>The debate on climate change has a moral dimension in that our emissions are killing people on the other side of the planet.  Why is the Government failing in its basic moral duty by planning to increase emissions to such an extent that they will kill people?  For this reason, the policy is dishonest.  It is more than nonsense because &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; is the wrong word.</P>

How will the Government meet the reduction target of 20% below 1990 levels, 45% below current levels, when emissions will increase by another 45% under the Minister&rsquo;s stewardship?  How can he combine those figures and give me an honest answer?</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Green Party has consistently opposed the planning of almost every major piece of infrastructure.  In the context of the country&rsquo;s development, I do not adhere to the backward-looking position taken by the Green Party.  As a former Minister for the Environment and Local Government and as the Minister for Transport, I adhere to a balance between the environment and the economy.  I told the House with confidence that we would achieve our targets by 2010 under the EU biofuels directive.  We have set out to achieve our targets and many public companies and the private sector support us.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has not mentioned our considerable investment in public transport.  Almost half of the &euro;34 billion will be invested in light rail, metro and heavy rail systems.  In the context of the electrification extension of the DART system, the construction of the interconnector will make a significant contribution to the reduction of emissions, which the Deputy knows and chooses to ignore.  This will be followed by expanding the <Col N="70"/>rail network, restoring the western rail corridor, providing new commuter routes to Cork and Galway and examining extensive feasibility studies for Limerick and other cities.  While the Deputy discusses these matters without contributing anything positive in terms of maintaining a balanced economy and competitiveness&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government wasted ten years doing none of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;we will take care of them, but we will not do so at the expense of undermining Ireland&rsquo;s position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the European and world economies.  We will balance the serious environmental agenda, to which my colleagues in government and I subscribe, in a way that sustains Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness in the global economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want a simple answer to my next questions.  Does the Minister believe we will be able to meet our European target of reducing emissions to 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 and how does he equate this with the State&rsquo;s predictions that our emissions will be 45% greater by 2020?  I cannot believe there is still a Minister who is of the view that there is a choice between the economic and environmental balances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The whole world believes it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The economy is a subset of the environment, not <i>vice versa</i>.  If we do not have a planet, there will be no economy.  That is the scale of the challenge in the climate change issue.  Even if one considers economics alone, the Minister&rsquo;s solution of significant growth in transport emissions will cost the Irish people considerably more because the rest of the world&rsquo;s population will not look on and say, &ldquo;In fairness to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, Ireland must look after its economy&rdquo;.  The world will charge us for the excess emissions caused by the Minister which will cost us as taxpayers dearly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows that most countries are reducing their emissions by building nuclear power stations, but that would not sit well with the Green Party which wants it every way.</P>

	<P>We will not devastate the economy and create mass unemployment to reach our targets, which is all that the Green Party offers.

	<P>Transport 21 provides unprecedented capital investment for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s transport system over the period to 2015.  This investment will transform both the national road and public transport networks.</P>
        <P>It will deliver faster, safer and more reliable journeys on our national road network.  It will lead to a doubling of public transport capacity in the greater Dublin area.  It will result in increased service frequency and reliability on our rail network.  It will deliver better public transport services in our regions.</P>
        <P>The investment programme being funded by Transport 21 is based on an extensive and robust body of research and policy work, including the strategic rail review, the national roads needs study, the DTO&rsquo;s A Platform for Change and a number of regional land and transportation stud<Col N="72"/>ies.  It is supported by the technical and economic evaluations in those reports.  There are appraisal and monitoring structures in place that will ensure the maximum return will be derived from the investment involved.  All projects contained in Transport 21 have been or will be evaluated in accordance with the requirements of the guidelines for appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals and the value for money guidelines issued by the Department of Finance.  These comprehensive guidelines require the appraisal of the project at various stages from approval in principle to post project review.  My Department and the State agencies responsible for implementing Transport 21 projects will, of course, comply fully with the guidelines.</P>
        <P>In addition, I have established a monitoring group, comprising representatives of a number of Departments, to oversee progress on Transport 21.  The group will satisfy itself that proper procedures are being followed in the appraisal, management and post project review of projects.  In this regard, a tender process is nearing completion to engage auditors to provide independent assessments of the appraisals carried out on a selected number of projects.  Audits will also be carried out on the physical and financial progress of selected projects under consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister is saying as regards unprecedented investment.  That is not in question.  I am concerned as to whether we are getting value for money for this unprecedented investment.  There has never been a shortage of inputs in recent years.  The question is whether we are getting the output we should be getting.  Given the scale of promised investment and the returns on existing investment, one really has to ask this question.  The port tunnel has cost the best part of &euro;1 billion, for example, and the volume of traffic is between 6,000 and 8,000 vehicles a day while its capacity must be close to 150,000 per day.  It will never grow very much beyond that level.  The idea is not to pour traffic into the city and certainly not much more can be diverted onto the M50, so who precisely will use the tunnel?  There are no buses in it, and of course there are none to put in it, even if someone was directing the usage of this tunnel.  Nobody is co-ordinating these matters, or ensuring the tunnel is used.  Earlier we spoke about rail freight and indeed already &euro;1.5 billion has been put into the rail network.  It is lying idle most of each day.</P>
        <P>The Minister gave Deputy Shortall an example to the effect the private sector had undercut Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  The reality is that the company&rsquo;s road haulage division undercut Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and that is how it lost that contract.  We were promised that the Phoenix Park tunnel, one of the best kept secrets, would be opened to bring traffic  from Heuston to Connolly Station and perhaps relieve some of the congestion on the quays when the metro work starts.  Now that is being <Col N="73"/>reneged on because it might interfere with the interconnector project.  Bus lanes are being built in jig-time.  Some of them are empty, without even one bus to be seen.  The school bus fleet is another area where there is enormous potential for increased output.  There is no co-ordination, co-operation or integration of services.  The result is that the synergies that should be available if someone was driving all these projects and ensuring they gave the best value for money, are just not happening in Dublin.  When are we going to have the Dublin transportation authority that could drive these projects?  Does the Minister accept we are getting less than optimal return as a result of not having such a body?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly do not.  I agree that in the early days of the investment programme, it was quite clear the construction sector and the systems that were in place were not geared to take the enormous volume of investment the State wanted to make.  There were problems in the early days in that regard, no doubt.  However, we are all very heartened by experience in the last few years, Ireland having developed the most formidable construction sector of any country across Europe.  Projects are all being delivered on budget and quite substantially ahead of schedule.  It is time we stopped knocking the agencies involved which comprise some very good people whom I have met in recent years and who are doing a fantastic job at all levels.  No one has the ideal panacea.  The solutions cannot be delivered overnight, but quite clearly I do not agree with the Deputy that this is not an integrated approach to the development of transport, both in Dublin and around the country.  A formidable, integrated transport solution is being presented.  Every month, almost, the integration is seen to be coming together for Dublin.  We see the completion of the Naas dual carriageway upgrade to three lanes in either direction, as well as the opening of the largest urban infrastructure tunnel ever built in Europe, the port tunnel, working very successfully.  Yes, we need the completion of the M50 upgrade which will increase capacity by 50%, and freeflow tolling.  The traffic coherence to be brought about when all those projects have been completed will work extremely well.  We are well advanced in our planning on metro north and as regards the Luas network.  The first new railway station, which only started last year, will be opened in Dublin next month, in the docklands.  It only physically started last year, so great credit is due to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for delivering a new railway station on that basis. </P>

	<P>That is fine and there is a big church in that group, but that does not bother me.  The fact is we are delivering and this is visible every day not just in Dublin, but across the country.  It is very interesting that public support from 2006 is fantastic for the developments in transport and the visible transformation of almost the country&rsquo;s entire landscape, including what is being done for communities through bypasses and returning economic and social quality of life to different areas on a weekly basis.  It is something this Government is committed to completing.  That is why I am the only Minister for Transport in Europe today who got a &euro;34 billion package, a ten year framework, who put in place a development plan that is clearly cohesive and got the financial resources to deliver the solutions.</P>
        <P>I have heard Members of the House talk about places in Europe, and Vancouver in Canada and I have spoken to people there and seen them all.  There is a very simple answer to this.  We are not backward in delivering in this country.  That is a simple statement of fact.  We should be proud of what many Irish men and women are doing as regards delivering infrastructure.</P>

        <Quest> the State is one of the major shareholders in Aer Lingus, his views on the recent industrial relations impasse at the airline and the possibility of an upcoming strike; if he has had discussions on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[6869/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s strategic interests in aviation are best served by the provision of regular, safe, cost-effective and competitive air services linking the country with key business and tourism markets around the world.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s main objective in selling a majority of its shareholding in Aer Lingus last year was to provide the company with access to new equity to enable it to compete effectively and to grow its business on short-haul and long-haul routes.  As a result of the proceeds generated by the IPO, Aer Lingus now has a unique opportunity to fulfil its potential and to contribute in a positive way to the country&rsquo;s economic development, in line with the Government&rsquo;s strategic objectives.</P>
        <P>The conduct of industrial relations is a matter for the company and the State&rsquo;s shareholding does not confer on me a direct role in this matter.  As Minister for Transport, I would be concerned that any disruption of services arising from industrial action would inconvenience the travelling public and could also have a negative impact on the economy.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, I hope the company and unions will ensure that industrial action, as outlined, is avoided and I encourage them to ensure it is.  It is understood that efforts are being made by management to resolve the issues in discussions with the unions with the assistance of the industrial relations services of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I suppose it is my turn now to be attacked by the Minister; he is in good form today.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the State has a role in regard to the company as it still has a substantial shareholding in it.  The State agreed with all the parties involved on the way forward for the privatisation of the company four months ago and it <Col N="76"/>did so in the full knowledge of how matters would proceed.  Part of the agreement reached at that time was that if any changes were to be made, there would be consultation and agreement on them, but clearly that has not happened.</P>
        <P>The unions and workers involved are talking in terms of the normal existing labour relations mechanisms.  They have made four offers at this stage to go down the path of talks with the Labour Relations Commission but management has refused to do that.  Does the Minister consider he has a role in calling on the management to use the normal labour relations mechanisms?  Does he agree there is a responsibility on the State to become involved, as the State has an interest in this company?  However, it is also in the interests of the State that a dispute is avoided by the parties involved using the labour relations mechanisms in place.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to make a statement urging the parties involved to do down that road.  It has been suggested by the unions.  The Government, the Minister and the Taoiseach were involved in the negotiations leading up to the privatisation of the company and, therefore, they have responsibility in this matter given that part of that agreement provided that in the event of proposed changes in work practices and so on, they would be made on the basis of consultation and agreement.  It is clear that the management has not engaged in consultation or sought agreement on them.  It seems to be going ahead with the proposed changes.  It went ahead with the introduction of inferior contracts for new workers and it is now talking of going ahead on 1 March with the introduction of inferior contracts for existing workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I largely agree with much of what the Deputy said.  As he is well aware, the Government, the Taoiseach and I firmly believe in the use of industrial relations machinery and that it should always be used to deal with disputes.  I always believe that consultation and discussion are far preferable to people not talking to each other.  I understand considerable discussion took place between management and unions in the company.  I urge that whatever mechanisms are available within the industrial relations machinery should be used.  </P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the staff and management in Aer Lingus have done a fantastic job compared to other airlines, some of which in terms of international brand names are no longer with us.  They went to the wall because they were not able to compete.  In terms of traditional State owned air carriers, the company has brought Aer Lingus to the top in terms of its achievement, but there is enormous pressure on the company.  Competition is growing daily at Dublin Airport.  There is great expansion on the Middle Eastern routes and many new formidable competitors are competing with Aer Lingus.  As the Deputy will be aware, we signed a new bilateral agreement <Col N="77"/>with Singapore, which will result in more competition on routes to that region.  We are engaged in discussions with China and Thailand.  We hope to see the open skies initiative come to fruition, certainly from an Irish perspective.  Therefore, Aer Lingus must be very lean, fit and competitive.  The best way to achieve that is for all who work in the company to have the focused goal of achieving that end and to not alone maintain the company&rsquo;s position but to see it grow substantially.  There is no doubt there is a huge opportunity for it to do so.  It has been doing that successfully in the European sphere of operations in recent years.  There is a huge opportunity for the company to expand its flights to the Middle East, South Africa, the Far East and potentially to Australia.  Therefore, I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s point in that respect.</P>
        <P>I urge all involved on both sides to use the industrial relations machinery available to them.  Any industrial action would be potentially damaging for the company, its staff, management and everybody involved.  We need to avoid that course of action.  The best way to do that is for both sides to get together with the use of industrial relations machinery available to work with them to achieve a positive outcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any mechanism the Department or the Minister could use to kick-start discussions with the parties involved?  One party appears to be proceeding with its proposals regardless of the views of the other party or its lack of agreement on the proposals.  This dispute affects our national interests.  It will affect our economy and the travelling public.  If a strike can be averted, there is a responsibility to ensure all available mechanisms are used to avert it.  Is there any mechanism the Minister can propose or anything he can do, aside from the public statement he has just made, to urge management to pull back form the brink in regard to this dispute?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe it is ever helpful, and perhaps the Deputy is not suggesting this, to take blame one side or the other.  There are complex issues on both sides that need to be dealt with.  I respect the different views they evoke in terms of dealing with some of the issues.  Both sides have a similar interest, which is the development of Aer Lingus not only on routes to Europe but worldwide, and securing the company as we go forward, making sure it is financially strong, stable, that it has the capacity to enter markets and  to continue to grow by purchase, if necessary, of new aircraft.  It has a good financial fund available to it, a war chest, so to speak, to do that.  That was the purpose of the IPO.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The interests of the management and the workforce in Aer Lingus are the same.  We need to get both sides together to make sure resolution of the issues between them can be quickly facilitated.  All energy should be focused on the competition and how best to meet it as opposed to getting <Col N="78"/>involved in difficult industrial relations scenarios.  I urge both sides to work through this.  I attach no blame to either side in the sense that I understand and respect the points of view of both sides.  They are complex issues, but they are capable of being solved in regard to developing Aer Lingus into the company we all want it to be.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport companies in all transport modes now have freedom to operate in any of the member states of the European Union.  In that context, it is essential that any legislation, such as that referred to by the Deputy, is enacted in an EU-wide framework and is applied equally to all transport undertakings across the EU.</P>
        <P>As stated in my reply to a similar question last September, such legislation was enacted in 2005, on foot of an EU directive, to protect railway staff that provide information to the appropriate authority relevant to an investigation of a railway incident or of any risk to the railway.  Similarly, regulations have recently been drafted, also on foot of an EU directive, to provide for a confidential reporting system in relation to occurrence reporting in civil aviation.  It is expected that this measure will be transposed into Irish law in the near future.  Any similar provisions agreed at European level in respect of other modes of transport will be transposed into Irish Law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will be aware that several years ago Deputy Rabbitte introduced a general whistleblowers Bill.  The Government opposed it on the basis that it had plans to introduce whistleblowers legislation on a Department by Department or sector by sector basis.  In all the years since then little or no progress has been made in introducing whistlebowers legislation or protection for people working in the transport sector. </P>
        <P>I have received representations in recent months from three employees in the aviation sector.  One of them works in airport security, another is an aviation engineer who has concerns about safety and the third is a pilot who also has concerns about safety.  None of those three people who contracted me felt they were in a position to report their concerns to the authorities.  They all feared for their jobs if they did so.  That cannot be good practice in a sector that is as security and safety sensitive as aviation. <Col N="79"/> These are just three examples that have come to my attention in recent months.</P>
        <P>If the Minister was serious about safety and security in the transport sector, he would have taken action by now to provide a framework for people in that kind of situation to report on their concerns.  There should be a reporting system in place which would protect their jobs from implications that might come from their employers.  Does the Minister have any plans at all to introduce legislation at this late stage?  What kind of support can he offer those who are in the front line of aviation and have serious concerns about safety and security?  They feel helpless when trying to take action on those concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Directive EC 2003/42 of 13 June 2003 deals with occurrence reporting in civil aviation.  Occurrence can be regarded as any event which gives rise to a possible safety concern.  The directive includes an option for member states to develop a confidential reporting system.  Drafting of a statutory instrument is at an advanced stage and I expect that the measure will be transposed into Irish law in the near future.  The objective of the regulations is to contribute to the improvement of air safety by ensuring that relevant information on safety is reported, collated, stored, protected and disseminated, so that the lessons learned from the reports can be applied to correct deficiencies and improve the level of air safety generally.</P>
        <P>We should facilitate concerns of members who work in any section of the industry so that they feel protected and confident in themselves and there are no personal repercussions if they raise safety issues.  This directive will help in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister actually doing about it?  He is merely giving us a rundown on the directive.  Article 9 of that directive allows for the establishment of a voluntary reporting system, but he has done nothing about it.  He states that work is under way to transpose that directive.  I received a reply from his Department a few years ago stating that the directive would be transposed.  He was required to transpose it by July 2005, yet that has not happened.  The Minister is a good while in his job.  The directive was supposed to be transposed, so when does he intend to do it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is talking about a number of different things because there are different areas involved.  The Railway Safety Act 2005 provides for the implementation of most provisions in the railway safety directive, including article 16 and article 21, which require the establishment of a national railway safety authority, a railway safety commission and a railway incident investigation unit.  These are all in place, <Col N="80"/>so a number of the different modes under my responsibility are in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there anything about aviation at all?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point.  I expect to transpose into Irish law what I set out regarding civil aviation safety issues a few moments ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is two years late.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 120 and 134 together.</P>
        <P>I am currently implementing a number of policies and measures that will deliver a sustainable transport system, including the provision of supply side infrastructure and demand side management measures, which will reduce congestion and support a modal shift from private to public transport.  This will allow the economy to maintain economic competitiveness by removing infrastructural bottlenecks while increasing social cohesion and reducing environmental impacts.</P>
        <P>Transport 21, which is a &euro;34.3 billion capital investment framework for the period 2006-15, will promote this modal shift from private cars to public transport through the significant rebalancing of investment in favour of public transport.  Overall, &euro;18.5 billion will be invested in the national roads programme, while &euro;15.8 billion will be provided for public transport projects and regional airports.  Funding for a range of sustainable transport initiatives is also provided for under Transport 21, including dissemination of information on eco-driving and travel blending as well as support for alternative fuels and technologies for public transport, haulage and taxi fleets.</P><Col N="81"/>
        <P>The completion of projects identified in Transport 21 will see public transport capacity in the greater Dublin area almost double by 2016.  Modelling of the impacts of Transport 21 in the greater Dublin area shows a reduction of almost 20% in fuel consumption and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions during rush hour in 2016, compared to a situation without Transport 21 in place.  That means I will probably achieve the 20% target ahead of schedule.  This will happen with the complementary implementation of demand side management measures.</P>
        <P>I have also requested my Department to draft a sustainable transport action plan for consultation in 2007.  This will support the Government&rsquo;s revised climate change strategy and energy White Paper, due be published in the coming weeks.  This action plan will set out measures to assist further the progress of the transport sector along a more sustainable path and will make a critical contribution to reducing emissions in line with Ireland&rsquo;s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol in the period 2008-12 and beyond.</P>
        <P>I am also working to achieve emissions reductions in the public transport fleet.  I have requested CIE to move to using a 5% biodiesel blend in current CIE vehicles and to plan for a 30% blend in new vehicles.  My Department is also supporting a pilot project in conjunction with the German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce to promote the use of 100% pure plant oil in heavy goods vehicles and buses.  These measures, together with excise relief and obligatory fuel blending by fuel suppliers in 2009, will contribute to achieving the indicative bio-fuels target of 5.75% of all transport fuels by 2010, as set out in the bio-fuels directive. Technological advances within the automotive industry will be important in bringing more fuel efficient vehicles to the market.</P>
        <P>Tackling transport emissions will remain a key priority and I will continue to promote measures to ensure that the transport sector makes its contribution to reducing national greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>We know that transport continues to be responsible for about one third of Ireland&rsquo;s energy-related CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  Road transport accounts for about 65% of that and it is clear that if the Government is to take the issue of climate change seriously, it must prioritise the whole area of transport.</P>
        <P>We know the situation at present.  We know the level of emissions and the enormous contribution transport makes to greenhouse gas emissions.  It surely makes sense to set out targets for the reduction of those emissions in the transport sector.  It makes even more sense given the policies the Government has been pursuing for the past ten years.  Climate change did not happen overnight.  Inexplicably, the Government has followed a policy in the past ten years of encouraging car <Col N="82"/>dependence among people.  The level of car dependence is far higher than elsewhere and growing each year.  From looking at the budget, we know that there has been a huge overspend on roads compared to investment in public transport.</P>
        <P>The Minister now talks belatedly about rebalancing that investment, but we are coming from a situation where there has been little or no investment in public transport.  The Government&rsquo;s emphasis has been on encouraging greater car ownership, be that through its unsustainable housing policies or through its lack of investment in public transport.  As the Minister responsible for the area that makes the greatest contribution to climate change, what targets has he set for transport in the next five to ten years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a substantial increase in investment in public transport under this Government, as the Deputy rightly mentioned.  One of the challenges the Government faced in its early years in office was dealing with a railway network that, by 1997, needed massive investment to prevent it from having to be decommissioned entirely.  The Government spent more than &euro;1.5 billion to restructure the railway network and try to make it safe.  It is interesting that just &euro;12 million had been invested in the railway network over the previous 20 years, when the Labour Party and Fine Gael had two periods in office.  By contrast, some &euro;777 million is being spent on public transport this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>How many years behind schedule are the Government&rsquo;s plans?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>While I accept that this investment in public transport will not solve all the problems in this regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>One would swear that the Minister was talking about his own money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it is certainly very significant.  The Government intends to achieve the 5.5% bio-fuels target, which has been set under an EU directive, by the target date of 2010.  It is clear that the arrival of more energy-efficient cars on the market is having an effect.  Similarly, better quality roads are helping to reduce emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Government have any targets&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I just mentioned the target.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for energy-related emissions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It has.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>To what level does the Government want to reduce such emissions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are working under the EU directive.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="83"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Energy-related emissions currently comprise 33% of all emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite what Deputy Eamon Ryan said &mdash; he obviously does not have the full facts &mdash; Ireland was the only country to be given an increase on its 1990 base level.  Ireland has been allowed to have growth of 13%, whereas most other countries have had to face reductions.  Deputy Ryan correctly stated that we are above the allowed figure at present, but it was never stated that we would achieve it within a year.  We will achieve the targets set out in the Kyoto Protocol as we move towards 2012.  We have signed up to the future development targets that will apply between 2012 and 2020.  Ireland has the capacity to do that.  I accept that it will involve some pain for various sectors of the economy and for all of us as individuals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have any targets for the transport sector?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have said three times that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s target in relation to transport?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not sign international agreements for fun.  We sign international agreements with the intention of adhering to the targets set out in them.  We will achieve the targets to which we subscribe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about the target for the transport sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I have set out how we will achieve the targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the target?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We will achieve them by investing in public transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister if he has a target.  We know the current level, but we want to know the target level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We will achieve the 5.75% target on the bio-fuels side, which has been set out under an EU directive and has to be achieved by 2010.  The transport figure has grown for many reasons, the most important of which relates to Ireland&rsquo;s thriving economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely it has increased because we are so car-dependent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not.  Despite the increase in the number of cars from 750,000 to 2.2 million, we are actually still under the EU average for car ownership, which is interesting.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="84"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Car ownership is different from car usage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Car usage is as high in many other countries as it is in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Approximately 50% of those who use the Luas system have made a modal shift from cars to public transport.  We can be confident that the development of the two proposed metro lines and the seven proposed Luas lines or extensions will lead to similar modal shifts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There was never any doubt about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a shift from car use.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in doubt.  The problem is capacity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The tragedy of this complex debate, in which I was involved when I served as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, is that it tends to focus on small elements of the system.  As a society we need to maintain our quality of life and the success of the economy while striking an environmental balance on the other side of the equation.  While those two agendas are often in deep conflict, they can complement each other.  We need to find ways of ensuring we achieve the targets to which we have signed up and adhere to our international responsibilities.  We can do that.  I will not pretend that we should do so by destroying our economy, losing jobs and diminishing the quality of life of the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is being disingenuous again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has said we will achieve the targets set out by the EU.  The Taoiseach said this morning that we have signed up to those targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the target to achieve a 20% reduction in our transport emissions on our 1990 levels by 2020?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I said earlier that Ireland is the only country to have been allowed an increase on 1990 levels.  I understand that Spain may have been granted an increase as well, although I am not sure.  I may have been wrong to say that Ireland is the only country in that position &mdash; it may be one of just two such countries.  We have been given permission to increase our emissions by 13% because the base figure comes from 1990, when the Irish economy was in a very poor position.  We have substantially exceeded the 13% <Col N="85"/>growth that we are allowed, but we are beginning to see decreases in the figures in some areas.  We have time to make further reductions so that the targets to which we have signed up can be achieved by 2012, 2020 and beyond.  Ireland has always been good at meeting the obligations in the international treaties to which it has signed up, and it will continue to be in such a position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Although we have already grossly overshot our Kyoto targets, the Minister, in 2007, is continuing to talk about a pilot project.  Does he agree that is a testimony to his commitment to addressing climate change and reducing emissions?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>To what pilot project does the Deputy refer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does he think it is ironic that the pilot project he mentioned is being driven by the German-Irish Chamber of Commerce?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an international pilot project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister tell the House what percentage of the total bus fleet &mdash; the Dublin Bus fleet and the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet &mdash; will be involved in the pilot project?  When will it commence?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this issue.  There is a perception that we can go to the shelf to buy buses with all the modern environmentally friendly facilities needed</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>How many buses will be involved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Such buses are not freely available.  We will pursue the pilot project in conjunction with our European partners.  It is interesting that four prototype buses have been developed by the Wright Group in Northern Ireland.  The first of the buses &mdash; a hybrid bus &mdash; is in use in London.  I am not sure where the others are.  I congratulate the company, which is based on this island, on that achievement.  Dublin Bus has confirmed to me that it will use another of the four buses in Dublin.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has clarified that just one bus is involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about a hybrid bus from Northern Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>He is talking about just one bus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Just four such buses are available in Europe.  The Deputy should not pretend&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is deluded.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="86"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not deluded.  Four hybrid buses, which have been developed by the research and development unit of the Wright Group in Belfast, are available.  I recently met some members of the group&rsquo;s workforce.  One of the buses is being used in London and it is intended that another one of them will be used in Dublin.  That is a statement of fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that help to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s emissions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in the Deputy pretending to the people that loads of hybrid buses are available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>People know they are not available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>They are simply not available.  That is a statement of fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred in his reply to the Government&rsquo;s investment in rail.  We should take freight off the roads and on to the rail network, but the opposite is happening.  Are there are any targets for increasing the amount of freight transported by rail?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no such targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>If not, has the Minister considered offering some money to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to encourage it to carry more freight on the railway network?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have said on many occasions, rail freight works best over long distances when large loads are carried.  We do not have that natural configuration in Ireland because the distances are short.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has tried to maximise its operations in areas of growth.  I have given some examples of how that is being done, for example in container traffic.  A private company, Norfolk Line, worked with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to develop a new route from the west to the south east for port-related activities.  That route was used but it simply did not work.  It is very expensive for the private sector to move goods by truck to a railhead, to have those goods moved by rail, and then to move them by truck again at the other end.  We are trying to maximise the opportunities in this area.  Like every other Deputy, I would like the rail network to be used for more goods and services.  If it is suggested that the Government should ask taxpayers to subsidise highly profitable private sector companies in moving their goods around the country, I can respond by making it clear that we will not do that.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 provides a very large funding commitment for the delivery of an extensive rail-based public transport network in the greater Dublin area in the period up to 2015.  This network is based on the Dublin Transportation Office strategy, A Platform for Change. </P>
        <P>It also includes funding for feasibility studies on those elements of A Platform for Change which are not included in Transport 21 and this includes the proposed Luas line from the city centre to Dundrum via Rathfarnham and Terenure.  In this connection I announced on 30 January last that the RPA is to commence work on the Rathfarnham feasibility study in April.</P>
        <P>It is understood from the RPA that the feasibility study will take a number of months to complete. Pending completion of the study it would be premature to speculate on a feasible construction timetable for the project.  There are a number of other projects in Dublin, including two in particular, with ongoing feasibility studies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The feasibility study is to be welcomed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we in agreement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>We are in agreement.  It was somewhat miraculous that money was allocated <Col N="88"/>for this project even though it was not in the plan.  I wonder how many other projects are in that category.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Deputy it was in the plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It certainly was not in the two-page plan which the Minister published but he might have had a plan in his back pocket called the election plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will show the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Deputy to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

	<P>Deputy Mitchell, without interruption. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>How did it fall off the plan, given the landscape in that area between Dundrum and Tallaght is entirely characterised by rural laneways that have been tarmacadamed over and swallowed up by suburbia which is now very densely populated?  Their transport needs cannot be met by buses even if there were buses available.</P>
        <P>I want to impress on the Minister the urgency of ensuring that this feasibility study is done because it came as a surprise both to the RPA and to the DTO and everybody else on the morning it was announced by the Minister.  Is there a commitment to it?  Given that there was money available for a feasibility study which we did not know about, is it possible that there is money to build it before the end of Transport 21?  We cannot wait if construction is only to start on that project in 2015.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give the Deputy a copy of what I said when I announced Transport 21.  Three feasibility studies and three projects affecting Dublin were announced in Transport 21.  These are the orbital route, the eastern bypass and the Rathfarnham-Terenure Luas project.  That last project was included in the plan on the day I spoke at the announcement in Dublin Castle.  I am glad the Deputy welcomes the project.  She is correct that there is a complex road system in that area  &mdash; which I know very well &mdash; in the context of the delivery of the system and deciding exactly which areas it would go through.  This is the reason the feasibility study is needed.  If this study comes out the right way and approves the project as being a valuable addition to public transport, then we will move to do it.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will know that most of the Luas projects are now being co-funded with substantial investment from the private sector to cover the development costs.  This will also apply if this project meets the feasibility study criteria and meets <Col N="89"/>the financial criteria when it comes to route selection.  I would be very optimistic that this project, if it meets all the criteria, will form part of the roll-out of Transport 21.  It will not be in the first phase of Transport 21 but would come into play more towards the end of the programme.  It will take some time to do all the work on it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  I acknowledge the positive measures proposed in the Bill and I compliment the Minister on the progress being made.  As other speakers have said, progress is required in a number of areas.  More than in any other area I would hope to see a move to getting people out of consistent poverty which has not been progressed in the way we would have hoped, considering the ten years of affluence of the current Government.  I note from today&rsquo;s newspapers that the Minister will launch a ten-year social inclusion plan to eliminate consistent poverty within a decade.  I do not know whether the Minister has already launched the plan or if he will do so later in the day or whether somebody else will launch it on behalf of the Government.  </P>
        <P>The ten-year anti-poverty strategy launched in 1997 aimed to reduce the level of consistent poverty to 2% by 2007 but latest figures show that 7% or almost 300,000 people are ranked as living in consistent poverty this year.  My concern is that we are not progressing quickly enough in this area.  This is not solely a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs but that Department would be a central part of it.  I welcome the plans being announced today which aim by 2016 to reduce by 20% the number of people whose total income is derived from long-term social welfare payments.  It is good to have targets but it is important to achieve them.  I hope the Minister has genuine strategies to achieve these targets.</P>
        <P>Other speakers referred to the elimination of the poverty traps for lone parents and others, particularly those who are on rent allowance.  I welcome the progress being made in this regard.  I ask the Minister to clarify when the changes proposed in the Bill with regard to a disallowance for a certain amount of earnings and money from community employment schemes when awarding rent allowance will be implemented.  RAS is not <Col N="91"/>fully up and running in several local authority areas and many people in private rented accommodation are not even aware of the existence of this scheme.  Is this linked to those in RAS or does it apply to people who are on rent allowance but who for one reason or another are not yet in RAS or perhaps do not qualify or their landlord is not willing to become involved?</P>
        <P>I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Curran and others regarding the limits for rent allowance.  It is a reality that for people in certain places &mdash; mostly in cities but my colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin stated that it also applies in her part of the country &mdash; the limits mean that sometimes people are unable to get accommodation.  As Deputy Curran said, it is not desirable but it is the case that people hand over money to the landlord outside of the official rent and this puts them in danger of not having enough money for other bills.  I support calls to have the proposal reconsidered.</P>
        <P>Deputy Boyle and other Members raised the matter of adult dependants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the concept of dependency, Members on all sides of the House have at various times expressed the strong view that in a modern, civilised world adults should not be treated as the dependants of others.  We need to move towards a system under which a person automatically receives a separate payment rather than having to ask for it.  No adult should have to be treated as a dependant.  In that context, there is much unfairness in the system, in the balance between the tax and social welfare codes and in the different ways in which people are treated.</P>
        <P>An e-mail I received yesterday reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">I was shocked to recently discover a blatant unfairness in the system and I wondered what is being done to address this.  I learned that if you are living with a person as &ldquo;married&rdquo; as far as the social welfare services are concerned, you are means-tested as a married couple.  This is particularly tough for a couple where one is on disability and due to the working person&rsquo;s income is then told they will no longer qualify because of some mysterious magic that occurs where you are assessed as having half the working person&rsquo;s income as means.  It does not allow for the fact that the working partner, while happy to share his or her life, is not necessarily interested in supporting a dependent who cannot work.  They will also lose the medical card, from what I understand.  So a person who may be on a good wage for a single suddenly has a massive burden to bear.  To not live together reduces the ill person&rsquo;s chance of living in a situation where they can be assisted, and not living with strangers to struggle alone.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">So let us say the Department have a right to force these presumptions upon people, which they clearly don&rsquo;t.  If a couple want to be married, they will get married.  They should be <Col N="92"/>allowed to decide their status.  But the real discrimination kicks in when the exact definition of the couple according to one arm of the State doesn&rsquo;t apply to the other arm.  So the man or woman who now suddenly supports a person who cannot work or financially contribute to the household in any way, and also has added medical expenses, is now told that, equally magically, they are not married when they step into Revenue buildings.  The working person who took on the financial burden of the one on disability is now not allowed claim a cent in relation to this State-imposed predicament.  This is totally unfair.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I cannot believe that there isn&rsquo;t an urgent reaction to put this right.  You cannot have two parallel universes in Government where people are messed around like this.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister can understand that this person feels very strongly on the issue, rightly so.  Why should a person be treated in one way by the tax code and in another by the social welfare code, when in each case the person is disadvantaged in those circumstances?  This issue needs to be seriously addressed.</P>
        <P>As my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on education, I wish to address some of the issues in the Minister&rsquo;s brief which relate to education, particularly school meals.  I note that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul&rsquo;s in its pre-budget submission suggested there should be one body with overall responsibility in this area.  The issue falls between a number of stools, including social welfare, health, education and community affairs, given that many of the school meal schemes are operated by community organisations.  There is a strong argument that we need to co-ordinate the school meals service.  In the context of child poverty, if children are missing out or falling between the cracks, they often go to school hungry and cannot do justice to their educational opportunities.  I accept much progress has been made with school meals and a huge effort has been made by a variety of organisations.  There is probably a school meals scheme in most disadvantaged areas.  However, there are children who do not have the opportunity to avail of a school meals system.  I support the proposal that it be co-ordinated in some way to ensure we will not have anybody falling through the gaps.</P>
        <P>The other recommendation the Society of St. Vincent de Paul made was that there should be adequate capital provision to ensure school facilities would be available to allow food to be offered to pupils in appropriate ways.  Again, strictly speaking, this is not the responsibility of the Minister, but his Department, or the Department of Education and Science, might take the initiative in ensuring we have a comprehensive school meals system in order that children will not go to school hungry.</P>
        <P>Also with regard to education, I welcome the increase in the back to school clothing and foot<Col N="93"/>wear allowance.  Unfortunately, the increase falls short of the cost to families, particularly when children are making the transition to post-primary school, when there are many extra costs to be met.  I urge a continuation of progress in this area.</P>
        <P>As with other Deputies, there are many other issues I could have raised.  I hope the Minister will respond to the points I have made.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister on his budget and the fair way in which he distributed the finances across the board for social welfare recipients.  I have little doubt that the progress he has made in the couple of years since he took office as Minister for Social and Family Affairs will increase greatly in his next five years in office.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the implementation of certain social improvements announced in budget 2007.  These include increases in child benefit, the one-parent family payment income limit and the respite care grant.  It also provides for enhancements to illness benefit, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and supplementary welfare allowance schemes.  It further provides for the introduction of a special rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance which will, in specified circumstances, be payable simultaneously with certain other social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is and has been a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended, and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to carer&rsquo;s allowance to ensure limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.  This means test has been eased significantly during the years, most notably with the introduction of the spouse&rsquo;s earnings disregard.  Following budget 2006, since April of that year the earnings disregard for a couple has been set at &euro;580 per week which is equivalent to gross average industrial earnings.  As a result of further improvements which the Minister announced in budget 2007, this disregard will increase to &euro;640 per week for a couple from April.  When this increase is in place, a couple with two children will be able to earn up to &euro;36,240 and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure surpasses the commitment in Towards 2016 to ensure those on average industrial earnings can continue to qualify for a <Col N="94"/>full carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Complete abolition of the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance would cost in the region of over &euro;140 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>From June 2005 the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers providing full-time care for a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance and benefit, are entitled to this payment, subject to meeting the full-time care condition.  In budget 2007 the level of the grant was increased by &euro;300 to &euro;1,500 from June.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support.  As a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual.  Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.  We are all aware that this has been a cause of particular concern to people in receipt of a social welfare payment when they become carers.  For that reason, I was delighted the Minister undertook to introduce fundamental structural reforms in this area in budget 2007.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>From September 2007, people in receipt of another social welfare payment who also provide full-time care and attention to a person will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive a carer&rsquo;s payment depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent to a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  It is estimated that approximately 18,000 carers will benefit from this measure at a cost of &euro;56.72 million in a full year.  The precise details as to how the new arrangements will operate are being examined and will be set out in legislation shortly.</P>
        <P>The improvements for carers which were announced in budget 2007 will cost over &euro;107 million for a full year.  As a result of the improvements expenditure on weekly payments to carers will be in the region of &euro;357 million in 2007.  A further &euro;64.5 million will be provided to carers in the form of respite care grants.  In addition, as a consequence of the new arrangements with regard to receipt of another welfare payment while caring, 18,000 carers will also benefit from expenditure on other non-caring schemes to the tune of approximately &euro;57 million in a full year and nearly &euro;14 million in 2007.</P>
        <P>We are committed to working for and with carers to deliver increased benefits, supports and services for them and their families.  The improvements for carers which were announced in budget 2007 and being enacted through this Bill are further evidence of this commitment.</P>
        <P>There has been substantial progress made in reducing child poverty.  A range of measures across a number of Departments and agencies over recent years has resulted in more than 250,000 people being lifted out of consistent poverty, including an estimated 100,000 children.  However, an unacceptable number of children remain in consistent poverty and we must remain <Col N="95"/>focused on a further substantial reduction of child poverty.  The level of commitment in this area was prominent in budget 2007, in which a range of targeted measures and supports specifically to benefit children in low income families and families on welfare was announced at a cost of over &euro;240 million.  The significantly improved and targeted measures announced in the budget represent a substantial move in that direction.  This is the reason the decision was taken to deliberately focus the increased child supports in the areas where we know child poverty exists.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The measures in budget 2007 include, for the first time in over a decade, reform of the qualified child allowance, QCA, formerly child dependant allowance, which is seen as an important welfare weapon in tackling child poverty levels.  The three existing rates of QCA have been combined into a new single high rate of &euro;22 per week that will benefit over 340,000 children of families on welfare.</P>
        <P>The rate of child benefit has been increased by &euro;10, bringing new rates to &euro;160 and &euro;195 per month.  The child benefit increases will apply to all children, benefiting over 560,000 families in respect of approximately 1.1 million children.  The monthly rate for the first and second child in 1997 was &euro;38.  In 2007 it will be more than four times higher.  If we include the new early child care supplement, when measures in budget 2007 take effect, a family with three children under six will receive direct financial support of &euro;9,180 per annum.  This is an increase of approximately &euro;7,670 since 1997.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCallananFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to get the opportunity to say a few words on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007.  I compliment the Minister on the excellent work he is doing as Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  I am proud to be a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs at which we have many constructive meetings with the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Minister has made great changes in the system in order to get people out of the poverty trap.  He has allowed people earn more in the workplace without losing social welfare entitlements.  Lone parents can now earn up to &euro;400 per week before losing the full entitlement.  Widows and State pensioners over the age of 66 can also have some earnings.  Many of these people are able and willing to continue some part-time employment.  They can now earn up to &euro;200 per week and still get their full pension.  This is welcome.</P>
        <P>The provision with regard to non-contributory pensions is also welcome.  Previously, a young widow lucky enough to get a contributory widow&rsquo;s pension could earn as much as she liked and still get her pension.  However, a widow on a non-contributory means tested pension lost out.  For every &euro;1 she earned, she lost &euro;1 of her pen<Col N="96"/>sion which left her in a poverty trap.  The Minister has changed this and these widows can now earn up to &euro;200 without affecting their pension.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to increase the qualified adult allowance by &euro;22.70 in the budget.  I welcome too the fact that an adult dependant can now get an allowance on her own behalf.  The increase in children&rsquo;s allowance is also welcome as many families depend on it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the increase in unemployment benefit and in the farm assist payment.  As a farmer, I welcome the rural social scheme under the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, which is linked to the farm assist scheme.  The rural social scheme does vital work in the country, for example, village enhancement or work with the elderly.  In the future, we hope it will operate a nitelink bus service in rural areas.  The increase in payments resulting from these schemes is welcome.  The schemes encourage people to do work that needs to be done and help create opportunities for people to get back into employment.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on his commitment to carers as this is an area to which I too am committed.  Support for carers has always been a priority for Fianna F&aacute;il.  Our policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and of enabling people to remain in their homes for as long as possible.  This is being achieved through our proposals.  Benefits and supports for carers will continue to be expanded and increased.  Carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and respite grants were introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il in Government.  Since 1997, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for payment have been eased, coverage of schemes has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite grant have been introduced.  Numbers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance are up from 1,600 in 2000 to 27,000 today.</P>
        <P>The budget introduced for the first time an entitlement for carers to retain a full social welfare payment and receive in addition up to half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  This will boost the income of an estimated 18,000 carers by &euro;109 per week.  This is particularly welcome as the Oireachtas committee had been campaigning for this for some time.  The Minister listened to us and said he would bring the proposal to Government and he has done that.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the new dual payment system demonstrates we now recognise that the carer&rsquo;s allowance is less of a welfare payment and more of a direct support for carer&rsquo;s duties.  This gives recognition to carers, especially widows.  The situation had been very unfair.  Some carers with reasonable income were getting the allowance but some widows were not entitled to the allowance because they were on a widow&rsquo;s pension.  It is estimated that some 14,000 currently in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance are also entitled to another welfare payment.  A further 4,000 people <Col N="97"/>in receipt of other welfare payments are also carers.</P>
        <P>Annual respite grants have increased by &euro;300 to &euro;1,500.  This will benefit almost 40,000 carers.  The increase represents an increase of 490% in the level of grants since the introduction of the grant in 1999.  Increases of &euro;18 and &euro;20 in the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit will directly benefit 28,500 carers.  Means tests for carer&rsquo;s allowance will increase the income disregard by &euro;30 to &euro;320 for a single person and by &euro;60 to &euro;640 for a couple.  This means a couple with two children can earn up to &euro;36,240 and still receive the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as be entitled to free travel and household benefits.  In addition, easing the means test will allow an additional 1,200 carers to qualify for payment and 2,500 existing carers will receive an increase in weekly payments.  The earnings threshold for carer&rsquo;s benefit increased &euro;30 to &euro;330 per week.</P>
        <P>A few years ago when this carer&rsquo;s allowance was introduced we had people coming to our clinics inquiring about it.  If they had any earnings, we had to send them home disappointed &mdash; if we were being honest with them &mdash; because they would not get it but now a married couple earning a reasonable income of &euro;640 per week can qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  We are delighted that most people who come to us now can qualify and we hope the threshold will increase in time.</P>
        <P>There have been many calls for the scrapping of the means test.  In line with other social welfare schemes, a means test is applied to carer&rsquo;s allowance to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.  The means test has been eased significantly over the years, most notably with the introduction of the spouse&rsquo;s earning disregard.  Following budget 2006, since April last the earnings disregard for a couple has been set at &euro;580, which is equivalent to gross average industrial earnings.  As a result of the further improvements announced in budget 2007, the disregard will be increased to &euro;640 per week for a couple from April 2007.  With these increases in place, a couple with two children will be able to earn almost &euro;37,000 and still quality for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance, as well as the free travel and household benefits.  This measure surpasses the commitment in Towards 2016 to ensure that all those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>Complete abolition of the means test would cost an estimated &euro;140 million in a full year.  The Government has an open mind on this issue, but it is debatable whether such a proposal could be considered to be the best use of resources.  The view of some support organisations is that such money, were it available, would be more beneficial to carers if it were invested in community care services supporting them in their caring role such as additional respite care facilities, home helps and public health nurses.</P><Col N="98"/>
        <P>In 2005 the respite care grant was also extended to all carers who are providing full-time care to a person in such need subject to employment related conditions.  In this regard, there is a need for us to look at the case of farmers where this seems to pose a slight problem.  A person who is minding an elderly person and also looking after the farm can be ruled out for the carer&rsquo;s allowance if he or she is not careful because the scheme provides that one may work outside the home for only 15 hours per week.  As everybody knows, farming is an unusual occupation in that it could involve 15 hours one week and 20 hours the next.  I ask the Minister to allow flexibility in this regard because it is causing a problem in some areas.  When we ask the Minister, Deputy Brennan, to do something he always looks at it and finds a way around the criteria to ensure people get their entitlements.</P>
        <P>Another improvement to the respite grant is that a carer who is providing care for more than two persons will receive a grant in respect of each person for whom she or he is caring.  Previously, a maximum of two grants was paid.</P>
        <P>The new social partnership agreement Towards 2016 sets out as a priority the drawing up of a comprehensive national carers strategy that would fully address the provisions of service support entitlements for carers.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has extended the care leave scheme, which allows for the protection of carers&rsquo; employment, to two years.  Also care sharing situations can now be accommodated on the carer&rsquo;s allowance support scheme.  This allows two carers who are providing full-time care in an established pattern, for example, every second week, to share carer&rsquo;s allowance income and the annual respite grant.  Both carers will also receive the household benefit package of free schemes.  We have also moved to accommodate carers providing care on, for example, alternative weeks where a care recipient attends a residential institution on the other week.  The increased flexibility in the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme allows carers to combine the valuable provision of care to a person who requires full-time care and attention and to also participate in work if they so wish.  In September 2006 the Minister launched a major nationwide awareness campaign to promote an increase in take-up of the welfare supports and entitlements available to carers.  From June 2006 the number of hours a carer may work and still receive a carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit has been increased from ten to 15.  I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister, a Galwayman doing a good job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The improvements in the rates of social welfare are beyond dispute, but we should not lose the run of ourselves in estimating the sums available for people living on social welfare.  When one counterbalances items like the increases in the cost of heat, light and foodstuffs, <Col N="99"/>the social welfare increases will be quickly absorbed.  The social partnership process identified inflation as the key issue and inflation could rapidly eat into the welcome increases in social welfare.  We should acknowledge that there is still a great deal to be done in this area.</P>
        <P>On the carer&rsquo;s allowance, I am dealing with a particular individual who was transferred from one benefit to another.  I understood that a person would not be transferred to his or her detriment, but this individual has lost the fuel allowance and it makes quite a sizeable difference.  If I give the Minister the details of that case, he might look at it.  I have received replies to parliamentary questions on the matter, which affects a small group of people.  I will pass on the details to the Minister because it is making a big difference to the individual to whom I refer.  Even though the increases are welcome, such a predicament can have a major impact on a person&rsquo;s income and quality of life.</P>
        <P>I welcome section 24 which is one of the most meaningful measures in the Bill.  Almost daily I meet people on rent supplement who would really like to work but who for many years has been precluded from working because it would lead to losing rent support.  The rental allowance scheme is slowly taking effect, but this measure will ease the way a little further for some.</P>
        <P>It is also a socially progressive measure because many who might well have formed a family have been prevented from doing so because this would result in a major difference in income.  We need to get to the point where people can form families where such exist.  Many have not declared their position because it would place them in a poverty trap.  The change to which I refer is meaningful and will make a big difference.  Although I am not aware of the level of interest in the rent allowance scheme by landlords, it is certainly being pushed heavily by local authorities.</P>
        <P>I was disappointed this year there was not further movement on the payment of &euro;1,000 per child.  Some of the child care providers increased the price of child care provision when that payment was introduced and it is disappointing the payment has not been kept in line with the cost of living.  There is no doubt that there is an attempt to ensure the availability of an adequate number of places, but the cost of child care is still very substantial.  We must get to grips with why it is so expensive.  Commercial rates and VAT, for example, contribute to the cost.  In this regard, one should bear in mind that child care providers do not earn a huge amount of money.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister considered the new payment being made to those in residential care?  Responsibility may well be transferred between one Department and the other.  Under the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, people in nursing homes could be charged a certain sum every week.  I do not know if it was intended to charge people with mental or physical disabilities in residential care <Col N="100"/>when the legislation was first drafted.  Those in receipt of a social welfare payment are now to have a significant proportion of the payment deducted.  The method of extracting the money is mean and I do not believe it was the intention of the legislation.  The Government may be legally right but I do not know if it is morally right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill which gives effect to the changes announced in the Budget Statement last year.  In spite of some of my previous contributions on Social Welfare Bills in recent years, I must concede that the latest social welfare package is one of the more welcome aspects of this year&rsquo;s budget.  Normally social welfare changes are calculated to ease the pain and make life a little more bearable for the socially deprived.  One must consider how the changes measure up in bridging the gap between the most disadvantaged and most privileged.  Straightaway the gap has been widened by the 1% reduction in the higher rate of income tax which for the most part benefits the better-off.</P>
        <P>The non-contributory old age pension payment has hit the &euro;200 barrier for the first time.  This raised a chorus of war whoops from the Government benches when the budget was announced but it is still &euro;3.50 below the poverty line.  We should look after the elderly but sometimes neglect to do so.  At times we lead ourselves to believe we were the creators of the Celtic tiger; rather, the elderly were its creators and we who are merely benefactors should not leave them behind at this stage.</P>
        <P>The contributory old age pension of &euro;209.30 is just short of &euro;6 above the poverty level.  This clearly shows we have a long way to go before we eradicate poverty.  One yardstick by which to measure the ongoing and cumulative effects of successive budgets on the lives of the poor is the figures quoted by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The number of calls to the society has quadrupled in recent years and it spends &euro;750,000 each week addressing poverty.  This is a substantial sum to be required by the less well-off.  The annual spend of over &euro;39 million somewhat dampens the Celtic tiger&rsquo;s roar.  Many of those who found it necessary to contact the society for help were in poorly paid jobs, but in employment nevertheless.  Their levels of income, although low, rendered them ineligible to qualify for social welfare benefits.</P>
        <P>Pensioners have always been playing catch-up, particularly in the past three years.  The budgets for these years were coming from a very low base.  It is somewhat disturbing to note that the Irish old age pension is at the bottom of the EU league and that Ireland is fifth from bottom on the list of OECD countries.  To increase the old age pension to a level acceptable to the European Union and remove pensioners from the poverty trap, one would need to increase the rate by at least &euro;50 per week.  Promises were made that it would <Col N="101"/>be increased by &euro;100 per week but we will wait and see.</P>
        <P>The increases in pension rates will come under pressure from increases in the price of food, gas, electricity and medicines, as mentioned by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  It is expensive for pensioners merely to stay warm and alive.  Affordable heating systems are the one factor pensioners worry about and it presents a major difficulty for them.</P>
        <P>We are told the country has been awash with cash in the past two or three years.  It is mystifying, therefore, to consider why pensions and other State payments have not been adjusted to a more realistic level before now.  Noises are being made in this regard because a general election is due.  The pension rate will move towards the &euro;300 barrier which pensioners well deserve.</P>
        <P>Lone parents comprise a key group likely to be caught in the poverty trap.  The child dependant allowance targeted at children in poverty has not increased in 12 years.</P>
        <P>Overall, the social welfare package is to be given a guarded welcome but to state it tackles poverty is somewhat more than wide of the mark.  A couple of years ago the ESRI stated an 11% rise in income tax would be required to make any dent in relative income poverty.  Although we have a high level of employment and average income has risen dramatically in recent years, the number whose income is below 50% of average income is still well above the EU average.  The ESRI stated a successful anti-poverty policy would require an improved education system, further employment opportunities and better income supports.  Budget 2007 could have adopted a greater and more targeted approach to those in need of help, particularly families on social welfare and the lower paid.</P>
        <P>Childhood food poverty needs to be tackled, with a particular focus on inequality.  Dietary habits and poverty are intrinsically linked.  We know families on low incomes consume less fresh fruit and vegetables than those on higher incomes.  The former tend to consume more foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar, thereby putting themselves at risk of having a poor diet.  Children are the most vulnerable in this regard and always seem to suffer.  Parents are not to blame since diets are strongly influenced by social and environmental circumstances.  Low income is a major factor in this mix.  Parents play a key role in determining their children&rsquo;s diet and it is important that they be supported through social welfare initiatives that increase the availability of healthy and affordable food and improve access thereto.</P>
        <P>There is growing awareness of food poverty as a structural constraint on food consumption and dietary intake, particularly among low income groups.  Food poverty has multifaceted consequences for health, education and social participation and there is considerable scope for Government support to overcome it.</P><Col N="102"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to end homelessness by 2010 sounds a little like a pipedream.  It is somewhat reminiscent of the old boast by the former Soviet Union that it abolished poverty, even though people were begging for food outside the Orthodox churches.  The &euro;20 increase in social welfare rates is to be welcomed but it provides cold comfort for those on the streets without a roof over their heads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly agree with the sentiments of the two previous speakers.  They have pointed to several of the difficulties highlighted by the Bill.  While the Green Party welcomes many of the measures included in it, I cannot help but believe there is a certain begrudging attitude on the part of the Government towards the less well-off.  Given that 80% of the population are doing very well, there is surely an onus on us to reach out a little more to those who are not benefiting from the largesse of the Celtic tiger and who need a hand up into a world in which they will have afforded to them the opportunities enjoyed for many years by everyone else who has benefited from the Celtic tiger.  The Bill could have done more for the less well-off.</P>
        <P>Maternity and paternity benefits for parents of young children could be extended further.  It is important that we afford parents as many choices as possible in their children&rsquo;s early years.  It is crucial to get it right in those early years but I am not convinced the Minister is going as far as in many other European countries.  He could certainly go further in the matter of paternity benefits for fathers who want to spend time with their young children during the crucial formative years and he could increase the period of leave because, at a time when the economy is doing well, it is important that we give parents the choice of returning to work or remaining at home.</P>
        <P>I welcome the &euro;10 increase in child benefit as a step in the right direction, although my party proposes we should go further.  Parents are paying up to &euro;1,000 per month for child care, which places a significant financial burden on those who return to work.  The Minister and his Government colleagues should go further in providing community-based child care services.  In Denmark and Germany beautiful kindergarten and child care facilities are provided in local parks or beside green areas but that is not the case in Ireland.  This morning I visited a gaelscoil where the students have been housed in prefabs for the past ten years.  There is an onus on the Minister to provide more for children in their early years rather than reducing them to sitting in prefabs or making their parents pay exorbitant fees for child care.</P>
        <P>I have yet to be convinced that the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to move community welfare officers from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Social and Family Affairs will not create a conflict of interest.  It is crucial that <Col N="103"/>community welfare officers consider first and foremost the health needs of claimants rather than the financial aspects of cases.  I am concerned about the transfer of staff between Departments and urge the Minister to reconsider the issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister should also reconsider the antiquated and anachronistic language that runs through the Bill.  The phrase &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo; is Victorian in origin.  I hope the Minister will devise a more appropriate and modern term which would better describe the difficulties encountered by parents.  Other Ministers have proposed new wording when making changes to primary legislation.</P>
        <P>I suggest a clear code of conduct be put in place for means-testing because it can be very invasive for claimants to have someone sit at their kitchen table to determine their sources of income.  Improvements have been made in recent years but it is important that individual claimants are made aware of their rights.  The means-testing interview can be heartbreaking.  Therefore, it would be of some benefit if there was more clarity in the questions which may be asked.</P>
        <P>I welcome some of the changes made regarding disclosure of information.  While we must be careful when we allow information to be shared between Departments, it makes sense to allow for greater sharing with the Department of Finance.  This is particularly the case in respect of the building industry which, by its nature, involves a very abrupt process and requires better checks and balances.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to the needs of cohabiting couples.  The parents of more than one third of the children born in Ireland today are unwed.  We have to ensure social welfare codes catch up with the reality of modern Irish life.  It is time social welfare provisions reflected the many variants of the nuclear family.</P>

	<P>I welcome the broad sweep of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007.  A phenomenal amount of money is being directed towards those who most need it such as people without jobs or on low incomes and those who helped to create the Celtic tiger and now deserve a return on their investment.</P>
        <P>During a previous debate on social welfare legislation I noted that the Minister had changed the rules on the back to education allowance in order to allow flexibility when people were made redundant.  At the time people I knew were preparing to return to education the following September and I asked whether the provision would apply to them.  On behalf of this small but <Col N="104"/>appreciative group, I thank the Minister for ensuring they would be able to benefit because it would have been unfair if they had missed out just because the budget had been introduced after the start of the college term.</P>
        <P>On cross-Border co-operation, I welcome the changes to the free travel scheme which will take effect from 2 April.  I must declare my interest in the matter, as I already have an application form to give to my mother.  With two relations living in the Six Counties, I am sure she will want to avail of the opportunity to travel there.  I often avail of the Enterprise train service and hear people tell each other about the imminent introduction of free travel.  That people can travel throughout the island without having to worry about cost is one of best aspects of all-Ireland co-operation, particularly given that many of those concerned have leisure time or are trying to escape their grandchildren in order to enjoy some peace.  The Minister will be remembered for opening the Border to the elderly.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about the challenges faced by people who in the past had to find employment in Northern Ireland, or the Six Counties as we know it, after losing their job in County Donegal.  For the people concerned, it is not a matter of referring to Northern Ireland or the Six Counties because when they lose their job, they go to Derry.  I am aware of a number of people who paid stamps in the Republic but had to move owing to factors beyond their control.  If they get sick, they will not be able to prove residency in the Six Counties, yet they will be means-tested if they apply for support in their home region.</P>
        <P>The issue concerns EU Regulation Nos. 1408/71 and 574/72, which constitute binding rules whereby a person cannot elect to be attached to a member state&rsquo;s social security scheme to claim benefit from a state of his or her choice and pertain to the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons.  However, I make my point in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, all-island economies, the increasing importance of all-Ireland education and the north-west region.  The scenario whereby people pay stamps in this jurisdiction for 25 years, work in the other jurisdiction for another two or three years and then fall ill but are unable to draw down any supports would constitute a barrier to cross-Border working.  As I have just commended breaking down such cross-Border barriers, I ask the Minister to consider this issue.</P>
        <P>In respect of the diet supplement scheme, I ask the Minister to forward to me a guideline that outlines the changes.  I have in mind the example of a pensioner who was told that she was eligible to receive &euro;6.30 before she became a pensioner.  However, on reaching pensionable age, her entitlement fell to &euro;1.30.  She is unable to understand why her need for a diet supplement decreased as she became older.  Usually people become more needy as they age.  This may have <Col N="105"/>been a one-off problem and I will forward the details of the case to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Regarding the transfer of the community welfare service, I accept the Minister&rsquo;s comments.  I note the Minister mentioned that he has carried out much consultation in this respect and that he desires the maintenance of a responsible and flexible service.  Community welfare officers, CWOs, play a particular role and have a wide geographic spread.  They operate in places where no one else goes and provide a service that probably exceeds that which is specified in their rule book.  Elderly people can bare their souls to them.</P>
        <P>While this is hard to explain without getting the CWOs into trouble, they have been flexible, responsive and more, as well as being highly knowledgeable about the people with whom they deal.  As they work in very small communities they know the people and can discern when someone tells them a long story.  Similarly, they can recognise genuine cases.  The transfer between Departments should not bring about a more centralised focus to this facility because this would remove visiting professionals from a region and would minimise the potential for flexibility and responsiveness.  While I accept the Minister&rsquo;s comments, I enter the caveat that I would be concerned were any of the existing flexibility to be removed.</P>
        <P>I chair the Joint Committee on Art, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which held a meeting with the Arts Council today.  While I may be stealing Deputy Michael Higgins&rsquo;s thunder, artists can have very low regular incomes.  Moreover, they constitute another group whose entitlement to a pension will be extremely hard to define in many cases.  The Minister&rsquo;s officials, with the Arts Council, could consider the concept of a pension for artists.  One might ask why artists should be treated as a special case.  They are special in that they contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s culture and without them, Ireland would not be as attractive to tourists and would not enjoy such worldwide renown.  While this may be a quirky request, it is as relevant as any other.</P>
        <P>I have been informed that although the increases in the old age pension are welcome, the difference between non-contributory and contributory pensions is becoming increasingly narrow.  Moreover, I understand the unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance rates are the same at present.  In this context, I suggest that some people might consider they should enjoy greater entitlements having worked all their lives.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister in respect of his work in respect of carers, as significant moves have been made.  The increase of &euro;300 in the respite care allowance is extremely important.  This is one of the best schemes available and its means test should be reduced continually until the point at which it can be removed is reached.  I believe that means are irrelevant to people who are sufficiently big-spirited to look after someone <Col N="106"/>they love in their home.  Perhaps extremely wealthy people who were in a position to be able to do whatever they wish without worrying about finances would put a person into a home, whereas other people might chug along and keep the person in their homes.  People should stay at home for as long as possible.  It has been proven that people live longer and happier lives when remaining as close to home as possible.</P>
        <P>Carers may now work for up to 15 hours a week.  Why was the limit not raised to 20 hours?  Giving a couple of hours each day to someone would be a positive move.  The Minister should continue his important work in respect of the carer&rsquo;s allowance, which is progressing well.</P>
        <P>People who are over 80 continually ask me why they have not been removed from the tax code.  While I presume there are plenty of simple answers, I mention it as a query I receive regularly.</P>
        <P>I accept the cost of fuel is rising and I trust the Minister will continue to keep that in mind.  While I accept he has done much regarding the provision of additional electricity units, one must continue to focus on this issue.</P>
        <P>Although I would like to raise many other issues, I am short of time.  Essentially, I commend the Minister on the work that is under way.  He spoke of paying child benefit into either the bank or the post office and I was glad to note he still included the latter, as I wish to keep rural post offices alive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  I could raise many issues pertaining to social welfare.  I compliment the Minister and the Government on their excellent work and the amount of good news, in terms of increases and additional money, that has been made available through the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill and the budget.  Many long-standing issues have either been addressed or begun to be addressed in this Bill and some other Bills in recent years.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss carers and carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The introduction of the carer&rsquo;s allowance some years ago has been of great benefit because it has recognised carers.  Indeed, this year&rsquo;s increases have provided more recognition to carers.  A number of developments have taken place in recent years.  For example, weekly payments have increased greatly and qualifying conditions have been significantly eased.  The aim in respect of the carer&rsquo;s allowance to get as close as possible to disregarding means tests completely, as this is one of the extant issues.  An invaluable service is provided to the State and to the recipient by those who provide care in their own homes for their elderly relatives or family members who require 24-hour care.  The nation should never be ashamed to give them credit for the amount of work they do.</P><Col N="107"/>
        <P>A number of improvements have taken place in recent years.  The introduction of carer&rsquo;s benefit was another great initiative, as was the recent introduction of the respite care grant.  In addition, the increases in the respite care grant, from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,200 and to &euro;1,500 this year by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, are welcome.  It gives those who provide full-time care a once-off opportunity to deal with necessary issues and is highly significant.</P>
        <P>The carer&rsquo;s allowance has been a significant issue for some time.  Some other related issues should also be addressed.  I refer to better provision for people with intellectual or mental disabilities by means of a non-means tested payment.  I know it is a small matter.  They are on disability benefit but should be on invalidity benefit on a permanent basis.  I come across this from time to time and the Minister should examine it.</P>
        <P>The increases made during the past number of years in pensions were widely welcomed.  People on non-contributory pensions can have insurable employment and still claim the full non-contributory pension or the State pension, which is welcome.  A number of people on the pro-rata self-employment pension do not receive the full pension.  Their numbers dwindle year by year.  The possibility of people with eight or nine of the ten parts paid receiving the full pension should be considered.</P>
        <P>Many elderly missionaries are returning from foreign lands after being domiciled in other countries for many years.  They must wait a number of years before they can receive the State pension.  I understand why the Department introduced the regulations.  However, this should be examined and regulations should be introduced to address the situation.  Many of them would return home if they could receive the State pension rather than living off their house or order which they would not like to do.</P>
        <P>Every public representative meets people who, for 101 different reasons, do not pay PRSI.  Through my information leaflets I encourage people to check their records and ensure when they reach the age of State pension that PRSI has been paid.  People who joined the early farm retirement scheme in the mid-1990s and who had been paying tax and PRSI on their farms were advised they no longer needed to pay PRSI.  They are in their mid-60s when they come off the farm retirement scheme after ten years and realise their mistake.  As no PRSI was paid during that time they are not entitled to a State pension.</P>
        <P>A number of people are affected by this and it behoves all of us as public representatives to make these points on pensions, PRSI and social welfare at public meetings.  People who earned less than &pound;2,500 did not have to pay PRSI.  When one does not have to do so one will not.  One person was deprived of a State pension because <Col N="108"/>of an income of &pound;2,497.  The lack of knowledge about the benefits of PRSI should be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill also addresses the issue of community welfare officers.  They do a huge amount of work to provide a service throughout the country.  The Minister will move them from one Department to another and consultation and discussion on this has gone on for quite some time.  They are the State&rsquo;s arm for people in huge difficulty for one reason or another.  They are at the coalface and continually deal with issues.  They should be complimented for the work they do and supported in every way, shape and form by the State.</P>
        <P>It is easy to be critical and it is always stated that people live off the State and receive money for nothing.  Across the spectrum, people who depend on social welfare are at the lowest ebb.  The increases provided by this Government ease the pain and difficulties they have.  Through no fault of their own, people have major difficulties such as family circumstances or illness.  As public representatives we meet these people regularly as do community welfare officers.  They must be dealt with and it behoves us as a State to look after the less well-off.</P>
        <P>We looked after State pensions for the elderly well during the past few years.  The elderly survived here during more difficult times and ensured the Celtic tiger was dreamed of and fuelled.  It is important we look after them.  This will be a major issue.  It is great to see people living out the latter years of their lives in the comfort they deserve.  For far too long concern has been raised about pensions.  An issue exists with regard to the State and the provision of private pensions, which is continually discussed by the Government and proposals are put forward.  The Minister is also greatly concerned about this.</P>
        <P>The farm assist scheme, which was first mooted in 1998 and 1999, is a great scheme.  Its follow-on, the rural social scheme, has done great work for the less well-off.  The main issues with which I am concerned are those schemes, the pro-rata pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit.  I implore the Minister to consider the entitlement of missionaries who are abroad and wish to return home to the State pension.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for providing me with the opportunity to speak on the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I will return to the issue of the farm assist scheme.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and thank the Minister for the significant increases which were given in many areas.  We are all big and realistic enough to welcome them.</P>
        <P>Many elderly people gave a great deal of service to the country.  They deserve and need the increases.  I also welcome the increases for dependent children.  For many years nothing happened in this area.  Child poverty is still a major issue and the change made this year is welcome.</P><Col N="109"/>
        <P>The speech made by the T&aacute;naiste last weekend was frightening.  He clearly stated that during the next five years if he is in Government he will create inflation to such an extent we will need another &euro;100 in the pension to cover it.  In this context, one must worry about what the situation will be like for jobs.  The single best way to solve many social welfare problems, particularly for those who are unemployed, is to create and maintain jobs.  Unfortunately, this is an area in which we are in serious crisis.  If it were not for the construction and building industries it is hard to know where the country would be.  Companies such as Motorola and Pfizer are clearly indicating that the cost of production is too high in this country and they want to move somewhere else.  That gives some idea of the crisis we are facing.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I have a keen interest in non-contributory pensions and I tabled questions in the past asking how many people are now in receipt of such pensions.  This would give some idea of whether we need or can justify the hassle associated with it.  What worries me most is the Minister&rsquo;s change of attitude towards those on non-contributory pensions and their line of business.</P>
        <P>If they are prepared to take up, or are already in, a PAYE scheme, people can earn up to &euro;200 a week while still receiving the full non-contributory pension.  If a person is self-employed &mdash; a farmer or small shopkeeper, for example &mdash; he or she can only earn &euro;30 per week or it will be taken from the pension.  I feel strongly about this issue and believe it is immoral and unjust to treat self-employed people in this way.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider the matter.</P>
        <P>It is not justified.  A small shopkeeper could be under severe pressure from Tesco, Super Valu or any of the others but might still want to hold on to the business.  It could be giving a service in a small village or rural area.  If the shopkeeper holds on to the shop or business, whatever little is earned will be taken off the non-contributory pension.  Another person could work at a petrol station as an attendant for a few hours a day, five days a week, earning money.  It does not seem correct.</P>
        <P>I have heard some of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues mention another issue which has been raised with me on occasion, the qualifying adult support.  I welcome the increases in that over the past few years, and it has been raised somewhat.  There is a serious problem for those who were forced out of employment due to the rules of the State.  For example, some of those in Civil Service jobs, Telecom &Eacute;ireann and other places had to retire when they got married.  These people are not entitled to any pension in their own right and feel very aggrieved that they have to depend on their spouse.  In most cases those spouses are extremely good but some spouses are not so minded as a result of alcohol or other factors.  This issue should be considered.</P><Col N="110"/>
        <P>In the same context, some farmers&rsquo; wives and those who were self-employed were never advised when the PRSI contribution was introduced in 1998 that they would have to pay it.  These people took it for granted that they were covered under the self-employment scenario but found, when they were 66, that they were only entitled to be treated as an adult dependant.  These people would have worked hard over their life, behind a shop counter, on a farm or elsewhere, but are not entitled to anything in their own right.</P>
        <P>The issue of non-contributory pensions was raised by one of my colleagues at a meeting last week.  The number of old age non-contributory pensioners put through reviews is alarming.  Such a process is scaring the wits out of people, who worry more about these issues than is justified.  I know that and the Minister knows it.  If a person lives in a rural isolated area and depends on a pension, and is afraid of unforeseen circumstances, I ask that there be a bit more sympathy and courtesy.</P>
        <P>With all due respect, some people are very good in this regard but, unfortunately, others are not the same way inclined.  I have stated many times that I get nothing but the height of courtesy from personnel in the Department of Social and Family Affairs in general, but, unfortunately, it is not always the same at ground level.</P>
        <P>I welcome any change in the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Colleagues and the Minister know that I have exerted pressure, through the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, to have recognition given to widows and widowers especially and people in similar situations who found themselves on a pension but were prevented from getting the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  I welcome the change brought about by the Minister, which the joint committee unanimously asked for a number of years ago.  With the election approaching, it is a good time to get it.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand how it has been extended for another nine months.  All the main social welfare increases were given on 1 January but carers, who are to get half a carer&rsquo;s pension along with the relevant social welfare income, will not get it until 1 September.  I ask the Minister to consider it again at this late stage and, if possible, to pay it from 1 January.</P>
        <P>Only last week a major EU Bill came before the House and we were asked to make it retrospective.  In this case, the amount of money involved would be very small and perhaps the Minister could specify it when summing up.  It would be an appropriate gesture to provide the money.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Keaveney on cross-Border issues and I will not discuss them in the same detail.  I welcome the introduction of cross-Border travel.  There are some extraordinary anomalies, however.  I live in County Monaghan and we do not have a full-time social welfare office, although there several social wel<Col N="111"/>fare offices around the county.  As a public representative, I did not realise until today the technicalities of how they are named and recognised.</P>
        <P>I learned today that a person looking for a free travel pass in the Monaghan social welfare office on Plantation Road would have to travel to Dundalk.  Imagine an old-age pensioner, a disabled person or others having to travel to Dundalk to get a free travel pass.  Will the Minister consider such scenarios and use a bit of common sense?  He should ensure that people, be they in Cavan, Monaghan or elsewhere, can go to not just one place within their counties but a number of places to get such a service.</P>
        <P>Those with ability can tax cars, as well as other things, on-line.  Meanwhile, the oldest of our people are forced to present themselves in another county, a distance of 40 miles, 50 miles or 70 miles away depending on where they live, to get a free travel pass.  The Minister should use his influence to rectify this situation.</P>
        <P>Free travel is a great advantage to those who can use it.  In that context, I welcome the initiatives taken by bodies such as the Latton Development Association which runs the BALTI bus service in parts of County Monaghan, as well as other groups elsewhere which collect elderly persons, including those with hospital appointments and so forth.  We must be more forward thinking and find ways to determine how people in rural areas can use their bus passes.  Several people I know are no longer provided with travel allowances by the Health Service Executive, irrespective of whether they suffer from depression and so on.  They must use some of their limited social welfare payments.  While the payments may look good to those who have houses and friends with whom they can live, if one lives alone and must pay taxi fares to take care of one&rsquo;s health, social welfare payments can disappear quickly.  Will the Minister re-examine the matter and provide a subsidy to cover taxi fares?</P>
        <P>Diet supplement was mentioned by other speakers.  It is an important matter because people with long-term illnesses need proper diets, but often find themselves paying extra costs such as travel.  If they do not have proper diets, the cost to the State will be greater.  We must examine this matter seriously.  There was a cut-back and, while some relief is provided now, it is of limited benefit.</P>
        <P>I support the position on the family as we understand it, namely, the status of marriage and so on, but one cannot ignore the issue of co-habitation and all of the related problems.  I bring this matter to the Minister&rsquo;s attention in the light of a couple of tragic cases I have encountered.  In one case a partner passed away following a serious illness, but his partner had no legal right because there was no marriage bond.  This has major implications for her and her children.  In another case a young man who was killed in an accident left behind a partner and five children, but she <Col N="112"/>has no rights.  Given the significant number in this category, we cannot ignore the issue.  If people have a family together and commitments to each other, we must find a realistic approach.</P>
        <P>Recently a number of young people in receipt of dole payments for a few weeks or months contacted me.  They are being put under tremendous pressure.  I do not disagree with every effort being made to encourage them to find work, but some of the tactics being used are over the top.  When people do not have money to put bread on the table, one must ask major questions.  For better or worse, there are many eastern European workers in Ireland.  I welcome them in the main, but some of the employment opportunities in factories and part-time jobs that used to be available to get young people started are no longer available.  Businesses can get people to work longer hours at relatively cheap rates without obeying the rules.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to be aware of the fact that the young people in question have lives and needs and that they need to be looked after.  I say this in the context of the case of an individual with whom I was friendly.  It is beyond question that he had a drink problem, but he was forced into a situation where he took his own life.  This is not a joke; it is fact.  I sat beside his bed with his father, with whom I spoke about the drink issue.  A few days beforehand the man concerned visited my office and those of others, but our hands were tied.  We must allow a degree of discretion at community welfare officer level to ensure people are not pushed over the top.  To that end, I wish to remark on the matter of the transfer of community welfare officers from the HSE to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I will not get stuck on what should be done, as there may be good reasons for the move, but it is causing much anxiety.  Will the Minister examine all of the issues involved to ensure a sympathetic attitude?  Community welfare officers have provided a significant service and, for many, are the last resort.  We want to ensure the regulations governing their new roles offer freedom and common sense because theirs is an important service.</P>
        <P>I wish to conclude on the issue of separated people.  When canvassing in recent days, I met someone who needed to leave home owing to alcoholism.  The support available to alcoholics is a major issue, but the HSE is not prepared to play a significant role.  The accommodation in which I saw the person concerned would make the Minister&rsquo;s skin creep.  In this day and age, living in a house with water running down the walls and sewage coming up through a lavatory adjacent to a kitchen is unacceptable.  During the next five years whoever is in government must ensure sufficient accommodation is available for separated persons.  Breaking up is traumatic for families.  In most cases men leave home, but sometimes women leave.  Leaving what is in many cases a respectable home and finding oneself in the squalor I witnessed is unacceptable in a coun<Col N="113"/>try that is, according to the T&aacute;naiste, rolling in money and able to throw it away.  It must be used to ensure accommodation is available for those without a home and who find themselves in a difficult situation.</P>
        <P>In general, I welcome the Bill and the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to improve parts of it.  I hope he will take account of the issues raised by me and others in considering where further improvements can be made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Mr. &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute, albeit briefly, on this wide-ranging Bill which will provide for the implementation of improvements in social welfare payments announced in budget 2007 and introduce the excellent proposal in respect of a special rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance to be paid to those in receipt of other social welfare payments.  It is a ground-breaking initiative taken by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and will be of great assistance to many carers.</P>
        <P>Included in the Bill are a number of positive changes to the social welfare system which I will touch on later.  The package of measures introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, however, in the December budget, including the large increase in the State pension already agreed by this House, taken together with the provisions of this Bill, demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to the less well off in society.  I welcome very much the measure introduced in the child benefit scheme allowing greater flexibility in payment arrangements by removing the presumption that a qualifying child should reside only with one parent.  In modern society it is a common occurrence that children live with each parent at different times.</P>
        <P>The increased rates of child benefit over a number of budgets coupled with the radical move in the 2006 budget to introduce the special payment of &euro;1,000 for children under six, has meant families have been given real and substantial support in caring for their children.  Among the changes proposed in this Bill is a provision which will help those in receipt of illness benefit who return to work.  Should such a person find he or she is unable to continue, the Bill will now allow for him or her to re-apply for a restoration of benefit without the requirement of serving waiting days.  This is a very welcome benefit as many people who have suffered from long-term illness may be apprehensive about returning to work lest they be penalised for doing so if they are unable to continue.  This measure will see a net benefit to the Exchequer in the long-run, following its implementation.</P><Col N="114"/>
        <P>A number of welcome technical changes are proposed in the areas of maternity and adoptive benefit, invalidity pension and job seekers&rsquo; allowance among others.   Possibly the most important change contained in the Bill, however, refers to the introduction of a new means-tested payment of up to half the carer&rsquo;s allowance rate, which will be payable to carers who may simultaneously be in receipt of another social welfare payment.  It will be a great boost to the many carers for whom this change will have a positive effect.  The work carried out by so many people in our society in caring for loved ones had been largely unnoticed and unrewarded until the carer&rsquo;s allowance was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il in Government.  This measure, along with a number of other initiatives introduced by this Minister, gives real and substantial recognition, at last, to their vital role in society.  Without the selfless sacrifices made by carers the State would, in every respect, have to fill this very large void at enormous cost to the taxpayer.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government on this crucial initiative.  In this regard I want to refer to comments by Deputy Cuffe earlier when he talked about the Government perhaps having a grudging attitude to the poor, the less well off and those in need of support.  This Government has demonstrated considerable conviction, determination and focus in its work to combat marginalisation and disadvantage and no one more than the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, who has been enormously effective since taking over this brief.</P>
        <P>The change being introduced in respect of supplementary rent allowance was referred to by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  This is another very positive measure in the Bill.  Over the years, we as working public representatives have been constantly aware of poverty traps and disincentives built into the system.  This alteration in the Bill will go some way towards removing one of those poverty traps by allowing a person to retain rent supplement on taking up full time employment.  In many instances people have been forced to remain on social welfare rather than take up an offer of employment for fear of losing rent supplement.  I very much welcome the Minister&rsquo;s initiative in this regard.</P>
        <P>The extension of the household budgeting scheme to include telecommunications services is another positive measure in the Bill.  The household budgeting scheme has played an enormous role in preventing social welfare recipients from incurring rent arrears and this extension of the scheme will be of great benefit.  The Minister has seen fit to introduce a number of amendments to the Pensions Act 1990.  I welcome, in particular, the proposal to bring the trust retirement annuity contracts under the remit of the provisions of the Pensions Act.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the Government has put enormous resources into the welfare and pensions sector over the last ten years, and rightly so.  One only has to compare the rates applicable now <Col N="115"/>to those in receipt of State pensions, child benefit, carer&rsquo;s allowance and all those others dependent in part or wholly on the social welfare system to those that were in place in 1997 to get a picture of the radical changes and real improvements in all of these areas.  This only tells part of the story, however, as all across the system new and imaginative schemes and payments have been introduced, with more included in this Bill.  Others, such as the improved carer&rsquo;s packages and enhanced carer&rsquo;s and child benefit payments were included in earlier budget packages.  Taken in the round, this Minister and his predecessors have much to be proud of in terms of their achievements.</P>
        <P>I am therefore very pleased to note the Government&rsquo;s commitment to enhanced social inclusion in the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  The emphasis in the plan is targeted at encouragement and support for those on social welfare in making that vital transition from welfare payments to active participation in the workforce.  The social inclusion chapter of the national development plan contains funding of almost &euro;50 billion earmarked for tackling the outstanding areas of poverty through targeted action and early intervention.  This enormous investment is based on the approach agreed with the social partners in Towards 2016 and will be co-ordinated in a ten-year national action plan for social inclusion.  I am convinced the approach will see an overall integrated and targeted approach, which I welcome.  The aim of the plan is to create an environment where those currently in receipt of social welfare payments will be encouraged, supported and assisted in every way towards seeking employment.  It is intended that 20% of those on long-term welfare payments will move to employment during the lifetime of the plan.  This ambitious plan will, hopefully, bear fruit and go on to enhance the lives of the many currently dependent on State welfare payments.</P>
        <P>The best way out of poverty is to get a job.  As well as the positive impact such a step has on a person&rsquo;s quality of life and social wellbeing, it brings real benefits to the family and to the community at large.  The national development plan will also see enormous investment in the back to work programme, the main element of which is the allowance scheme that encourages the long-term unemployed to take up work opportunities by allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their social welfare payment plus secondary benefits over three or four years.  This scheme has been highly successful in getting people back into the workforce and I welcome the enormous investment pledged under the national development plan to continue this excellent initiative.  It is an indication of the ongoing commitment that is reflected into today&rsquo;s social welfare Bill.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;590 million is committed to the back to education allowance, designed to help people in receipt of social welfare to enhance their employ<Col N="116"/>ment prospects by improving their education and qualifications.  Again, this programme has proven very successful in lifting many welfare recipients and their families out of poverty and I welcome the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment in this area.  I am sure there is not a Member of the House who is not conscious of the work being done in all our constituencies, in particular by vocational educational committees through their Youthreach and VTOS programmes and indeed by F&Aacute;S in many other locations, where it is actively involved in reaching out to long-term unemployed people who are marginalised in local communities, giving them the prospect and dignity of work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a result of the policies pursued by this Government, 250,000 people have already been lifted out of poverty, including 100,000 children.  However, despite this success the challenge remains to make the extra push that will finally end the scourge of poverty and social exclusion once and for all.  The national development plan has placed the objective of tacking poverty and social exclusion among its primary aims.  This commitment from Government through the national development plan, working with the social partners under the provisions of Towards 2016 has ensured a wide-ranging and targeted programme, without doubt the strongest ever assembled, to fully confront and tackle the remaining poverty and social exclusion that exist in society.</P>
        <P>The national development plan will focus large resources also on the provision of programmes and services for people with disabilities, while &euro;12.6 billion is earmarked for enhanced child care provisions, with a further &euro;9.7 billion set aside for programmes supporting older people.  This massive investment is well justified and badly needed and I have no doubt the drive and commitment shown by the Minister to date in this area will be transferred into ensuring the plan is implemented in full.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to refer to two areas, to which some Members alluded, with which the Minister might deal when replying.  There is widespread interest and concern about the plight of the declining number of women who had to give up employment due to the marriage bar.  As a society we need to do something positive by way of providing pensions for women in that category.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provisions for free travel and acknowledge the work done over many years to provide a free travel facility for people.  However, I wish to highlight the need for a greater degree of flexibility in applying the criteria for the granting of a companion travel pass.  Many people would have been able to avail of free travel had they been granted a companion pass.  I urge the Minister to consider that suggestion.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The Minister has been recep<Col N="117"/>tive to some of the ideas put forward in recent years.  He has brought them to bear in this Bill, albeit not to the full extent I would like, which I will mention shortly.  Nevertheless, he has been progressive.  I welcome the general thrust of the Bill.  I recognise this is a generous package, coupled with the announcements in the budget, and that the total expenditure on social welfare this year will be &euro;15.3 billion, which is a huge investment in our community.  </P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned three specific areas &mdash; child poverty, carers and the status of women.  The status of women and the changes he made in that respect together with provision for carers are issues on which I have focused in recent years.  I spoke to the Minister about a number of provisions I would like introduced in these areas and I am glad he took some of them on board.</P>
        <P>I recognise the increase in the qualified adult allowance, which is now 86.5% of the State non-contributory pension rate.  While it is welcome, it is a double edged sword in that I am disappointed the objective in the programme for Government that it would be 100% of the non-contributory pension rate has not been achieved.  The Minister went on to specify that it will take three more years before this objective is achieved.  In the interests of equality, it is discriminatory that this allowance is not 100% of the State non-contributory pension rate.  I urge the Minister to move forward on that target of three years and to try to fulfil the objective stated in the programme for Government in 2002.</P>
        <P>However, I welcome that for new cases from September direct payments to qualified adults will be made in pension benefits.  Section 14 of the Bill provides that direct payment of the increase for a qualified adult is payable with the State pension directly to a qualified adult for the duration of the period of the entitlement of the State pensioner.  It also states that this will be applicable to the contributory State pension, the transition State pension and the non-contributory State pension, and that it will come into effect in September.</P>
        <P>I welcome this measure but will the qualified adult portion be paid automatically?  For those people who prefer the original option of having it paid jointly to the main recipient, is that something one will have to request?  Otherwise it will be presumed that the qualified adult portion will be paid directly to the qualified adult.  I would like that clarified and for it not to be the case that one must request that the qualified adult portion be paid to the qualified adult.  If that is automatic, I welcome that change.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is nodding, indicating that is the case.  That is hugely important.  If that were not the case, this measure would be of no benefit because the reality is that, unfortunately, some women do not have an income of their own.  I feel strongly about that aspect.  Every woman in the State is entitled to an income of her own, even if that is by way of as a qualified adult where her <Col N="118"/>husband is the main recipient.  Some 95% of qualified adults are women.  That is an important improvement and a matter about which I have spoken to the Minister.  I am delighted he has taken this on board.  It is a major leap forward in social welfare legislation.</P>
        <P>I ask that this measure be extended to other areas over and above what is outlined in section 14.  Is it possible for it to be extended to invalidity, disability and unemployment benefits?  I would welcome the views of the Minister on this issue.  This measure is definitely a step in the right direction and recognises the important role women play in society and that their contribution must be recognised.</P>
        <P>One of the most dramatic changes in the budget has been the provision for carers.  Since 1997, major improvements has been made in this area with the qualifying conditions for the allowance having been eased.  The scheme has been extended.  The carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite grant have been introduced, which are welcome.  These benefits improve the lot of a substantial number of carers and that must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Up to now a recipient could only receive one social welfare payment.  A recipient of another benefit was not eligible for the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  I welcome that a recipient can now be means tested and can receive half of the carer&rsquo;s allowance in addition to a social welfare payment.  This change greatly benefits a large number of people.  The Minister stated: &ldquo;From September, people in receipt of certain other social welfare payments, who are also providing full-time care and attention to a person, will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, subject to their means, up to half the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance&rdquo;.  What are those certain other welfare payments?  Are recipients of lone parents, invalidity, disability and old age pension benefits included?  It would be helpful if the Minister clarified that point.  It is a significant breakthrough.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the increase of &euro;300 in the respite grant to &euro;1,500 from June 2007.  That has eased the plight of many carers and people who are not entitled to carer&rsquo;s allowance but avail of the respite grant.  I know from people who call to my constituency office that it has eased the plight of many carers.  It is important as a society that we recognise the great deal of work carers do in our community.</P>
        <P>A motion dealing with the elderly in my name is listed on the Order Paper for the past two or three months.  It proposes that a full Cabinet Minister be appointed to deal specifically with the elderly, given the large number of issues surrounding our elderly population and the fact that we have an ageing population.  Despite the significant increases in pension benefit in the budget and in recent years, prior to the budget increases, the pension benefit was 34% of the average industrial wage.  That has now increased but, compared to other OECD countries, we are way below the pension benefit paid as a percentage of <Col N="119"/>an industrial wage.  While we can clap ourselves on the back for the huge advances that have been made in recent years, the reality is that the cost of living is a significant issue, particularly for elderly people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have attended many public meetings organised by Age Action Ireland, community groups and elderly groups and cost of living expenses is the number one issue that has been raised.  It is difficult for an older person today to complain about not being able to afford to live.  This issue was raised by people in my town who do not have their own means of transport.  They could not afford to get a taxi to the local supermarket, as the return journey would cost &euro;20.  Making that trip three times a week would cost &euro;60, which would not leave a person in receipt of the State pension much money to spend on himself or herself.  It is not trendy and certainly not cool in the affluent society we live in today to complain about the cost of living and poverty, but it is a real issue for those people.  I ask that it be borne in mind and that perhaps even further advances in increasing the State pension could be made as that would be a more realistic way to address this issue.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to bear in mind a proposal that the fuel allowance be paid all year round and index linked to fuel inflation.  This is one of the issues raised by the elderly.  If we do not listen to the issues they tell us are important to them, we are not in touch with reality.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with an issue mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l that I strongly support.  We must find a way to recognise the years of service given by older women in the community to home duties.  This should be taken into account in calculating pension entitlements.  This might be a little radical, but we must find a mechanism.  The Minister believes the qualified adult payment recognises that women are entitled to an income of their own.  However, this is for a finite number of women.  Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l has mentioned that the marriage ban excluded many women from employment.  We need to do something radical for a finite number of women to make sure they will have a decent pension of their own, in recognition of the child-rearing work they have done during the years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome many aspects of the Bill.  Changes have been made to rent supplement which allow people to work up to a point where they can earn &euro;200 and still claim 50% of the rent allowance.  That is very important because we have been pointing out that this created a poverty trap.  I hope additional improvements will be made, as this measure does not go far enough.  Local authorities have readily admitted that they cannot house people in the same numbers as they did before the Government came to power.  There is now a far greater reliance on the private sector.  We cannot penalise people who find themselves <Col N="120"/>in private rented accommodation at hugely inflated rates by telling them they cannot go to work because they will lose their rent allowance.  Such persons could end up homeless or back in the family home.  I welcome the improvement but it does not go far enough.</P>
        <P>The difficulty with family income supplement is that it is not advertised widely enough and it is not clear enough for people who should be in receipt of it.  Departmental officials know that these people need to be reached.  The delays in assessing applications are unnecessary.  There is even an eight week delay in the renewal of the family income supplement.  We must make the assumption that people are honest and that they will give information on the increase in their income.  They did it in the first place.  Therefore, why would they not do so again?  The situation does not arise where someone pays &euro;400 per week one year and &euro;1,000 the next, yet loses his or her job.  A certain category will be in the low income bracket, which should be assumed.  The renewal should be automatic.</P>
        <P>The Minister and I have had a number of conversations about overpayments to lone parents.  I have made several appeals since last speaking to him and have been successful in each one.  It is a huge waste of time and resources to have appeals heard before deciding officers who recognise that the people concerned would not be before them if they had decided to stay at home and simply accept lone parent allowance.  These are young women who went out to work to improve their circumstances.  There were only 3,000 two years ago.  Therefore, there cannot be that many now.  I appeal to the Minister to take a serious look at the issue and introduce an amnesty.  He would not have to do the same for another group at a later stage, as amnesties have always been ring-fenced.  They are usually for persons who owe the State a vast amount of tax and deliberately decided not to pay.  In this case, we are not talking about deliberate fraud, but something that was simply overlooked.</P>
        <P>Ageism works against the young as well as the old.  People who are widowed and under 65 years with family responsibilities should receive secondary benefits.  It is virtually impossible to live in the circumstances in which they find themselves without these benefits.  This should happen as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>It will be a dire mistake for the Department of Social and Family Affairs to take community welfare officers under its umbrella.  Those officers are front-line staff who are doing what departmental officials cannot do.  They meet people face-to-face and take all of their circumstances into consideration, with the flexibility that is necessary.  I ask the Minister to take a second look at this measure and not to go ahead with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and those Members who took part in the debate <Col N="121"/>which was very positive and informative.  I will try to deal with as many of the issues raised as possible.  </P>
        <P>There was a broad welcome for the thrust of what we are trying to do in the Bill, for which I thank Members.  I will be able to go into much more detail on Committee Stage when we can tease out some of the issues raised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some speakers talked about child benefit and the &euro;10 payment per month.  Child benefit is only one aspect of the budget which this Bill seeks to enact.  However, the child dependant allowance aspect is worth highlighting.  An extra &euro;60 million was made available for targeted payments to families of 342,000 children.  The increased qualified child allowance of &euro;22 is a targeted measure additional to the &euro;140 million child benefit package.  That is important because we last touched these allowances in 1994.  On this occasion I decided to provide an additional &euro;60 million to assist 342,000 children at the lower income level.  In effect, it starts a second-tier payment which the NESC is examining to see how we can bring it to fruition.  The increase in child dependant allowance has given us an opportunity not to have a universal payment.  The &euro;10 payment is universal, but the 342,000 children at the bottom of the scale receive substantially more than this.  I hope that whoever takes this job from me will keep up the determination to assist children on the margins, whatever resources available.  We should not spread them too thinly across society.  We should target them where they are most needed.</P>
        <P>I would like to deal with the issue of child poverty, which was raised by a number of speakers during the debate.  The action plan for social inclusion, which covers the next ten years, was launched this afternoon.  I am aware some Deputies attended part of the launch of the plan, which pulls together the provisions of the new national development plan and Towards 2016.  The new national development plan, under which &euro;50 billion is being allocated for social inclusion, is the first national development plan to provide for a dedicated amount of money in this area and include a social inclusion package.  The document that was launched today outlines how the social inclusion measures of Towards 2016 and the national development plan will be implemented.  As I said at the launch earlier today, the Government has taken 250,000 people, including 100,000 children, out of poverty over the last decade.  The Government has achieved its target, set ten years ago, of reducing the percentage of people in consistent poverty, under the old measure, to 2%.  Similar targets for the next ten years were set today.  I commend the document that was launched today to the House and to the country.  I thank everyone who put so much hard work into it, including the officials in the Office for Social Inclusion and the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>One or two speakers asked me about the new swipe card payments at post offices.  There is no <Col N="122"/>question of people being unable to access their funds as a result of this computer arrangement.  Payments to approximately 46,000 recipients of one-parent family payments have been made through the post office network over the past year, having been transferred from the book payment to the swipe card payment.  The final group to be transferred, which took place in recent weeks, were 550 widows or widowers with children.  There has been some criticism of the provision whereby swipe card payments have to be collected in post offices within 12 days of the due date.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>If customers get in touch with the Department of Social and Family Affairs in advance of their holidays, or after the period of 12 days has elapsed, arrangements will be made to reinstate their payments, as long as they continue to be entitled to them.  While the Department does not think there is any evidence the 12-day rule has caused problems for customers, it is undertaking a full review of the household bill-paying system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister know anyone in receipt of these payments who goes on holidays for 12 days?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ensure that the operation of the 12-day limit is considered as part of the ongoing review.  People should not lose any money as a result of the new computer arrangements.  The new system is voluntary &mdash; people can get their funds in other ways.  The use of the computer programme also has an important anti-fraud element, which will be reviewed.  I hope nobody is disadvantaged by the new arrangements because it is not intended to withhold funds from people who are entitled to them.  I will take account of what has been said in the House and amend these arrangements, if necessary.</P>
        <P>Some Deputies spoke at length about the proposal to transfer certain staff.  Like my colleagues in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, I am hugely supportive of community welfare officers, who are given a substantial budget of approximately &euro;700 million to help people under a range of headings, including health.  They distribute exceptional needs and rent supplement payments etc.  It is not just a health issue &mdash; it is much broader than that.  There is no question of any interference in the work of community welfare officers, who are funded through the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  They will not lose any flexibility or discretion.  Many speakers, including Deputy Penrose, have pointed out that community welfare officers need flexibility because they are in the front line and know what <Col N="123"/>is going on.  I am determined to ensure they retain such advantages.  As the officers, who are paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, provide welfare supports and not just health supports, they have to take a broader view of who needs assistance, particularly as they deal with the challenges presented by this country&rsquo;s immigrant population.  I do not think the question of whether they work for one Department or another should be a major issue.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It sets out to help the customer.  Community welfare officers have nothing to fear from being in such a Department.

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many studies and reports about matters like the development of the welfare state and the creation of a more inclusive labour market have been produced over many years.  This concept was not dreamt up over the last couple of weeks.  It is obvious that everybody is flexing their muscles as the general election approaches.  Talks and industrial relations procedures are ongoing.  I assure community welfare officers that they have nothing to fear from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which is where their professional salaries and their clients come from.  I do not understand why they might want to work for anybody else.  I will use this legislation to ensure the flexibility and independence of these professional people, who provide a fantastic service, are assured.</P>

	<P>There were three meetings in 2006.  I have met the unions.  This matter was discussed at all those meetings.  The national joint council of the health sector, which involves the two trade unions, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children, meets regularly and has discussed the matter.  Officials from the Department met the entire cadre of superintendent community welfare officers in July and November of last year.  A series of regional briefings for the staff of the HSE&rsquo;s community welfare service is being organised by the HSE and the Department.  The first of the briefings, which will provide an opportunity for further constructive engagement and feedback on the implementation programme, will take place next month.  I assure community welfare officers that there will be a full process of constructive engagement and consultation with them about this process, and that their independence and flexibility will be assured by this House in legislation.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The maximum number of ordinary judges of each court is prescribed by law and can only be altered by way of primary legislation.  Legislation currently provides that the number of ordinary judges of the High Court shall not be more than 31.  When I use the term &ldquo;ordinary judges&rdquo; I am referring to judges other than the President of the court in question.  The Bill before the House provides that the maximum number of ordinary judges of the High Court can be increased by four to 35.  The Bill also provides for an increase in the number of ordinary judges in both the Circuit and District Courts.  In the case of the Circuit Court the Bill provides for an increase of four judges from 33 to 37 and in the case of the District Court the Bill provides for an increase of six judges from 54 to 60.  This Bill allows for an increase of 14 more judges which must be a substantial increase in the size of the Judiciary.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Judiciary, collectively and individually.  I have on occasion been represented in the newspapers as attacking the Judiciary.  I have never done so and never would consider doing so.  I have the height of respect for our judges, collectively and individually and I believe they are independent officers under the Constitution and that it would be very unbecoming for a Minister to attack <Col N="126"/>them, either collectively or individually.  I never speak on the outcome of individual cases, although I am often asked to do so.  I have in the past referred to particular aspects of sentencing policy but always in terms which I consider have been measured and respectful of the Judiciary and likewise with respect to bail.  I wish to put on the record of the House that with regard to the controversies about bail, I went out of my way to say that so far as I was concerned, I was not certain whether the problems lay in the manner in which the law was administered on the one hand or whether it was, so to speak, on my side of the fence and in the way cases were being prepared and prosecuted.  I would like the record of the House to show that I never attacked the Judiciary, either collectively or individually and that I respect and honour the Judiciary as a group of men and women who are serving this country very well under the Constitution, that I admire their independence and independence of spirit and that I know each and every one of them does his or her utmost to be loyal to the declaration they make on assuming office which is to uphold the law and the Constitution.</P>
        <P>I am promoting this legislation because I believe the appointment of additional judges is required to deal with delays and to generally speed up the judicial process.  I am also taking this measure to strengthen the criminal justice system in the context of a package of measures now in train to deal with serious crime.</P>
        <P>I have taken the following factors into account in coming to this decision to appoint 14 extra judges.  The President of the High Court has indicated to me that he wishes to appoint additional judges to minimise waiting periods in the Central Criminal Court and also to speed-up judicial review cases, in particular, review cases arising from major infrastructural projects.</P>

	<P>They are on their way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the apology included in the script?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No, Deputy.  It is not an apology.  The statement I have just made is for the record of the House because it is important that when one has an opportunity to talk about the Judiciary without being interrupted, without being misquoted and without being selectively quoted, that one tells the truth.</P>
        <P>In the case of the Circuit Court, cases are becoming more complex and as a consequence they are lengthier.  The available judges are allocated by the President of the Circuit Court in such a way as to minimise backlogs in criminal cases.  However, this has a knock-on effect on civil and family law business.  As a result, cases in some circuits are taking up to two years to reach <Col N="127"/>court and this is not acceptable.  The workload of the District Court is also becoming more complex and lengthy.  In particular, additional judges are required in order to fully implement the provisions of the Children Act 2001, which the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is implementing in full.  The population of the State is increasing, Garda numbers are at an all-time high and we are living through a period of economic prosperity.  All of these factors impact on the courts in their own way.</P>
        <P>I think it appropriate at this stage to make some comments on the courts system.  The establishment of the Courts Service as an independent agency in 1999 represented the most radical re-organisation of court services since the foundation of the State.  The mission statement of the agency is &ldquo;to manage the courts, support the judiciary and provide a high-quality and professional service to all the courts&rdquo;.  There is probably general agreement that the Courts Service is fulfilling this task admirably.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Apart from judicial salaries which are paid from the central fund, I am responsible for ensuring the service is adequately funded and, in this regard, &euro;102.8 million has been provided in 2007 for the Courts Service.  This represents a 20% increase on 2006. Since its foundation, the service has made great progress in improving the stock of courthouses around the country.  Many of our county town courthouses have been refurbished and other major upgrading works have been completed in Cork, Limerick, Dundalk and Castlebar.  Some county courthouses remain to be refurbished but the courthouse estate has been fantastically refurbished and some are magnificent buildings which are a source of pride to their local communities.  The allocation for capital works on courthouses for this year stands at &euro;29.6 million, which is &euro;10 million more than the previous year.  Courthouse refurbishment projects due for completion this year include the magnificent courthouse at Nenagh, the courthouses in Tullamore, Fermoy, Thurles and a new courthouse at Blanchardstown.  In addition, a maintenance fund for courthouse repairs, comprising &euro;11.7 million, is allocated for 2007.  This fund includes &euro;4 million for minor works and is designed to ensure our courthouse stock is maintained in good condition in keeping with its role as the public expression of the importance of the administration of justice in the State.</P>
        <P>A new criminal courts complex in Dublin will be the first PPP project undertaken in the justice family.  The new state-of-the-art complex will be constructed on a State-owned site in Parkgate Street adjacent to Heuston railway station.  It will be developed in accordance with best practice on similar projects elsewhere.  The new complex is due to be completed in 2009.  The building will be designed to concentrate all central Dublin criminal business in one serviced location.  This will involve the transfer of courts and administrative <Col N="128"/>offices from three jurisdictions, District Court, Circuit Court and Central Criminal Court, to the new facility.  The new complex will contain an underground point of entry for prisoners, appropriately equipped holding cells, victim support facilities, separate jury and witness facilities, press and media centre, consultation and waiting areas and cafeteria.  The centralising of all criminal business in the new complex will also mean the Four Courts complex will be freed up for civil business.  Approval has been given to the Courts Service to proceed with nine other greenfield court projects, by way of the PPP system, as part of a new envelope of &euro;50 million for such projects over the next two years.  These include full District and Circuit Court services for locations nationwide.  The Courts Service will use a new investment methodology known as bundling.  This approach allows the marketplace a flexibility to bid for group or individual schemes, generating best value for the taxpayer and early delivery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the appointment of additional judges will also assist in the fight against organised crime.  As Deputies will be aware, last December I announced a comprehensive package of measures to deal with this fight.  I will set out the components of this package which includes a further increase of 1,000 in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to bring the total up to 15,000 over the next three years; sanction for 300 additional civilian administrative support posts for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the recruitment of seven senior civilian posts recommended in the recent reports from Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole and Senator Maurice Hayes; an increase in the retirement age for garda&iacute;, sergeants and inspectors from 57 to 60 years; a proportionate increase in the targeted strength of the Garda Reserve from 900 to 1,500; and increased staffing for the Forensic Science Laboratory, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts Service.  I wish to emphasise there will be no limit on the funds available for the witness protection programme.  Unprecedented resources have been devoted in recent years to the criminal justice system and these measures follow from this policy.  These have been accompanied by a comprehensive programme of modernisation and reform.</P>
        <P>I will bring before the House in the near future a package of proposals to specifically counter the gangland and drug culture.  I will deal with the details at a later stage.  The copies of my script which have been supplied to Deputies carry this information.</P>
        <P>Sentencing is, of course, a complex matter and there are many variable factors to be taken into account in each individual case.  However, in order to address the issue, the board of the Courts Service established a steering committee in October 2004 to plan for and provide a system of information on sentencing.  The initiative of the board is designed to provide a systemic form of information as a reference point for judges.  The terms of reference are to plan for and provide <Col N="129"/>information on sentencing.  The membership of the committee is as follows: Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, chairperson; Mr. Justice Kevin O&rsquo;Higgins; Mr. Justice Esmond Smyth; Judge Miriam Malone, and Professor Tom O&rsquo;Malley.</P>
        <P>The steering committee has reviewed sentencing systems around the world and decided to establish a pilot project in the Circuit Court in Dublin.  The objectives of the project are, first, to identify criteria and other information employed by the Judiciary in sentencing for particular offence types in criminal proceedings; second, to record and retrieve such information in individual cases; third, to design and develop a database to store the information retrieved and enable its retrieval in accordance with various search criteria; fourth, to share or disseminate the information, utilising information and communications technology, via a judges&rsquo; intranet or other means, and, fifth, to assemble appropriate material on sentencing for a bench book and website.  Briefing meetings to explain the project have been held with the judges of the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and court registrars involved in the initial phase of the pilot project.</P>
        <P>A pilot project commenced in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court in January.  I understand two researchers have begun to collect and collate information on sentencing outcomes in cases on indictment in designated courts in accordance with criteria specified by the committee.  It is anticipated the pilot project will run for an eight-week period and that it will be evaluated prior to a further pilot project.</P>
        <P>Apart from the pilot project, one must not ignore the current position which is that the law enables a judge to exercise his or her discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he or she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and circumstances of the accused.  Our system of recruitment to all levels of the Judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in experienced and trained legal practitioners.  Consequently, judges, on appointment, have a wide knowledge of the law and its application.</P>
        <P>Work on the scheme of the judicial council Bill is at an advanced stage of development in my Department and I expect to be in a position to bring it to Government for approval early this year.  The Bill will establish a judicial council with responsibility for a number of matters.  Among these, the council will devise a code of ethics and investigate complaints about judicial misbehaviour.  An important feature of the disciplinary process is that lay people, that is, people who are not judges or lawyers, will be involved in the process.  The council will also be responsible for judicial education and training and the exchange of information among judges on such matters as sentencing.</P>
        <P>The Bill will build on the report of the committee on judicial conduct and ethics, chaired by the former Chief Justice, Mr. Ronan Keane.  That <Col N="130"/>report recognised the need for a procedure to deal with complaints of judicial misconduct which, while serious, might not warrant the ultimate sanction of impeachment by the Oireachtas.  Consultations on the proposed Bill have, as is usual, taken place with the Office of the Attorney General.  I have also considered it prudent, given the nature of the subject, to consult the Chief Justice.  These consultations are ongoing and I hope they will conclude quickly.  When the scheme of the Bill has been approved by Government, I intend to make it available to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  Any views that may emerge from that committee can be taken into account during the drafting of the Bill which will be proceeding at the same time.</P>
        <P>There is little use in having extra judges and a well resourced courts system if many people are, in effect, priced out of the legal process.  The issue of legal costs is one which I have always believed was worthy of investigation.  Deputy Cassidy, as Chairman, called me before the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on one occasion to ask me what I proposed to do in this regard.  On foot of that hearing, I established the legal costs working group, chaired by Mr. Paul Haran, a retired senior civil servant, to examine the issue.</P>
        <P>There are three main strands to that group&rsquo;s report.  First, it recommends the following: a legal costs regulatory body to formulate recoverable cost guidelines based on an assessment of the amount of work reasonably required to be done in typical cases; a simplified assessment process, based on the recoverable cost guidelines prescribed by the regulatory body, to be carried out by a legal costs assessment office where legal bills are disputed; and, where assessments are appealed, an appeals process conducted by an appeals adjudicator.  Second, the report calls for significant improvements to be made in the quality and quantity of the information that a solicitor is required to provide for clients and the manner in which it is to be supplied.  Third, the report recommends a number of legislative and procedural changes to reduce delays in court hearings and generally designed to expedite the legal process.</P>
        <P>After I secured the Government&rsquo;s endorsement of the report&rsquo;s recommendations, I established an expert group, chaired by the accountant, Mr. Desmond Miller, to advise me on the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  I have now received the implementation advisory group&rsquo;s report and will be making a further announcement on it in the next couple of weeks.  I have no doubt that once the new costs arrangements have been put in place, the market for civil legal services will become more predictable, consistent and transparent to consumers.  This will lead to the market becoming more economic, as people will be in a position to shop around and exert some downward pressure on legal costs and <Col N="131"/>bills presented to them.  This transparency will also make it easier for consumers to recognise competitive prices for the services they require.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before turning to the provisions of the Bill, I want to mention what I consider to be an exciting development.  The Courts Service recently launched its first report on family law proceedings, Family Law Matters.  This will be the first in a series of reports which are a Courts Service initiative to shine a light on the family courts and dispel myths and misunderstandings which may arise from an historical lack of information in this very relevant and human arena of law.  This initiative was permitted by a change to the <i>in camera</i> rule which I introduced in legislation earlier in this D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Dr. Carol Coulter was engaged to carry out the reporting of family law on a pilot basis.  The staff of the service provided tremendous assistance and information for her in producing this report for the public.  The report provides information under three headings: reports, trends and statistics, and judgments.  The reports are newspaper-style records of what happened in a bundle of cases across the country.  The identity of participants is totally protected and the area of law examined is explained in accessible and useable language.  I congratulate Dr. Coulter on the quality of that work and the Courts Service for the way in which it has supported her work.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a simple one.  Section 1 deals with definitions.  Section 2 increases the number of High Court judges from 31 to not more than 35, an increase of four.  Section 3 deals with Circuit Court judges and increases their number to 37, an increase of four.  Section 4 provides that the number of judges of the District Court, in addition to the President of the District Court, shall be not more than 60, an increase of six.  Section 5 is a technical provision which, simply put, makes the additional judges of the District Court unassigned judges rather than assigning them to particular districts.  As such, the six additional judges can be allocated by the President of the District Court as she sees fit.  Section 6 sets out the Short Title and collective citation.  Given the size of the Bill, there is little more I can say about its text.</P>
        <P>I hope the Bill will command cross-party support.  It is not contentious; it provides for additional judges and will assist in reducing delays in the courts and generally speed up the judicial process.  It complements the measures being taken in regard to organised crime.  It will result, I hope, in earlier trials and bring the level of judicial resources to a record high.  In the circumstances I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister opened his remarks with what can only be described as an abject apology for his foghorn public criticism of judges.  I want to open my remarks by referring to a matter I regard as even more serious, <Col N="132"/>namely, the arrest today of a recognised journalist from a reputable newspaper.  I understand this arrest arises from an article written in that newspaper last August.  Ireland has had a unique relationship with the press and a long tradition of freedom of speech.  The arrest of a recognised journalist from a reputable newspaper in the course of his duty is, therefore, a hugely serious matter.  This case calls for a statement from the Government.  I raised the issue with the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il this morning but he declined to comment.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, needs to clarify the issues surrounding the arrest.  The arrest of a journalist is no ordinary matter, if we believe in freedom of speech and the freedom of the press.  However, the case is somewhat unique, thankfully, and requires to be dealt with as such.  The Minister needs to clarify what is at issue.  He needs to explain to the House and the public how much he was aware of in regard to the matter.  He must also tell us whether he had a role in a situation where, apparently, an arrest arose as a result of a matter leaked to the media.  I seek the Minister&rsquo;s statement on this, particularly because the Minister himself has a recognised reputation as a leaker to the media.  I recall the leaking of confidential Garda documents to a national newspaper about another journalist with whom he disagreed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just completing it.  I also recall a draft Bill which I arranged to lodge in the Bills Office and which was sent over to the Minister&rsquo;s office &mdash; dealing with issues surrounding the chaos created last year about child rapists walking free &mdash; and next thing I saw it on the front of a newspaper, leaked by this Minister.  He owes a full statement to the public as to what is going on in this case.  The journalist is still under arrest and the House and the country want to know why.</P>
        <P>The Minister tells us he wants more judges.  I have been saying we need more judges for a long time.  Part of the problem with our criminal justice system is that we are short of judges.  Why was the issue not being dealt with long ago?  We also need to deal with two related issues.  First, is it correct that we have the lowest number of judges per head of population in Europe and, if so, why do we allow that situation to continue?  Second, this Bill further limits the number of judges because while it increases their number, it provides an upper limit.  Why do we need an upper limit under legislation for judges?  Why is it not within the Government&rsquo;s remit to appoint judges when required?  This question has often intrigued me.  Perhaps, when dealing with the more serious issues I have raised, the Minister will also deal with this question in his reply.  It would be worth getting a response on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="133"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Judges&rsquo; salaries are a charge on the Central Fund and, therefore, there must be legislation underpinning their appointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have tabled amendments and I suggest the Minister adopts them because in this situation, with it being a charge on the Central Fund, the Opposition cannot get amendments accepted.  Why do we not increase the number of judges to a much higher number so that they can be appointed when required?  Why do we set a limit?</P>
        <P>Despite the increasing crime we have seen in Ireland in recent years and the falling detection rates, there is still a record number of cases going before the courts.  The waiting lists for cases to be heard are getting longer.  There are unacceptable delays in the criminal courts and one of the reasons is the lack of judges.  No matter how hard they work &mdash; some work very hard &mdash; they cannot keep up with the pace of dealing with crime.</P>
        <P>This brings me to the earlier comments of the Minister on the Judiciary.  It is not appropriate for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day to publicly excoriate judges for populist reasons.  There are plenty of opportunities for the Minister to convey his remarks to the President of the District Court if he considers it appropriate.  It does not add anything to our democratic system to have what amounts to a public stand-off between the Minister and the Judiciary.  Either judges will not be able to respond or they will have to make comments that it would be better for them not to have to make.  This is not the way to do business.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister was encouraged by polls that suggested judges are imposing sentences that are too lenient.  He should examine his conscience in this regard.  Does he not realise that with regard to sentences it is, to a large degree, the Oireachtas that has a role?  I am not talking about the issue of minimum mandatory sentences, but about assisting judges to get a consistent sentencing policy.  However, we have not done so.  The minimum judges should have available is a database of sentences.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael Party, supported by the Labour Party, debated a Bill in the House and argued for the establishment of such a register of sentences, but it was voted down by the Government.  The least we could have, as other countries have, is a database that would establish the basic things judges should know when dealing with a particular crime.  Such a database would allow them refer to similar offences in the past and is the minimum that should be available if we want consistency in sentencing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to go far beyond that point.  In the same way as happens in parliaments in other common law countries, the House should establish sentencing tariffs.  I would like to see a situation where a maximum and a minimum sentence are established by the Oireachtas.  This happens in virtually every other common law juris<Col N="134"/>diction, including England, Wales, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa.  Why do we continue as we are here?  Why do we not accept the fact that there is no need to reinvent the wheel and do what has worked in other countries?</P>
        <P>Regarding sentencing policy,  I would like to see tariffs established and guidelines provided for maximum and minimum sentences.  Also, because we must respect the independence of the Judiciary to go above or below the tariffs, I would like to see a situation where judges would be required to explain why they went outside the tariffs.  This would not interfere with the independence of the Judiciary, but would put an onus on them to explain their reasons for not imposing a minimum tariff or for going beyond the maximum guideline.</P>
        <P>It is ludicrous for us to continue with a situation in our courts where the prosecution counsel is not allowed a view after conviction on what the sentence should be.  Some years ago we introduced a measure, which I favoured and supported, whereby the DPP could appeal against the leniency of sentences.  It is ludicrous that the DPP can make such an appeal, yet his counsel in the court is not allowed a view as to what the sentence should be after conviction at the primary hearing.  This situation should not be allowed to continue.</P>
        <P>We need to face up to the issues that arise here, but the Government has not done so.  It has not faced the issues raised by consecutive and concurrent sentencing nor has it faced the issues with regard to an area about which I feel strongly, namely, the situation where somebody who receives a sentence of eight years from Judge Carney in the Central Criminal Court is brought to Mountjoy or wherever and his sentence is reduced automatically to six years.  This surely is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>I do not believe in automatic remission of sentences, although this is not to say there should not be remission of sentences.  I am not trying to play the hard man, but the remission should be earned.  A change should be introduced to ensure prisoners earn their remission.  Let them be given an incentive to earn remission.  We must incentivise good behaviour and those who in the past rejected efforts made to rehabilitate them because there was nothing to be gained from participating in rehabilitation programmes.  These are some of the changes I want to see applied before we appoint extra judges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we appoint new judges, we must give them the necessary supports.  Is the Government, in the short time left to it, prepared to ensure the effectiveness of the Courts Service?  If the Courts Service has more judges as is necessary, there needs obviously to be an increase in the support staff in each of the courts affected by this Bill.  That means a new court registrar for each of the 14 new judges who the Bill proposes to introduce and a proportionate increase in staff in the differ<Col N="135"/>ent court offices so judges are not frustrated by administrative delays and back office pile ups.</P>
        <P>Often I have worried about matters such as the delay in the issue of reserve judgments.  I acknowledge the Minister took some steps in that regard, but I understood that much of the problem was to do, first, with a lack of judges so that judges needed to be continually on the bench and did not have the time off to write up their judgments as happens in other courts and, second, a lack of even simple secretarial facilities and administrative back-up.  As we are discussing judges, that is an issue that should be dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have sanctioned 18 extra support staff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased that step has been taken because it makes effective the step we are taking in this Bill, which I support.  For once I support the Minister.</P>
        <P>As we are speaking of judges, I want to raise another issue.  It is imperative that judges keep abreast not just of developments in the law, but also of trends in practice and social norms.  I am a great believer in judicial independence which is a fundamental pillar of our democratic system, but I also believe that judicial independence requires a well-trained and well-prepared Judiciary.  We cannot really expect judges to be consistent and effective in sentencing if they do not receive the appropriate education or training in the matter.</P>
        <P>Few professionals operate in practice without ongoing professional development.  For example, members of the Bar, in theory, are expected to submit themselves to a specified number of hours of education periodically.  I am aware that members of my side of the profession, solicitors, are expected to do likewise.  Looking at the circumstances of judges, however, on the Wednesday of one week one could be pleading a case before the court and on the Wednesday of the following week the same person could be hearing another case.  We operate on the basis of no formal training being available to judges and I wonder is that appropriate.  In other countries under the continental code, being a judge is a profession in its own right.  As they begin their career as judges and train to be judges, that issue does not arise.  However, we operate a different system where we rely solely on appointing those who are practitioners, either as barristers or solicitors, and it is up to them to equip themselves with what is needed to provide a vital public service.</P>
        <P>At the very least, in order to implement international best practice, judges should be able to undergo a specified amount of training every year.  I accept the Judicial Studies Institute runs worthwhile and valuable seminars and lectures, but I understand the format of this training is far from focused and its <i>ad hoc</i> nature may mean it <Col N="136"/>effectively fails to address important issues of every day concern to members of the Judiciary.</P>
        <P>Judicial training could include a variety of subjects designed not only to improve knowledge but, importantly, also to change attitudes.  I do not underestimate either the intelligence or knowledge of judges, but from time to time one would raise questions about their attitude.</P>
        <P>In many countries judicial education exercises attitudinal change to improve judicial integrity or to eliminate hidden bias on gender or ethnic issues.  Managing this type of training is critical.  Overall control and direction of judicial training could be in the Judiciary&rsquo;s hands or training could be provided by separate entities such as law schools or judicial training institutes managed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Let us be clear.  Judges do not operate alone.  They are the front men and women for a substantial administration that is our criminal justice system.  It is an imperfect system.  It works well in the majority of cases.  In recent years we have become aware of flaws in that system and as crime increases these flaws become more obvious.  The Irish criminal justice system suffers from issues of accountability and transparency.  However, Article 34.1 of the Constitution requires that justice be administered in public subject to certain restrictions with regard to family law, rape and other cases.  Although the hearing of the case and the sentencing of convicted persons takes place in public people are still left with the lingering feeling that they do not see all that goes on.  We need to work harder to counter that feeling and we need to show citizens that justice is not only administered in public, but transparently for everyone to see.</P>
        <P>I support the increase in the number of judges.  I support, in particular, the idea of increasing the number of criminal judges.  The Bill does not go far enough.  I would like to see the number increase further and even if they are not immediately appointed, it would save us in the next Government the trouble of having to introduce a further Bill when we want to appoint judges, which we probably will do at an early stage.  The Minister might consider that before we complete the debate on this Bill.</P>
        <P>In his concluding remarks, I also want the Minister to deal with the issue of fundamental concern to me, that is, the issue of freedom of speech and the arrest of a journalist.  That needs to be fully clarified.  I understand the journalist concerned is still under arrest.  I further understand that the <i>Evening Herald</i> editor, Stephen Rae, stated on the &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; this evening that last week he was interviewed by garda&iacute; who stated they were there on foot of a complaint from the Minister.  If that is so, the Minister should explain the situation now.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="137"/>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>There is very little in the Bill.  It is about increasing numbers in an area where clearly there is a need for increased personnel.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s speech was wide-ranging.  I suppose he felt the Bill was short and he had to go into all sorts of other areas.  He told us halfway through his speech that he would not go into the entire package on criminal activities, between drugs and guns, which he would introduce, but he did not need to because the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, gave us that last week when speaking about a European directive, although it had nothing to do with it.  We need to take that into consideration when Opposition Members are asked to stick strictly to the script.  I just wish that sometimes the Chair &mdash; not the Acting Chairman, Deputy Woods, lest he think that I refer to him &mdash; would ask the Government to do the same.</P>
        <P>One or two points need to be made.  The arrest of a journalist today is a worrying and disturbing action on behalf of the State.  Whoever&rsquo;s word or complaint the garda&iacute; arrived on behalf of, it is very worrying for a journalist to be arrested.  The arrest of a journalist following a report as a result of leaks, which clearly could have come only from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Garda, is a matter which needs a full explanation.  That is very worrying.</P>
        <P>All I can think about is that the only person jailed in respect of the beef tribunal was the journalist who did the State some service.  This shows where our priorities lie.  The matter requires a full and frank discussion and explanation and the journalist in question needs to be released.</P>
        <P>Family law did not become a major issue until women acquired financial independence.  It was very limited initially and is still limited.  Financial independence came in the form of a package which included deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit.  Frank Cluskey introduced the measure.  Regardless of whether financial independence was regarded as good or bad, it gave women the courage and ability to live separately from their husbands.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of financial independence for women, report after report has stated family law needs to be separated from the rest of the legal service in terms of practice and the physical environment.  Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe spoke about judges with experience in one area having to work in others.  It is astonishing that a judge may have to decide on cases involving criminal activity in the morning and on delicate and sensitive cases concerning child custody, residency and access rights, as well as maintenance payments in the afternoon.  One does not need full knowledge of the entire legal system to work in the family law service.  Rather, one must be sufficiently sensitive and have sufficient advocacy skills to be a good judge in this area.  We should start to ensure this is the case.</P>
        <P>I occasionally attend court cases to support those involved.  While I find that judges do a very <Col N="138"/>good job in general, we should put in place a fitness to practice committee for the Judiciary, just as we have done for the medical profession.  It would not be called on very often.  A very recent high profile case concerning a particular judge could probably have been dealt with far more effectively in such a committee, given the many delays that occurred during the hearings.  Fitness to practice measures would be of great benefit to the legal system and we should consider them very seriously.</P>
        <P>The main problem with the legal system does not concern judges&rsquo; lists because judges deal with a spectacular amount of work, far more than most of us give them credit for.  The logjam actually arises in the preparation of the book of evidence for serious cases.  How many times have we heard that a book of evidence was not ready?  Clearly, we need extra judges but we should realise the logjams occur when cases are not ready to go to trial.  We should consider this issue seriously.</P>
        <P>I am greatly concerned about access to the legal system.  It is no accident that the majority of those on limited means have their cases heard in the lower courts, while the majority of those with excessive means have theirs heard in the higher courts.  There is an old saying that one will get as much law as one can pay for.  Some can pay a lot.  We must come to terms with the question of access for those who feel aggrieved and those who believe they have been dealt with unjustly by the system.  No one wants to go to court and it is the last place anyone wants to be, but when one has no recourse other than through the courts, access should be made as easy as possible.</P>
        <P>The Minister rightly began his contribution with a gushing apology.  It is disgraceful for any Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to criticise judges, although we may all feel like doing so.  The separation of powers is sacrosanct and is as much to protect us, as legislators, as it is to protect members of the Judiciary.</P>
        <P>The first quality a judge should have, apart from the ability to do his or her job, is compassion.  Court cases have always focused on how the defendant behaved and how the evidence was presented.  We should not be rushing to impose a ten year sentence for one crime and ten for another.  This attitude gave us the Birmingham Six and Dean Lyons cases.  Absolutism in the administration of the law can lead to very bad decisions and this needs to be taken on board.  Most judges, with a few rare exceptions, do an exceptional job, as do solicitors who offer to defend people whom no other will defend.  Sean O&rsquo;Leary said there was no longer a defence for those we did not find acceptable in society.  We should take this to heart.</P>
        <P>The system, for all its flaws, is as good as we have got and in that regard, I keep reminding people that when we make laws, we do not do so only for the guy who will go out tonight to do heroin deals but also for ourselves.  The law will apply to us and we need to keep this in mind.  We <Col N="139"/>are not opposing the Bill.  More judges may be required but the bottleneck is at the point of preparation of cases.</P>
        <P>There are other matters we should examine, including the separation of family law from other aspects of law.  It does not need to involve the high-tech, expensive administration of law one sees in the higher courts.  If, however, people want to go to the High Court and have enough money to do so, God bless them.  The family law system should comprise a separate element of the legal system.</P>
        <P>We should consider seriously the establishment of a fitness to practice committee.  It would not have to sit permanently and could just be a roll-over committee before which individuals could be called.  It is essential that it be established.  We all know why this is the case and do not have to outline the details.</P>
        <P>The Minister is correct that we have absolutely magnificent courthouses in which the law is applied.  However, some do not afford physical access to many individuals with disabilities.  Sometimes physical access is as important as material access and this should be considered.</P>

	<P>I do not suppose anybody wants to end up in court if he or she does not have to but very often it is a necessity.  Clearly, a court should function well and punctually.  Family law cases are the poor relations of the legal system.  Significant distress is created for families when they have to put their lives on hold for up to three years before getting closure on failed relationships.  I hope this Bill, which I support, will reduce the length of time people have to wait before having their cases heard.  Mediation is a preferable approach to family law, although it does not work for everyone.</P>
        <P>The conditions in which some of our courts operate are unacceptable.  I could rehearse some examples of this problem in my constituency.  Investment is needed urgently because we cannot expect people to work in unsatisfactory environments.</P>
        <P>Positive developments have been made recently in terms of victim impact statements, which have improved the legal experience for some people.  Victims in criminal cases have been made to feel more important to the system and some younger judges have accepted these developments in a proactive manner, with good results.</P>
        <P>If there are insufficient judges, there will not be enough time for best practice or retraining.  Pressurised case loads are in nobody&rsquo;s interest.  This Bill is simple in that it sets out the number of additional judges to be put in place.  I note they will be provided support facilities, which is <Col N="140"/>equally important.  I hope the Bill will make a difference in terms of reducing the timeframe for cases because the unacceptable delays in family law cases put additional pressure on families which are already facing difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Courts and Courts Officers (Amendment) Bill 2007.  It is a relatively innocent Bill which provides for an increase in the number of High Court judges from 31 to 35, Circuit Court judges from 33 to 37 and District Court judges from 54 to 60.</P>
        <P>However, given the furore that has surrounded the Judiciary in recent months, the Bill could be about much more than this.  Last Christmas, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform missed the event of the year when he was snubbed by bigwigs who refused to sup wine with him at the table of plenty because he had made utterances disliked by judges.  As the intelligentsia do when they are challenged, the judges went into a huff and sulked in the corner until St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day.  By then, the wine was consumed and the Minister had to go without.  My comments are intended to refer to some but not all judges.  If for no other reason than the snub delivered to the Minister last Christmas, I expected him to bring legislation which would deliver messages to the Judiciary that reflected the views of ordinary, down-to-earth and law abiding citizens.  Unfortunately, he did not do so.</P>
        <P>I suggest the additional judges provided for in this legislation are appointed not only for their expertise in the law but also because they come from ordinary backgrounds.  It seems that some judges regard themselves as almost infallible but as far as I know, the only person on earth who has any credibility in making such a claim is the Pope and even he had to issue an apology recently.</P>
        <P>This legislation could have required judges to undergo training in the dispensation of justice.  I do not feel competent to refer to any particular case but I listen regularly to the criticisms of the performance of judges made by people involved in crime prevention.  I am also aware that some lawyers attempt to organise their cases in ways that avoid judges who, for example, may be regarded as being harsh on particular issues.  That should not happen.  Justice should be dispensed in a uniform, fair and transparent manner but the only way to achieve that aim is to provide standardised training to judges.  I am sure some judges would be mortified at the notion of undergoing a course of instruction upon their appointment but the common good should come before the feelings of the Judiciary.  Regardless if the method used, we need to achieve uniformity in the actions of judges.  As a start, judges should be appointed to deal with specific aspects of the law according to the areas in which they worked before their appointment to the bench.  In some of our courts, judges have to deal with diverse <Col N="141"/>issues, even though they cannot be expected to be expert in every area of the law.</P>
        <P>I wish to address the need for improvements to existing courthouses and the construction of new ones.  I raise this issue not only for the good of judges but also for all the people who work in courthouses, as well as the general public.  The Courts Service is dragging its feet on the provision of a new courthouse for Tuam in my constituency of Galway East.  Some time ago, the old courthouse had to be closed on health and safety grounds.  A temporary facility which was constructed to hold the court remains in place but no progress has been made on permanent accommodation.  A property adjoining the courthouse is for sale and, while the Courts Service has apparently deemed it suitable, it has shown no urgency in acquiring it or any other property for use as a courthouse.  I hold no brief for the vendor of the property and do not care where the courthouse is located, provided it is within the town boundary.  It would make eminent sense to locate it beside the Garda station but, unbelievably, the Courts Service refused an offer of such a site from Galway County Council.  That alone should prompt questions about who, if anybody, is making decisions on Tuam courthouse.  Action is needed now to develop a proper and permanent courthouse in the hub town of Tuam.  I ask the Minister to intervene with the Courts Service on this matter, given that it accords with the designation in the national spatial strategy of Tuam as a hub town.</P>

	<P>Deputy Howlin raised two issues with me concerning the amendment moved by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to Second Stage of the Bill.  I can confirm that if the amendment is passed tonight, the Bill will be automatically deemed to have passed Second Stage in six months time, when the Bill would appear on the next Order Paper at order for Committee Stage.  On the dissolution of the D&aacute;il, all Bills before the House will lapse.  Needless to mention, the Chair is not required to consider the impact of the dissolution of the D&aacute;il when ruling on an amendment.</P><Col N="143"/>
        <P>As for the second issue in respect of the ruling cited by the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>For clarity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should allow me to continue.  The second issue is in respect of the ruling cited by the Deputy, namely, that it is not for the Chair or the House to decide whether a Bill is in conflict with the Constitution.  That is correct and is the case.  Only the courts may determine such matters, as stated in other relevant rulings.  However, of itself this does not require the Chair to rule on the Government amendment on Second Stage.  The amendment puts forward reasons and opinion as to why the Bill should be postponed.  There is no procedural reason to oblige the Chair to rule on the amendment.  It would be inappropriate for the Chair to so do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept fully the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling in respect of the first issue.  Am I to understand the import of the amendment is simply to defeat the Bill?  Is that what the Chair is telling Members?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not for the Chair to interpret.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>However, that is the truth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the House to decide.  On the Bill, I call Deputy Andrews.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Fiona O&rsquo;Malley and O&rsquo;Connor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I greatly welcome the opportunity to debate this issue.  I have been interested in the subject for a long time, as has the Fianna F&aacute;il Party which has had major discussions on the issue.  In recent years the Taoiseach has taken a major interest in it, particularly during the lifetime of the Government.  However, Members must be honest with themselves in respect of progress made on the issue during the past five years.  It is a pity that the Government has not introduced legislation on the issue of civil union or civil registration of partnerships of same-sex couples.</P>
        <P>The Minister noted yesterday that the Bill was very short.  I have not had the opportunity to pick through it forensically.  However, the point he made about the comparison with the United Kingdom Bill was compelling.  At its core is a bundle of rights that the vast majority accept should be enjoyed by same-sex couples.  These rights are basic and heterosexual couples might take them for granted or may not even be aware of them.  They certainly do not recall when such <Col N="144"/>rights were granted to them.  I refer to pension rights, inheritance rights and tax entitlements, all of which we take for granted.  Consequently, it is unfortunate that three years after publication of the Law Reform Commission report on the rights and duties of cohabitees, there is still no legislation in this respect.  The commission reported extensively on the issue of same-sex couples and the rights they should enjoy.</P>
        <P>On a personal level, I know many gay couples and they have the same capacity for love and affection as do heterosexual couples.  While it may seem beside the point to mention such a matter, it would be remiss of me not to make this clear.  Moreover, I personally consider that it is unfortunate, five years after the formation of the Government, that there is nothing on the Statute Book to recognise such basic rights.  It would not be unreasonable for a person to infer that this constituted a judgment on gay and lesbian couples and that the failure to legislate implies their relationships are in some way inferior to those of heterosexual couples.  Perhaps it implies that somehow they cannot integrate fully into society.  It implies they cannot aspire fully to the human dignity afforded to heterosexual couples, which is highly unfortunate.</P>
        <P>This is not a debate on marriage.  The All-Party Committee on the Constitution discussed that element and the Minister&rsquo;s comment was correct, that is, its members agreed collectively that a referendum on the constitutional element would be defeated.  I wish to make a couple of remarks in respect of the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  I am a member of that committee and it spent a good deal of 2004 and 2005 considering the family provisions of the Constitution.  As I noted, its members decided not to proceed because they considered that a change on the issue of marriage would be defeated.  This is not to state its members did not think such marriage-based rights should be afforded to same-sex couples.  Instead, the committee recommended this type of legislation in 2005.  Two years have passed and other legislation has come before the House much more promptly.  I accept that we owe more to couples who deserve to have the basic rights to which I referred.</P>
        <P>The Minister suggested the Bill would not survive a constitutional challenge.  The All-Party Committee on the Constitution took specific legal advice on this point during its hearings and received no such advice.  There was no suggestion that legislation on the bundle of rights would be unconstitutional.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for putting that on the record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Members must also consider the Zappone judgment, to which the Minister referred as a reason to delay.  While this may be simplistic, there will always be court cases that touch on issues of the day or issues of major importance.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="145"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Members should bear in mind that if Dr. Gilligan and Dr. Zappone lose their case, legislation will be required.  However, if they win, it will be needed all the more.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the failure to consider cohabitees is of any relevance either.  If one takes the United Kingdom legislation as an example, it has no relevance to cohabitees.  One reason with which I agree is that cohabitees who wish to avail of the bundle of rights to which I referred may so do by way of marriage, whereas same-sex couples have no such option.</P>
        <P>I consider myself to be liberal and want to live in a society in which people are trusted to behave and act in their own best interest.  It is important that no message is sent from this Parliament that suggests to young men and women that there is either intolerance at worst, or indifference.  Too many young men and women in their teens who struggle to come to terms with homosexuality in a sometimes intolerant society see only one tragic way out of their dilemma.  Consequently, great caution must be exercised by all speakers on this issue to avoid a single breath of a word that might be interpreted as intolerance or indifference.</P>
        <P>I will make some international comparisons.  As Belgium, Sweden, Finland and others in the European Union have already granted these rights to same-sex unions, Ireland is a little behind in this respect.  The Dutch have gone even further on the issue of marriage.  Seven Canadian jurisdictions have recognised same sex unions, which has given rise to the Gilligan case.  In addition, one or two states in America have also done so.  I understand the New York state pension scheme has also indicated it will recognise such unions.</P>
        <P>These are all important developments and Members should recognise that the Government has passed significant legislation that puts down a marker of its intentions.  The Minister referred to them in last night&rsquo;s debate in which he was heckled unfairly.  He did not have an opportunity to put his case as fairly as he was entitled.  Although he had important things to say, he was barracked.  It diminishes a proper debate on an issue of such importance to individuals when it turns into a pantomime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>He was completely offside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Quinn should allow Deputy Andrews to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Quinn will not justify himself retrospectively by heckling even more.  He will accept the Minister had relevant things to say and that he was barracked unfairly.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by noting that the Taoiseach opened the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network <Col N="146"/>office in April 2006.  I hope that is an indicator of his absolute and total commitment to this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party is to be commended for introducing this Bill because it has brought the issue into sharp focus.  As Deputy Andrews stated, the Government is responsible for being a little tardy in dealing with this issue.  It puts it up to us as to whether we are prepared to legislate to grant equality to all citizens.</P>
        <P>I have difficulties with the motion before us this evening.  My instinct is to accord every citizen equality.  That equality is denied to people in same-sex unions in the face of the Constitution.  It made me reflect on whether the Constitution serves us well any more.  While it contains a reference to the protection and particular status of the family, I am of the mind that the Constitution does not serve us well.  It is meant to be a living document of our times.  However, it focuses on an era long since gone.</P>
        <P>Contributors said last night that we have a duty.  People&rsquo;s opinions on what is required and the circumstances of people&rsquo;s lives are not always accommodated within legislation.  I have no doubt our duty as the current incumbents in this House is to provide legislation to grant equality to people in same-sex unions.  As a result, I have difficulties which I expressed to the Minister yesterday.  One wants to be generous and do what is right for people denied the capacity within our legal framework to be treated equally.  In this sense, the Labour Party&rsquo;s Bill provides an opportunity to deal with this obvious inequality in our Constitution and the laws as they stand.  I was minded to support it.</P>
        <P>As we opened the debate, the Ceann Comhairle addressed the issue of whether the Bill is being killed and it is a moot point.  I would find it more comfortable if the Government brought forward legislation which dealt with this issue.  When I spoke to the Minister last night, he made the point that the Bill is not broad enough in terms of all that needs to be accommodated.  Deputy Andrews also referred to this aspect.  I accept the argument that a little bit is better than no progress at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Three quarters of a loaf is a big meal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot deny I have difficulties with it.  However, in another sense, if we are to consider this legislation we must do so in an extremely comprehensive way.  Work is under way in the Department and I do not accept the Minister has done nothing.  He has done a lot as has the Taoiseach in &mdash; I do not want to use the word but &mdash; embracing the gay and lesbian communities.  They made an important statement on the centrality of people of a particular sexual orientation whose needs are not met by current legislation.</P><Col N="147"/>
        <P>This situation must be properly and comprehensively addressed.  This is why I was, and am, prepared to accept the Minister&rsquo;s intention to bring forward complex legislation.  Deputy Andrews mentioned the extent and capacity of the UK Act.  Many people may not appreciate it but if we are to serve people well, we must address this in an extremely comprehensive manner.</P>
        <P>The comforting thought is that no matter what the result is of the election, the issue of the status of same-sex unions will be addressed.  The commitment is there on an all-party basis.  I do not underestimate the disappointment and I share some of Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s attitude about the lack of cowardice on the part of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no lack of cowardice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in abundance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>My attitude when sitting here last night listening to the debate was to question why we have not brought forward such legislation already.  As the Minister pointed out, complications exist.  When one is in Government and receives advice from the Attorney General, it must be heeded.  It is correct to provide for comprehensive legislation in this area.  Raising this matter on Private Members&rsquo; business and bringing forward this Bill copperfastens and commits every political party as we go into a general election to legislate in this area.  It is important we do so if we are to view ourselves as a pluralist republic.  It is the duty of our times to provide for equality on this matter.  It is incumbent on us all, particularly the Minister, to bring forward comprehensive legislation as speedily as he can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate.  It is traditional on these occasions to compliment the mover of the Bill and I do so sincerely.  If Deputy Howlin does not mind, I will compliment him on his efforts in this regard.</P>
        <P>I often made the point that it is always good to see people in the Visitors Gallery and I am pleased so many are here tonight.  It is a pity the Polish gentleman who visited the Ceann Comhairle on Monday was not here last night and is not here tonight but chose Dublin Castle as the venue to make the statements he made yesterday.  It would be good if he heard the debate last night and tonight.  I hope what happened yesterday will be corrected.</P>
        <P>It is right that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann gets an opportunity to discuss equality for same-sex couples.  I welcome this historic opportunity as a public representative and legislator who deals on a regular basis with the problems of my constituents who are prevented from marrying in this State.</P>
        <P>I support the Government amendment a little reluctantly because same-sex couples have an <Col N="148"/>urgent need and right to have their relationships placed on a sound legal footing.  However, the manner proposed by the Labour Party is not the best way to tackle it.  I trust the track record of the Government in moving towards a more equal society for all its citizens.  I hope colleagues on all sides of the House will consider the situation in this way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree that same-sex couples have waited too long for the legal recognition they are entitled to as citizens of this Republic.  However, I am reminded that Fianna F&aacute;il, and the then Minister for Justice, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, proposed the decriminalisation of homosexuality when in government with the Labour Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the important bit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, effectively moved the equality agenda forward by presenting to the House the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 which put Ireland to the forefront in protecting individuals, including gay people, from discrimination.</P>
        <P>We have delivered and will do so again.  It is because of this track record that I support the Government amendment, which I do on trust.  I trust, having read the statements made by the Government, that we will honour our commitment to bring forward good legislation to guarantee equality for same-sex couples at the earliest possible moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>In ten years perhaps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I have supported the track record of Fianna F&aacute;il in improving the status of gay people.  Gay and lesbian people are members of our families.  They are sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces.  They are our neighbours, constituents and friends.  It is not acceptable for them to be treated differently or unfairly.  The Government is committed to addressing their needs in a fair and positive<?oasys _jy ?>way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Just not tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a major caring crisis facing us.  People are having fewer children, while adults have less time for caring duties, both child care and elder care.  The Government responds positively to these challenges.  A society that encourages more committed family units is a better one.  Family units have moved beyond the traditional and reflect modern life.  This includes same-sex family units.</P>
        <P>We must overcome difficulties which same-sex couples meet in the recognition of their loving relationships.  They need to be treated equally in taxation, inheritance, welfare, pension and next of kin matters.  There are controversial matters <Col N="149"/>which need to be debated such as adoption.  I am not afraid of that debate because we should always remember that children need good parents.  Good parents are not ordained by their sexual orientation but are adults who love, care, educate and provide for their children.  We should never close off the opportunity of providing that environment for any of our children.  Same-sex couples can provide that environment, despite the reluctance of some parties in the House to acknowledge this.  I hope this issue is taken on urgently by the Government which should bear the welfare of children of same-sex partnerships in mind in any legislation it proposes.  If the natural child of a person in a same-sex partnership loses his or her parent through death, I cannot see the justice in requiring that he or she should also lose the right to be cared for by his or her parent&rsquo;s partner who has also reared him or her.  I cannot see how we as legislators would want any child to lose the two people who have loved and raised him or her.  Registered same-sex partners should have the right to adopt the natural child of one of the partners, if this is in the best interests of the child.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy want to vote on that issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Children have been educated in same sex institutions throughout the history of the State.  Many single parents raise their children in loving homes and we should not shy away from providing the children of gay parents the security of stable and loving family relationships.  It is for that reason and the reason the Government has proposed the first ever children&rsquo;s rights amendment to the Constitution that we need time to make sure we get this right for the children concerned and the adults who love and care for them.  I have heard the view that the Bill does not give us that time.</P>
        <P>We have heard Opposition criticism of the Government amendment.  I agree the time has come to provide same-sex couples with a proper legal structure and status for their relationships.  The many issues facing other cohabiting couples can also be addressed at the same time or separately, but there are differences.  Opposite sex cohabiting couples can get married if they are free to do so but same sex couples cannot.  This issue needs to be addressed urgently.  All cohabiting couples are not the same and same-sex couples are the most disadvantaged, a matter I want to see corrected.  It is not right to equate non-sexual relationships such as those between cohabiting family members with loving same-sex relationships.</P>
        <P>The time is right to act on this important human rights issue.  However, it must be done properly and not rushed just because of a general election.  I hope that in supporting the amendment it will be seen as my signal that I am looking to my party to commit to bringing to the House <Col N="150"/>comprehensive legislation which will properly address many of the issues raised in this debate and more.  We have fulfilled these promises in the past.  We have promised to do so again now and we will deliver.</P>
        <P>There is urgency attached to this matter.  That is why the Government has done much work already.  As a representative of a diverse constituency, I would like to be able to assure my constituents that this is a priority for Fianna F&aacute;il in government and one on which we will deliver in a proper way as soon as we can.</P>

	<P>We have received good advice and consulted widely on the issue.  We are serious about it.</P>
        <P>The amendment allows us to build on the work of various committees and implement their recommendations in the best interests of same-sex couples.  In the interests of equality, to which this party has always been committed, we should use the opportunity the amendment and debate give us to commit to bringing forward good legislation.  Fianna F&aacute;il can be trusted on this important matter.  All the major breakthroughs for gay people have been pioneered by my party.</P>

        <P>I am impressed by the consultations and preparations undertaken by the Government during this D&aacute;il.  We will get it right for same-sex couples and soon.  The issue should not be rushed at the last minute before a general election.

	<P>I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to this new legislation, the Civil <Col N="151"/>Unions Bill.  I support this progressive legislation and, unlike the T&aacute;naiste, I am standing by the Republic.  We must build and develop a republic based on equality and respect for human rights.  Those who have the privilege of being elected to the House must show respect to all citizens.  It is not just about accommodating difference, but enjoying and celebrating diversity.  That is the future of this country and this island.  </P>
        <P>I thank all the gay and lesbian people who have contacted my office in the past week on the Bill.  I will quote from one e-mail which sums up the legislation for me and many others.  It reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am with my partner for almost six years.  We both work, we pay our taxes, we socialise, we go on holidays, we are normal people living our lives together.  To our family and friends we are like any other couple they know, only we are not!  Because my partner happens to be the same gender as me we are not represented by the Government like every other couple.  By supporting the Civil Unions Bill you will be giving all members of Irish society similar rights.  If the Civil Unions Bill is passed my partner and I intend to have our relationship recognised and celebrated and in doing so will be able to secure legal protection for our future, something that if you are gay you don&rsquo;t have the right to!</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I thank you for taking the time to read my e-mail and again hope that you will support the Civil Unions Bill tonight in the D&aacute;il.

I see the Bill as positive, clear-cut and practical and its enactment would make a significant difference in areas such as parental rights, property rights and even the right to visit a sick partner in hospital.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s passage to Committee Stage depends on the attitude of Government.  Last night, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform minced no words when he rubbished the Bill as being poorly drafted and an exercise in grandstanding.  Ironically, he knows better than most how easy it is to remedy such flaws, having had <Col N="152"/>no difficulty last year in introducing a Garda Bill of skeletal proportions, tabling hundreds of amendments in a matter of days and imposing a guillotine to prevent a discussion on the amendments.  If he was truly the Minister for equality, he would be actively looking for a way to allow this Bill to commence Committee Stage, but it seems that the Minister is only enthusiastic about introducing laws that restrict rights and row back on civil liberties.  He is far from radical and is all but redundant as a Minister for equality.</P>

	<P>This Bill is concerned with giving legal recognition and equality to a legally invisible, but sizeable portion of our society.  It is clear-cut, progressive and long overdue.  Increasingly, we are seeing heterosexual couples opting for informal rather than legal relationships and when these relationships fail, the difficulties become apparent with everything from the rights of fathers in non-marital situations to property rights and tax reliefs cropping up just as they do for same-sex couples.</P>
        <P>We must find a way to support stable, committed and loving relationships and we must vote in favour of the Bill to ensure that all persons are afforded their right to equality before the law.</P>

	<P>In the two minutes available to me, I wish to put on record my unequivocal support for the Civil Unions Bill, as it is a matter of civil and human rights.  The Bill is a simple measure that, if accepted, would advance equality by providing for the recognition and legal registration of civil unions.</P>
        <P>It is the first time such a Bill has been debated in the D&aacute;il, but it follows on the initiative of that great and courageous campaigner, Senator Norris, who introduced his own Bill in the Seanad to advance the issue.  This Bill provides that parties to a civil union are responsible for supporting each other to the same extent and in the same way as is provided by law for married persons.  Put simply, the Bill would apply the detail of existing family law to civil union relationships.</P>
        <P>The Bill is concerned with respect for individual choice, which is surely the essence of equality.  The vast majority of citizens would be ready to support this measure, but, regrettably, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government does not have the courage to allow it to progress.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm teacht isteach anseo.  San am gairid at&aacute; agam, tabharfaidh m&eacute; taca&iacute;ocht don Bhille agus don bhfeachtas seo.  I strongly support the proposal before the D&aacute;il and the campaign for the ratification of civil unions as a recognised institution.</P>
        <P>Judging by the letters, e-mails and telephone calls received by Deputies in recent days from gay and lesbian people when news emerged that this Bill was being tabled, there is no question of whether there is a sizable demand for it.  Gay and lesbian people have needed to fight every inch of the way for the democratic rights they have won, such as they are.  They must now fight again.  Due to a demand from the community, I am supporting the Bill.  When implemented in the not-too-distant future, I hope it will open a new era for gay, lesbian and bisexual people in our society, which can well be the case.</P>
        <P>I want to refer to what Mr. Lech Kaczynski, the President of Poland, stated at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the National Forum on Europe when I challenged him about his suppression of the democratic rights of gay people in Warsaw when he was mayor of that city a number of years ago.  I asked whether he had changed his view on the rights of gay people to express themselves freely through parading democratically in their society.  His attitude and response, which comprised disgraceful comments, was a measure of how far we in Europe must go.  In one sense, the comments can be put aside as the ravings of a right wing reactionary, but of more concern is that suggestions such as his could be taken seriously by other elements in society who would then inflict their bigotry in a physical and violent manner on gay people in this State, Poland or elsewhere.  We must combat that strongly.</P>
        <P>The entire community, Irish people and their representatives in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann should criticise and condemn unremittingly the attitude of the Polish Government, which harks back to the Ireland of the 1930s, 1940s or 1950s.  In contrast to that, we look to a society where human beings, irrespective of their sexual orientation, views or gender, are allowed to live in an era of freedom, democracy and self-expression according to their feelings.</P>

	<P>On a cold December day 50 years ago, Rosa Louise Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man.  She was arrested and put on trial for that act of civil disobedience.  She stood up for equality and human and civil rights.  I wish the Government had the same courage to support the Labour Party Bill.</P>
        <P>The Green Party commends the Labour Party for introducing the Civil Unions Bill to the D&aacute;il.  As Deputy Howlin stated last night, this is a seminal equality issue.  The Green Party is strongly committed to providing full equality for all gay and lesbian citizens of the State.  It is very telling to an Opposition party such as ours that the Government has dithered on this matter for well over a year.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has had the options paper from the working group on domestic partnerships, as well as the Law Reform Commission report to inform him.  Still he has no indication on what he will do in the matter.  Last night he claimed the Government was unequivocally in favour of treating gay and lesbian people as full equal citizens in our society.  These are hollow words indeed from the other side of the House.</P>
        <P>Added to the criticisms in last night&rsquo;s debate were the comments yesterday of Polish President Lech Kaczynski about the gay community at the National Forum on Europe.  His homophobic pronouncement that gay culture posed a threat to the survival of the human race was nothing short of disgraceful.  In fact, he is a threat to the survival of human rights on the Continent.</P>
        <P>Last autumn the Green party launched its policy, Value in Families &mdash; a Policy on Marriage and Partnership Rights, which places enormous value on the vital role marriage plays in our society, but it also recognises that many aspects of this institution have changed since the Constitution was adopted in 1937.  It is vitally important to update legislation to provide for the contemporary times in which we live.  Same-sex couples should have the opportunity to avail of the rights and responsibilities of marriage, not just civil unions.  We would go further and give the right to marry to all same-sex couples.</P>
        <P>Marriage is a human right and is recognised as such by many treaties, as well as by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and so many other international agreements.  Same-sex couples are permitted to marry in Holland, Belgium, Spain and Canada, in the state of Massachusetts and the Republic of South Africa.  To relegate same-sex couples to some marriage-like institution is to deny them their human rights, dignity and rights as citizens of the State.  We would like to introduce legislation that would go further and permit the removal of all gender specific terms from current legislation and regulations governing the granting of marriages.  This would allow same sex couples to enjoy the equivalent rights and responsibilities of marriage <Col N="155"/>afforded to heterosexual couples, should they so choose.</P>
        <P>We have a Constitution that is stuck in the sleepy backwaters of the 1940s.  We have a Constitution that does not recognise families other than those based on marriage.  We have legislation that does not recognise same-sex relationships.  Tax laws and inheritance rights are blind to the reality of modern Ireland.  They are blind to the fact that one third of the children born in Ireland today are born outside marriage.  It is time to drag the Constitution and legislation kicking and screaming into the 21st century.  It is clearly a matter of human and civil rights and equality.  Just like Sr. Rosa Parks 50 years ago, this Legislature needs to take a brave step forward.  For that reason the Green Party supports the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposals.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Tugaim f&aacute;ilte roimh an deis chun labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo, agus taca&iacute;onn Sinn F&eacute;in go hioml&aacute;n leis an mBille.  Feicimid n&iacute;os faide, &aacute;fach, ach glacaimid leis agus taca&iacute;mid go hioml&aacute;n le cearta a bheith ag c&uacute;pla den ghn&eacute;as c&eacute;anna p&oacute;sadh agus clann a bhunadh.  Ar nd&oacute;igh taca&iacute;mid chomh maith le cearta si&uacute;d nach bhfuil p&oacute;sta, n&oacute; c&uacute;pla nach bhfuil den ghn&eacute;as c&eacute;anna a bheith p&aacute;irteach le ch&eacute;ile mar at&aacute; leagtha amach ins an mBille seo.</P>
        <P>I recall when were discussing the Civil Registration Bill in 2003 that Sinn F&eacute;in tried to provide for equal recognition of same-sex marriage.  In our amendment we did not get the support of the Government or some of the Opposition parties, regretfully.  However, we continued and tried again in the Equality Bill in 2004 to allow for a more inclusive definition of the term &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; to recognise same-sex partnerships.  Again, the initiative was shot down by the Government.  We made a submission to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution calling for the definition of the family to be extended to include same-sex couples.  Once again we did not get the support of the Government parties.</P>
        <P>When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and other Government members lecture the Labour Party and those who are supporting the Bill about how great they are and how far they have gone, I need only remind them of those examples.  That has been the experience of my party.  Other parties have been represented in the House a good deal longer and put in much more work on this issue than we have managed to do.  I call on the Government to withdraw its amendment, even at this late stage, and allow the Bill to pass on Second Stage.  There is an urgent necessity for rights to be included for civil partnerships such as inheritance, adoption, visitation and residency.  Therefore, we support their implementation, even though it is our belief that it does not amount to full equality.</P><Col N="156"/>
        <P>We recognise, too, that some couples, both heterosexual and same sex, do not wish to marry and only want civil partnership status.  Therefore, we are supporting the Bill.  However, ultimately, full equality for gay men and lesbians will only be achieved by allowing those who wish to marry to do so.  The Government&rsquo;s delaying tactics are a disgrace and we will oppose its obstruction of the Bill at the end of this Second Stage debate.  I remind it that it has obligations to introduce equality protections for these communities under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement&rsquo;s equivalence provisions.  Britain&rsquo;s Gender Recognition Act 2004 and Civil Partnership Act 2004 mean that lesbian and gay couples in the Six Counties now have broadly equivalent rights to those enjoyed by married couples.  Both the Equality Authority and the NESF have called for the State to level up its equality legislation by introducing similar provisions.  The report, endorsed by the Equality Authority in the State and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, entitled Equivalence in Promoting Equality, launched in December 2005, states that the reforms:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">. . .need not precisely replicate UK legislation.  However, legislation is required to protect and give effect to equal treatment of transsexual people and lesbian and gay couples under the equivalence requirement [of the Good Friday Agreement].</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is an obligation to which the Government has not lived up.  Many times the Minister has lectured republicans on our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  It is time he lived up to his obligations and those of the Government on this issue and in the light of the Good Friday Agreement.  I hope, even at this late stage, the Government will get sense and withdraw its amendment.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies McManus, Quinn and Michael D. Higgins. </P>
        <P>I am proud, as a member of the Labour Party, to speak in support of the Bill on civil unions and join in congratulating my colleague, Deputy Howlin, for his work on it and for its introduction.  This is an issue of human rights and equality.  It is about freedom for gay and lesbian people to enjoy the same rights, as couples, enjoyed by heterosexuals.  I am certain that some day the D&aacute;il will legislate to give full legal status to same-sex unions, but why cannot it be today?  Why are we waiting?  Why does the Government insist on deferring this important legislation for six months?</P>
        <P>I was saddened by the contribution last night of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy McDowell.  I was saddened because he proposed one of the most dishonest amendments I have ever seen in the House which pretended to be sympathetic to gay and lesbian people but <Col N="157"/>which in reality was scuppering the legislation because the six month delay he proposes will cause the Bill to fall with the dissolution of the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I was also saddened that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, in his contribution last night volunteered his party for further redundancy which he has so often wished to avoid.  I remember in 1993 when the Progressive Democrats from the Opposition benches supported the then Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, when she introduced legislation to decriminalise homosexuality while she was being stabbed in the back in her own back yard by some of her party colleagues.</P>
        <P>Last night the Minister, Deputy McDowell, declared:</P>
        <P LI="1">From the dark days of prejudice, a new tolerance has emerged, based on our appreciation of the fact that homosexual people are in every respect entitled to be equally valued as members of society and not to be relegated to an inferior status.  That is what republicanism is all about.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In these two eloquent sentences the Minister makes the case for the Labour Party Bill but what will he and his party do about it in this Chamber in under an hour&rsquo;s time?  What is the republicanism of which he speaks?  Will they stand by the Republic and vote for this Bill or will they stand behind their Government partners, for some of whom at least republicanism is now merely a subtitle, and sink the hopes of many same-sex couples throughout the country?</P>
        <P>I ask in particular my colleague, Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley, with whom I share a constituency, where she will stand.  Will she stand with the people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire who sent her, Deputy Andrews and me here, who share our liberal outlook and who value the concepts of personal freedoms that we came here to represent?  Will she support this Bill proposed by the Labour Party or will she support the pathetic amendment to its Second Stage, the politics of which are given away in one clause of it which states &ldquo;Mindful of the desirability of legislating in this area in such a manner as to attract the greatest degree of social consensus&rdquo;?</P>
        <P>There was all the guff in the Minister, Deputy McDowell&rsquo;s speech yesterday about the Constitution, and I thank Deputy Andrews for recording that it was guff and that there is no constitutional impediment to this Bill.  All the talk from the Minister, Deputy McDowell, yesterday about the desirability of legislating for civil unions may be Progressive Democrats window-dressing but the so-called desirability of social consensus is pure undiluted Fianna F&aacute;il.  What it means is that we are approaching a general election, this is a tricky social issue and Fianna F&aacute;il wants to be able to face both ways at the same time.  It wants to be able to tell those who support civil unions that they did not really oppose this Bill and vote against it &mdash; they only postponed it <Col N="158"/>for six months.  At the same time, they want to be able to tell those who opposed legislating for civil unions that they did not support the Labour Party Bill.</P>
        <P>I have come to expect nothing more than that from Fianna F&aacute;il and I feel sorry for my constituency colleague, Deputy Andrews, who is nobbled to support that position.  However, this is a defining moment for the Progressive Democrats because they are a separate party and they can tell their partners in Government that they are not having it in the same way as they told them on a number of economic issues during the past ten years that they were not having it.  If they stand for the liberal values they have professed here so often, if they stand for the concept of personal freedom, which I thought I shared with them, and if they stand, as they have said here previously, by the Republic, they will come into this House and vote with the Labour Party on this Bill tonight.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Shortly after I was elected to this House, the then Minister for Justice, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, introduced a Bill decriminalising homosexuality.  I remember at the time being enormously impressed by her practical outlook and also by her bravery.  She was one of the very few women in this House.  She stepped outside the traditional mindset of her party to do something important for many of our people and also for our society.  It was refreshing to see.  It is dispiriting to listen to the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has stepped back into that murkiness of a traditional mindset.  People are quite shocked and dismayed to find that he cannot do even the simple things that would be required of him in this day and age.  </P>
        <P>I congratulate Deputy Howlin on introducing this Bill.  I, like other Deputies, am proud to be a member of the Labour Party tonight, but regrettably this Bill should be a matter of pride for all parties in this House.  Everybody should be celebrating the passing of this Bill to ensure that people attain rights to which they are entitled.  It is unbelievable that something so simple, obvious and important is being blocked in a way that is demeaning to people outside this House and people in the Gallery who are waiting to see what will happen to this Bill.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide same-sex couples with the same basic rights and duties that are available to married couples.  In our society we celebrate marriage.  We celebrate the idea of a stable, loving relationship that a couple set out to have in married union.  Why can we not celebrate a stable, loving relationship engaged in by a same-sex couple?  Is that not valid and important &mdash; two people looking after each other, two people ensuring that there is love in that relationship and that there is official recognition for that love?  I know of a case where a person ended up in a psychiatric hospital and the per<Col N="159"/>son&rsquo;s long-standing partner was not treated as a married person would have been treated.  The partner was excluded from providing the normal support a couple expect from each other.  This also applies where a partner of a same-sex couple is dying in hospital; God knows there is enough indignity without heaping it on.</P>
        <P>The approach in the Bill is practical and compassionate but it is also rigorous in terms of respect.  Single sex couples have an entitlement to respect.  When I heard the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, speak last night it struck me forcefully that a pygmy is in charge of the Progressive Democrats.  If the previous leader of the Progressive Democrats was still in her old position, I do not believe she would have let this go.  Others have asked the party to stand up and stand by the Republic.  I do not believe they have any conviction left in terms of their belief of what the Republic stands for and what republican values are all about.  I regret that because this could have been a fine moment.</P>
        <P>It could have been a good moment in Irish political history, as was the moment when the then Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, came into this House and introduced the legislation to which I referred.  She had to do that in much more difficult circumstances but she did it, and I paid tribute her for doing it at the time.  We now have a Bill presented by Deputy Howlin which is robust and stands up to the tests that legal minds have applied to it.  All that is failing is the political leadership that is so lacking among people who do not have the will or the commitment to support what this Republic stands for.  I regret that greatly.</P>

We had negotiated in the programme for Government &mdash; and I am proud to sit beside a colleague who helped me to do it &mdash; that it would be an essential condition of Labour&rsquo;s participation in government that this would not become an aspiration but would become law.</P><Col N="160"/>
        <P>I detect a mood right across this country, from Ballinasloe to Ballybrack, from Cahirciveen to Cavan and from Donegal to Dundalk.  There is a cry arising from a large section of our people which is quite simple &mdash; we want to be free.  We want to be free to exercise the same rights as citizens that our brothers, sisters, cousins and mothers and fathers have exercised without any constraint or restraint.  This is about freedom &mdash; freedom to be equal, freedom not only to step out of the closet, a right they got ten years ago, but to step into the sunshine of liberation which this Bill could give to them.  Yet the Progressive Democrats &mdash; God love them &mdash; say &ldquo;Yes, but not today&rdquo;.  What the hell are they doing?  What is the relevance of the Progressive Democrats Party if it cannot do this?  What does it matter if the Bill gets through Second Stage?  We all know it is a declaration of liberation.  There are 18 sitting days left, so we cannot get through the detail between now and Easter and we will be on the hustings after that.</P>
        <P>What will Progressive Democrat representatives say to the people of Ballybrack or Booterstown or Blackrock?  Will they say they are in favour of liberty, but not today?  What will my constituency colleague do?  This is the man who guaranteed that he would be either radical or redundant.  He had better start looking for his P45.</P>
        <P>This is a good Bill.  It is a clever Bill.  I am proud to be a member of a party that has in its membership probably the best parliamentary draftsman available to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have worked with him before and my friend and colleague Deputy Brendan Howlin has worked very cleverly to push the limit of liberation up to the very limits of the Constitution as it exists.  We are veterans of the struggle for the liberalisation of this Republic.  Let it not be forgotten that we lost the first referendum on divorce.  Let it be remembered that less than 0.5% of the vote carried the constitutional amendment in 1996.  However, the most recent opinion poll stated that 75% of the population had no problem with the legalisation of divorce.  Family life has not collapsed.  Children are still loved and told stories while being put to bed.  If we enact the Civil Unions Bill 2006 &mdash; we cannot do it now but a Labour Government will certainly do it &mdash; then we will create the aura of confidence that will enable us to put into the Constitution the very rights we want to give effect with this Bill.</P>
        <P>I implore Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley and my colleague in the Dublin South-East constituency to stand up for the rights they guaranteed to give people and for vote for this Bill on Second Stage.  I implore her to do what her father did and stand by the Republic.</P>

	<P>I join others in paying tribute to my colleague, Deputy Howlin, for introducing this Bill.  In the short time available to me, I wish to make a few points that are fundamental.</P><Col N="161"/>
        <P>This is a fundamental equality issue.  Having sat through the debate last night, I am appalled at some suggestions that we can evolve easily and comfortably towards an adjustment on this issue.  That is an appalling distortion of history.  Everything that has been gained for gay and lesbian couples and others has been gained through suffering and through struggle.  For example, it took five years for our Oireachtas to address the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the Norris case.  I am glad that Senator Norris is here listening to our debate.  It took 17 years from the time he initiated his case to achieve the adjustment of it in law in the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>What are those people who will vote against this Bill tonight actually saying?  They are saying something fundamentally dishonest but also something very deep.  They are saying to gay and lesbian people that they can wait again.  I think of all those people who were driven out of this country because of their sexual orientation.  I look forward to the day, not when we will have a cavalcade following a bigoted Polish President through the streets of Dublin, but when couples will be able to walk hand in hand, unmolested and enjoying the full freedom of participation in society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Equality is the equality to participate fully and not to adjust oneself over generations to concessions made by people who have not the courage to realise that a great wrong is being perpetrated.  The time has come to let the light shine on the full yard that is human rights.  This is a human right.  People are being asked this evening to accept the principle or to reject it.  If they accept it, which is what Second Stage legislation is all about, then let them enhance it and bring in legislation for parallel areas on Committee Stage.  If they vote tonight against Second Stage, they are voting against the principles that all of us have been enunciating.</P>
        <P>Dishonest arguments are being made.  Last night, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made reference to the Zappone-Gilligan case.  He was asked to speak about the acceptance of what marriage is now, not what it should be or may be.  It is an insult to you, Sir, and to me and to all of the others in the House to suggest that the Oireachtas, as the legislative arm, must wait until a Supreme Court decision is given.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Oireachtas is a separate arm, but in any case Article 26 of the Constitution gives a further right to the President if we pass something about which there is constitutional doubt to send it to the Supreme Court.  The Minister was advocating something cowardly and something quite incremental.  The choice in Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s Bill is not a false choice <Col N="162"/>between incrementalism that is deceitful or a confrontation with the Constitution on the definition of marriage.  It is about civil union.  If we have civil union in place, then we move on to all of the other areas.</P>
        <P>I welcome every advance that is made of an incremental kind, but I also note the reverses.  Regarding free fuel, for example, if one is not a spouse one can be left cold.  The cold times should be over in Ireland and we should not evolve towards anything.  We should be leaping into a new era of rights where this is the first fundamental step.</P>

	<P>I reiterate the Government&rsquo;s approach to enhancing the rights of same-sex couples and cohabitants in general.  The Government wants to deliver a framework in which non-married couples, including gay couples, can live in a supportive and a secure legal environment.  The Labour Party&rsquo;s Civil Unions Bill 2006 only partly addresses this issue.  However, I pay tribute to the Labour Party, especially Deputy Howlin, for bringing forward this Bill tonight.  I suspect that many people do not fully appreciate or understand the difficulties that same-sex couples experience in their daily lives.  The T&aacute;naiste said last night that it would not be appropriate to address such problems, which are being exacerbated by the current legal uncertainty, in a piecemeal fashion.  He argued that it was inadequate to attempt to provide a direct equivalent to marriage for same-sex couples without taking into account the wide range of cohabitation and family models which deserved the protection of the law.  The terms of the Bill, as presented, appear to be inconsistent with the terms of the Constitution.</P>

	<P>He was asked the wrong question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be prudent to await the Supreme Court&rsquo;s determination on an appeal pending in a case relating to the recognition by the State of a same-sex marriage contracted in a foreign jurisdiction.  This legislation is premature in view of the appeal to the Supreme Court.  Section 5 of the Bill which provides for legal recognition in the State of foreign same-sex marriages and civil partnerships pre-empts the ruling of the Supreme Court in this case.  The Government is committed to providing greater rights and recognition and higher levels of protection for unmarried cohabiting couples.  In particular, it recognises the justified claims of the gay and lesbian community to recognition and protection for their relationships.  The limited legal protections available to gay and lesbian couples in discrete areas of the law were put in place by the Government.  Deputy McManus mentioned the former Minister for Justice, Mrs. M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, who introduced legislation in the House not that long ago to decriminalise homosexuality.  If my memory serves me correctly, a big queue did not form in the House to support the measure she was introducing.</P>

Given that Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred to the comments made yesterday by the President of Poland, it would not be correct if I did not comment on them.  It was not fitting, in the modern world in which we live, for a president to make such disgraceful remarks</P>

	<P>While the view of those of us on this side of the House is that the Second Reading of this Bill should be postponed for six months, we are very supportive of the spirit of the Bill.  The T&aacute;naiste suggested during Private Members&rsquo; Business last night that such a postponement would allow a more comprehensive approach to the question of civil partnerships to be adopted.  Those who doubt the commitment of this side of the House in that regard will not have to wait very long until they see how serious we are about what we are saying.  The Government intends to build on a number of recent developments, including the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report of December 2006 and the options paper on domestic partnerships, published in November of that year.  I compliment the Labour Party on tabling the Bill before the House.  We have waited far too long to give these issues the priority they deserve.  While I am not in a position to vote in favour of the legislation on this occasion, I support the spirit of what is being proposed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join my colleagues in thanking Deputy Howlin for authoring the Civil Unions Bill 2006 and bringing it to the House tonight.  This is a moment of some historic importance, as legislation of this nature has never before been presented in this Chamber.  I thank my colleagues who have contributed for the passion and conviction they have displayed in addressing the central precepts of the legislation.  I thank the other Deputies on the Opposition side of the House who have given the legislation their support, which I acknowledge.</P>
        <P>I was at a meeting in my office when this evening&rsquo;s debate started.  Some of the participants in the meeting mistook the background noises we could hear for support for the legislation on the part of the Government Deputies addressing the House.  I could hear the Deputies making supportive noises, but when I turned up the sound to hear the debate more clearly I listened to Deputies Andrews and Fiona O&rsquo;Malley squirming and wriggling as they explained that the Bill did not go far enough for them to support it.  Deputy O&rsquo;Malley said &ldquo;the Bill is not broad enough&rdquo; to earn her support.  My constituency colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Connor, started his contribution by thanking Deputy Howlin for producing the Bill, the people in the Visitors Gallery for <Col N="165"/>attending the debate, the Ceann Comhairle for togging out and the stenographers for doing their job.  He was just short of thanking the parish priest for the use of the Chamber.  He then tried to get to grips with a script, to which he was clearly a stranger, which stated he was against the legislation.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy S&eacute;an Power, whose remarks I take as being absolutely genuinely intended.  I accept that the Bill may cause discomfort to some Members of the House.  I acknowledge that their feelings constitute a fair reflection of how certain segments of our population continue to feel.  I cannot give any such benefit of the doubt to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, however.  Members of the House are accustomed to Ministers&rsquo; knee-jerk opposition to our legislative proposals.  The Minister, Deputy McDowell, prides himself on his reputation as an intellectual with a fine legal brain and a deep familiarity with the Constitution.  His descent last night into the depths of shallow humbug, bluster and guff was an embarrassment to his party, its founders and some of its current members, as well as most of his colleagues in the Law Library and all of us who take our politics seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s performance last night was a shameful, shallow, rowdy, incoherent, arrogant and bombastic farce.  As we have to accept he is not a stupid man, we can only be driven to the conclusion &mdash; if parliamentary decorum permits us to arrive at the logical conclusion &mdash; that his performance last night was deliberately deceitful and calculated to mislead the House, the visitors in the Visitors Gallery with a special interest in the issue and the wider general public.  He masked his refusal to accept the Bill, even in terms of its broad general principles, by reference to the Constitution and the law.  On nearly every point he made, he was entirely wrong.  I repeat that I do not believe his inaccuracies were due to ignorance.  There is something more malevolent at work.  There is a patronising attempt at empathy and mock concern.  At the heart of it, there is a refusal to address this issue and that refusal is based on reasons which are manufactured for the purpose and have no basis in reality.</P>
        <P>The Minister made three specific points to which there are three specific and complete rebuttals.  First, he claimed that the Bill attempted to pre-empt the Supreme Court decision in the appeal in the Zappone case, to which my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, has made reference.  For those who do not know, that case is about whether the Constitution and the law, as they stand, require the recognition in the State of a same-sex marriage celebrated a few years ago in Canada.  The Minister states: &ldquo;If the Supreme Court is to uphold the High Court and rule that <Col N="166"/>it would be unconstitutional to recognise foreign marriages in this way, section 5 of this Bill would fall flat on its face.&rdquo;  However, the High Court did not rule that it would be unconstitutional to give any form of recognition or status in our law to foreign same-sex marriages.  There was no argument in the Zappone case about whether the Constitution prohibited recognition of foreign same-sex marriages.  The only argument which was predictably lost was whether the Constitution already required such recognition before any law was passed on the issue.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party Bill is concerned with what the law would be after it was passed; it would have no impact whatsoever on the issues to be decided in the Zappone case.  Every first year law student knows this.  The Minister must know it also, but when he cannot win an argument on logic and the facts, he resorts to under-hand tactics.</P>
        <P>Second, the Minister criticises the Bill for what it does not do.  He says it does not address the position of cohabitants.  When it was pointed out to him that this was a separate issue, he replied:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is not a separate issue.  It is the same issue. It is the same issue, namely, there are people in our society who are not in a position to enter into a marriage, for one reason or another, but who want to have legal recognition for the attributes of mutual dependency which arise out of their relationship.</P>
        <P>He further stated: &ldquo;The Government wants to deliver a framework in which all non-married couples, including gay couples, can live in a supportive and a secure legal environment.&rdquo;  That statement betrays the Minister&rsquo;s complete unawareness of the issues involved.  Cohabitation relationships between heterosexual couples involve people who could marry but choose not to do so.  What is at issue is the status of people who want to do more than cohabit but who are prevented from marrying.  If the Minister cannot yet see and appreciate that point, he has been talking and listening to no one.  His approach is to bundle together same-sex couples who are not married because they cannot marry with those couples for whom cohabitation is a matter of lifestyle choice.  His approach is ignorant, patronising and blinkered.  That he fully understands the point I am making but is seeking to obscure and confuse it is best exemplified by a passage from a speech he delivered at the conference on the legal status of cohabitants and same-sex couples held on 26 May 2006:</P>
        <P LI="1">Heterosexual couples have the option of marriage open to them.  If we are to offer them something with all the rights and entitlements of a valid marriage, it should also have the same duties attaching to it.  Indeed the rights of one partner are often the duties of the other.  In effect it is marriage, albeit by another name.  It is doubtful whether there are any advantages <Col N="167"/>to providing in the law for an institution for opposite sex couples which mirrors marriage.</P>
        <P LI="1">The situation, of course, is different for same-sex couples for whom marriage is prohibited.  I want to take this opportunity to put it on the public record that the Government are unequivocally in favour of treating gay people as full, equal citizens in our society.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is from the man&rsquo;s own mouth.  However, that was then when generalised blandishments would suffice but this is now when a decision directly confronts him and his colleagues in government; hence the undignified retreat and the furious and noisy attempts to hide his back-tracking.</P>
        <P>Third, the Minister&rsquo;s amendment notes that the Bill &ldquo;appears&rdquo; to be unconstitutional.  It does not state why and the Minister in his speech did not provide much detail.  He did suggest that it might breach the State&rsquo;s obligation to guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is founded and to protect it against attack.  Presumably, he is not arguing that those of a homosexual orientation should reconcile themselves to the married state or that offering civil union for same-sex couples would lure heterosexuals away from marriage.  If he is not saying that, on what conceivable basis is he arguing that making specific provision for same-sex couples would have any effect whatsoever on an institution that is at present confined to opposite-sex couples?</P>
        <P>Absurdly, the Bill is mocked for being too short.  According to this big, swinging Minister, we are trying to achieve in ten sections something that required 264 sections in the United Kingdom.  The argument is absurd because it ignores the fact that precisely the same outcome was achieved in a Vermont statute with seven sections and a Canadian statute which had 15.  Last year the Minister himself introduced a Bill with just 38 sections but such is his unhealthy fascination with statute size that by the time he was finished with it he had added 159.</P>
        <P>The purpose of a Second Stage debate is to elucidate the general principles of a Bill.  The Bill before the House contains within it one single over-riding principle, the principle of equality.  The principle of equality is at once simple and unsettling, often unwelcomed, yet ultimately unquenchable and undeniable.  The principle of equality is founded on the bond of our common humanity.  It is based on our recognition in each other of an essential shared human experience.  Our shared humanity is far greater than any difference in how we look, how we pray, what our capabilities are, or how we choose a partner in life.  The Nobel laureate, Amartya Sen, has written that every ethical system put forward for the organisation of society contains within it a notion of equality.  It could not be otherwise.  To deny <Col N="168"/>equality is to look another in the eye and proclaim him or her to be a lesser person.  It is to deny the bond of our common humanity.</P>
        <P>The Civil Unions Bill 2007, introduced by Deputy Howlin, is about equality.  It would offer same-sex couples the greatest measure of equality possible under the Constitution.  It would afford same-sex couples access to a status relationship similar to marriage in every practical way.  It would provide thousands of our fellow citizens with a vital legal protection and bring to an end countless forms of discrimination that they encounter in their daily lives.  The Bill would give this Legislature the opportunity to fulfil its constitutional role which is to legislate.  Too often in the past, this body has dodged difficult decisions.  Too often we have left issues unaddressed or left the courts too pick up after our undone work.  Too often it has been left to courageous individuals such as Senator Norris to ask the courts for justice which ought to have been afforded them by this body.  Tonight we have an opportunity to do the work that the people sent us here to do.  The Government wants to postpone; it wants to put off; it wants to defer.  There is no requirement for delay.  There is nothing that the House can do in six months time that it cannot do in the next six weeks, or in whatever number of days remains to this D&aacute;il.  The Government has the opportunity to amend the Bill if it wants to.  There is plenty of time for constructive engagement on Committee Stage and ample time to pass all Stages before the House falls.</P>
        <P>Members should not smile and pretend they are deeply concerned about equality.  They should not believe photo-opportunities and expressions of concern are a substitute for how they vote on the Bill.  They should not pretend, as the Minister does, that the Bill is somehow flawed.  It is not.  They should vote for the Bill and afford it the priority it deserves.</P>
        <P>As Dr. Martin Luther King said on that famous day when he proclaimed his dream of equality, he had come to remind us of &ldquo;the fierce urgency of now.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilising drug of gradualism.&rdquo;  This is not a matter than can be lightly deferred.  It is a matter of justice and equality that affects the daily lives of thousands of people &mdash; people who live in committed relationships but are denied the simple rights that married couples take for granted.  To delay is not to compromise.  To delay is to add to, not subtract from, the inequality in society.  To delay is to look our fellow citizens in the eye and dismiss the common bond of humanity.  Tonight all those who say they support the Bill have the opportunity to walk into the voting lobby and support it in the name of equality.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Very important legislation is being brought before the House for discussion at 9.05 p.m.  There is only an hour to discuss it and we object to this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Presumably these are exceptional circumstances; otherwise we would not be asked by the Government to take this legislation tonight.  It is a cause of acute concern that the party spokespersons received no notice of it until this evening.  I have not seen the legislation and it does not take very much probing to realise its far-reaching implications.  We are not being allowed any time to tease it out or ask pertinent questions. <Col N="174"/> I am very uneasy about the time being allowed by the Government Whip.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>If it is essential that the legislation pass through both Houses tonight or before the opening of business tomorrow, a more adequate timeframe ought to be allowed in which to put questions to the Minister &mdash; there cannot be an adequate one given where we find ourselves.  It may well be that she can reassure this side of the House.  The legislation has implications for existing jobs, future entrants to the market and the entire medical insurance sector.  The time provided by the Government Whip does not allow for elucidation of any of these issues.</P>

If the legislation is so important, we should have suspended all other business, thus allowing a longer period in which to discuss it.  Rushed legislation such as this has a habit of biting back in the future.  I hope this Bill will not be such legislation and that the judgment to rush it through in this fashion will stand to us.</P>

The Government has decided that, in order to protect community rating, which keeps health insurance affordable for older and sick people, it is necessary to proceed as outlined.  I accept it is emergency legislation but governments have responsibility at times such as this to act appropriately.  I ask the House to wait for the Minister to explain the position in detail.</P>

	<P>I am starting to get worried that this Government has been in office for far too long.  When a Government is in power for too long, strange things begin to happen.  Journalists are arrested, Ministers assume extra powers and the Government starts finding out things before the public.  The causes of crime become eclipsed by a focus on the crimes themselves and judicial reform is eclipsed by attempts to curtail the right to silence.</P>
        <P>This morning a journalist, Mr. Michael McCaffrey, was arrested at his home in Dublin.  Journalists have a duty to report the facts without fear or favour, as Mr. McCaffrey&rsquo;s editor noted, and I believe that should be respected.  It is a dark day for press freedom when journalists are arrested for doing their job.  It is ironic that in a speech at the 2004 Edward O&rsquo;Donnell McDevitt Annual Symposium, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The media are a vital component of our democracy.  They are the means of democratic accountability.  Questioning media are not merely legitimate &mdash; they are essential.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is difficult to have a questioning media when journalists are being arrested.</P>
        <P>The Prisons Bill 2006, which is currently before the Houses, will make the Minister the planning Czar for all new places of detention, which is a dangerous assumption of powers.  During lunchtime today, he was apparently at the desk of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to get the news about the Ringsend incinerator in advance of everyone else, although given that he flip-flops so much, it is hard to know where he stands on the issue.  At least President Bush said, &ldquo;You may not agree with me, but you know where I stand&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is important that the judicial system focuses on the need to address the causes of crime.  In his 2004 speech, the Minister spoke about the rehabilitation of offenders.  He cited a survey which indicated that a significant number of prisoners have virtually no literacy skills and pointed out the need to address high rates of illiteracy and to provide work skills, training and education within the prison system.  However, not enough is being done in that regard.  In his most recent <Col N="176"/>report on Cloverhill Prison, the Inspector of Prisons found little work or other activities to engage prisoners while out of their cells and that they had no access to education.  Although classrooms had been provided, they were taken over by the prison transport corps.  He concluded that the present arrangement is deplorable.  I wish the Minister would have focused on the need for rehabilitation and reform instead the retrograde steps he has taken over the past four years by cutting back on educational and work programmes.</P>
        <P>In addressing the Bill before us, previous speakers have referred to the need to educate and inform the Judiciary.  Every time this issue arises, the Minister mentions the Judicial Studies Institute.  While I applaud that institute on the fine journal it publishes, it does not have the resources to prepare incoming members of the Judiciary for their jobs, let alone provide sufficient continuing professional development.  The two full-time staff employed at the institute represents a drop in the ocean when it comes to providing the detailed programmes required for modern judicial training and professional development.  Therefore, while I appreciate the need to speed up the judicial process, I remind the Minister of the need to go beyond the proposals made in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I draw Members attention to the provision in the Bill which allows the Government to assign judges to particular districts.  That provision concerns me because I am not sure whether the Government should have such a power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When making my contributions on similar Bills in 2003 and 2004, I recall asking why the Minister did not set a higher figure for the judges to be appointed.  I argued that if we had set a higher figure, we would not need to introduce further legislation when the court system had once again become bogged down, which is obviously the impetus for the Bill before us.  New judges could have been appointed to help ensure that the courts operate efficiently.  One of the reasons for granting bail applications is because judges have considered the length of time a defendant spends on remand as a result of backlogs in the system and have decided that 18 months is too long.  I welcome that the Minister has produced this Bill but ask why we should stop at the numbers he set out?  Why not allow ourselves the luxury of appointing judges when the need arises rather than when the Government wants to look after its friends?  Retiring judges need not be replaced once there are sufficient judges and the backlog has been reduced to an acceptable level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a pity we are not using the opportunity of this Bill to address other inadequacies in the Courts Service, such as the need for modern courts, facilities for witnesses and victims and <Col N="177"/>video links for children.  Situations should not arise like the one I observed in which bloodstained evidence was spread on the floor in front of the parents of a deceased child.  We should ensure that the service is user friendly for everybody and that judges and court officials take pride in the speed at which they meet their responsibilities in terms of avoiding delays in the rest of the justice system.  The High Court should be accessible rather than allowing damage to be caused to individual reputations because of lengthy delays.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill and will be supporting it.  However, it is regrettable that Members will not set a number greater than that which is proposed in this Bill.  This would afford us the opportunity to use the next two or three years to address delays in the Courts Service.  For example, it would enable the introduction of courts that could sit beyond 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. to address delays.  Moreover, an increasing number of jury trials appear to take longer to come to a decision.  This is to be welcomed, in that jurors are taking their role seriously.  However, if some court cases take longer to complete and others take longer to start in the first place, Members must make proper provision for this and this Bill does not go far enough in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contribution to this debate, during which some significant issues have been raised.  I propose to deal with a few of them.</P>
        <P>As for the ratio of judges, Ireland is one of only four common law states within the European Union.  The definition of a judge in a civil law state such as Spain or Italy differs greatly from the Irish definition.  Judges in such countries are involved in directing investigations.  Consequently, the equivalent to an official in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Ireland would be a judge there.  Similarly, people from the criminal side of the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office &mdash; now the Chief Prosecution Solicitor&rsquo;s office &mdash; would count as judges in the civil law system.  Consequently, it is difficult to know whether one is comparing like with like when one states that Ireland has a low ratio of judges to its population.  In any event, there appears to be general agreement that the appointment of the 14 additional judges is necessary and appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Judicial Studies Institute has organised valuable training of judges and continues to so do.  However, as part of my proposals for the establishment of a judicial council, I intend to give that council responsibility for judicial education and training, as well as the exchange of information among judges on matters that will include sentencing.  I intend to make the Bill available to the joint committee and to take into <Col N="178"/>account in its drafting any views that may emerge from the committee.</P>
        <P>In respect of family law, the Courts Service continues to take initiatives to improve the quality of service provided to those involved in routine and difficult family law cases.  In the Circuit Court, a third family law court has been established to deal with family law business in Dublin.  Moreover, dedicated full-time family law courts are now available in Dublin and Cork and at present, there are dedicated days for family law cases in 45 District Court venues nationwide.</P>
        <P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe raised a number of points, including the possibility of prescribing a substantial number of judges by law and then leaving it to the Executive to appoint judges as and when it saw fit by reference to numbers or needs etc.  This would constitute a change from the existing system, which in itself is not too bad.  However, there are issues such as how it would interface with the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  It would be strange if the latter had many vacancies but the Government did not propose to fill them.  Moreover, as a general principle, when I propose to appoint additional judges, a debate takes place in this House.  This is not the worst of outcomes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be like signing blank cheques.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On the other hand, had I introduced a Bill this evening to the effect that the maximum number of judges of the High Court would be 100, I would have received a sceptical reception from Opposition Members.  They would have asked the purpose of the Bill and whether I intended to fill the posts when I thought it appropriate, without informing them.  This cuts both ways.  I am unsure whether I would get much traction in this House were I to propose the creation of a series of vacancies that I had no intention of filling and which my successors and I would fill when we thought it wise to so do, without being responsible or accountable to the House as to why we might decide to fill them at any given time.  Such points go on the other side of the scales.  It is inconvenient to be obliged to come before the House.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would be much more convenient for me to simply sign a statutory instrument or whatever and get on with it.  However, the constitutional order is there.</P>
        <P>Imagine if I had a big tranche of unappointed judged sitting there waiting for me.  Some would suggest that I had created these vacancies and held them over the present Judiciary <i>in terrorem</i>.  In other words, I could decide to appoint another ten judges and send them down to the Four Courts if I did not like the manner in which the Judiciary was dealing with cases one afternoon.  People would claim that this constituted dicta<Col N="179"/>torial executive power.  Consequently, it is in the interests of this House to hold the reins.  I would also make the same point were I sitting on the Opposition benches.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I dealt with sentencing guidelines in my opening speech and the Courts Service is working towards their introduction.  Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe asked whether this House should set out tariffs and the like.  While some jurisdictions have so done, there has been a tradition in Ireland since independence that in general, the Judiciary should not have minimum sentences prescribed to it.  In my speech to which Deputy Cuffe referred, I made the point that it is better to leave it to the Judiciary at large, save in exceptional circumstances.  I dealt with the section 15A drug dealing issue in that speech as an exception to the general rule that it is not the business of the Legislature to direct minimum standards of sentencing to the Judiciary.</P>
        <P>In any event, the power to suspend sentences more or less makes nonsense of minimum standards.  For the sake of argument, assume the House set the minimum standard rate for a burglary at three years.  I am unsure whether that would be a good idea.  However, a judge could then examine the circumstances before him, in which a young man intended to go straight, had a girlfriend, intended to marry and all the rest and could decide to give him a chance by suspending the sentence.  What does it then mean if such an individual received a three year suspended sentence in such circumstances?</P>
        <P>The power of this House to guide the Judiciary in respect of sentencing should be very sparingly used.  It should be directed towards those cases in which there is a clear public perception that it is necessary to exercise such power.  This is as far as I would put it.  I made this point at the lecture from which Deputy Cuffe quoted.  I stated that the general rule should be that it should be left to the judges to decide and that the House should only do otherwise in exceptional cases.</P>
        <P>Although two Members suggested I apologised to the Judiciary, this was not the case.  I was restating what has always been my position, namely, that I have the greatest of respect for judges.  I have said it in their presence and in their absence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is perfectly open to Opposition Members to express their views on the adequacy or otherwise of sentencing.  They do so <Col N="180"/>frequently and Deputy Gregory probably does so as often as a clock strikes.  Equally however, it is also open to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, if he or she thinks that sentencing policy in any area is mistaken, to say so in public.  I do not accept the proposition argued in the House that there are ways in which I could convey this in private.  In other words, I could telephone the president of a court to suggest I thought he or she was treating burglaries lightly in his or her court.  I would not do such a thing and would not be tempted to so do.  As a former Attorney General, I have never heard of anyone communicating policy views to the Judiciary through some kind of back channel, in which a Minister could suggest the Judiciary was not doing its job and that he or she wanted X or Y done.  It simply does not happen and I do not intend to do it.  If I have a view which I want to communicate to the Judiciary, the public should know I communicated that view and should be able to judge what I stated.  It is fine if the public does not agree with it.  It is not populism.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I know in his wisdom, the Ceann Comhairle ruled out of order the amendments I tabled because they would involve a potential charge on revenue.  However, the purpose of the Bill and this section and section 3 in particular will mean a potential charge on revenue.  The explanatory memorandum details the salaries of a High Court judge, Circuit Court judge and District Court judge.  I will not dispute the figures.</P>
        <P>Other potential charges are made on revenue by the fact we will appoint extra judges.  Again, I do not have a problem with this.  However, it is a bit rich that those of us who try to encourage extra judges to facilitate the lessening of queues and waiting lists for courts cannot make those proposals and have them debated in this House.</P>
        <P>In the Minister&rsquo;s summing up on Second Stage, he stated he did not want to have too high a number of judges because a future Minister with responsibility for justice would appoint every one of them.  Regarding the number of High Court judges, the Bill states it &ldquo;shall not be more than 35&rdquo;.  I suggested 41.  The phrase used in the Bill is &ldquo;shall not be more than&rdquo; and &ldquo;more than&rdquo; is the important part.  It means a future Minister with responsibility for justice would not have to fill every position.</P>
        <P>Having spent a number of years here, if the number was 50 I believe a Minister for Finance would prevent a Minister with responsibility for justice from filling all those positions if there was no need to do so because the Courts Service operated fully, the court system had no delays, the courts worked like clockwork and justice was being seen to be done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the questions raised in this section is when we appoint additional judges space must be found for them to sit.  Other officials are associated with the appointments.  Where will the new buildings be?  I heard Kilmainham courthouse will close.  I remember the Minister telling us in 2003 about the new court buildings on Parkgate Street to replace the High Court buildings.</P>
        <P>A building programme exists throughout the country.  Has it been accelerated?  Is there enough space for additional ordinary judges of the High Court whom the Minister hopes to appoint?  He did not come here to increase the number allowed only.  He intends to fill the vacancies.  Perhaps he wants to provide an opportunity in case of an eventuality.  Will the Minister address these points?</P>

The referendum promised on the five proposals from the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with special responsibility for children will have implications.  It is a pity account was not taken of it in this short Bill.  Mandatory provision could have been made for court accompanying services, screening and video linking for children and other vulnerable witnesses.  It could also have examined having a commissioner such as in Scotland to take evidence from vulnerable child witnesses.</P>
        <P>Some courts cannot physically cope with the level of cases and the number of people going through.  We need additional and modern courts and extra facilities.  If the number of Circuit Court judges is being increased extra space must be found.  A building programme has been in place but it has not gone far enough or fast enough to deal with the level of backlog in the courts system.</P>

        <P>The districts and their number are currently the subject matter of a proposal to redraw them.  Inevitably, in the District Court with family law cases and the like, there is a significant requirement for flexibility.  There was a time when a District Court judge was available in every district and it was only if a judge became seriously ill that someone would substitute.  With family law cases and substantial lists of civil cases appearing, etc., it is necessary to have much more flexibility in the approach to the appointment of judges.</P>

        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><P FLI="0">The Government has decided today that emergency legislation should be introduced in the House today to amend the Health Insurance <Col N="185"/>Acts.  This urgent measure is required to support our system of community rating that ensures health insurance is affordable for older and sicker people.  It closes any potential abuse of the three-year exemption from risk equalisation payments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputies will be familiar with the regulatory framework which underpins the operation of the private health insurance market in Ireland.  The key elements of this framework have been supported by successive Governments.  These are community rating, open enrolment and minimum benefits.  The adoption of this approach to regulating the market has been part of the reason the level of private health insurance coverage in Ireland is unique in Europe.  Approximately 52% of the population has health insurance cover.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P Just="Left">There are many reasons why people choose to buy health insurance cover.  Many people in Ireland choose to do so because it is affordable.  Even more importantly, it remains affordable throughout people&rsquo;s working lives and into retirement.  We all know we are more likely to need expensive medical treatment later in our lives rather than earlier.  In most countries and as part of a risk rated insurance market, health insurance premiums increase as people get older and as a reflection of the higher risk of claims related to ageing.</P>
        <P>In Ireland the policy of community rating means health insurers cannot discriminate against older customers and must offer their various plans to subscribers at the same cost regardless of age or medical history.  I believe this is a fair and equitable approach.  Apart from keeping health insurance affordable, it is a practical demonstration of intergenerational solidarity whereby the younger and healthier section of the population pays more than would be needed in a risk-rated market but who themselves benefit in later life when they might be expected to pay prohibitive premiums if their higher risk were to be reflected in the price paid.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is generally accepted that a community rated market cannot operate as intended if insurers in the market have markedly different risk profiles.  Some mechanism is required to balance the risks and spread them across the market so the different insurers can offer community rated products.  For this reason all community rated markets also have a risk equalisation mechanism of some nature to balance the risks.</P>
        <P>New entrants to the market typically tend to attract younger subscribers with a lower than average risk of claiming under their policies.  There is plenty of evidence to suggest that existing older health insurance subscribers are reluctant to switch their business to new entrants.</P>
        <P>To counteract this phenomenon the Health Insurance Acts have allowed new entrants to the market to avail of a three year exemption from the obligation to make risk equalisation payments that might otherwise be levied on them as a result of their having a more favourable risk profile. <Col N="186"/> The exemption was intended to give new entrants the opportunity to establish themselves and to build a market share.  It was clearly the intention of the Oireachtas when the measure was enacted that this exemption should be confined to new entrants coming into the market seeking to build market share from zero by organic growth.</P>
        <P>It was recognised that the exemption could be open to abuse by an existing insurer reincorporating itself or establishing an associated company and seeking to secure a second three year exemption by claiming to be a new entrant.  Section 12B of the Principal Act &mdash; inserted by section 10 of the Act of 2001 &mdash; was amended in 2003 to prevent such a move.</P>
        <P>However, the amended legislation did not encompass the situation which emerged with the announcement on 31 January by the Quinn Group that it had reached an arrangement with BUPA for a takeover of the latter&rsquo;s Irish operations.  This development followed BUPA&rsquo;s announcement on 14 December that it was withdrawing from the Irish market following the dismissal of its High Court challenge to the risk equalisation scheme.</P>
        <P>I want to emphasise that the Government and I welcome the Quinn Group&rsquo;s interest in entering this market.  It has built a strong reputation and a successful business in the reformed motor insurance market and has been a positive influence on the level of competition in that market.  I have not seen the legal agreement between the Quinn Group and BUPA for the transfer of the BUPA Ireland business to the Quinn Group.  However, the Attorney General has advised that the potential exists for an incumbent or a non-incumbent to avail of the three year exemption by particular corporate transactions, in essence, acquiring or restructuring the business of an existing player in the market.</P>
        <P>In the Government&rsquo;s view the securing of the exemption in this way would constitute a frustration of the intention of the Oireachtas when it passed this measure into law.  The Government has been advised that this loophole should be closed as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has decided, based on legal advice, that the most effective means of achieving this is to remove the exemption for new entrants in its entirety.  The removal will become effective immediately when the Bill now before the House is signed by the President.  It will not affect the exemption which VIVAS presently has and which expires in October 2007.  Clearly, it does not prejudice the ability of the Government to form policy for the market or the Oireachtas to pass further legislation at any time.  On the other hand, not to close the exemption now would have constrained policy development in a significant way.</P>
        <P>Section 1 of the Bill contains standard provisions dealing with definitions.  Section 2 provides that under existing legislation risk equalis<Col N="187"/>ation payments apply to existing undertakings.  However, it is considered prudent to put beyond doubt, that should an undertaking no longer be on the Health Insurance Authority Register of Undertakings, it should be liable for risk equalisation payments in respect of contracts written when it was a registered undertaking.</P>
        <P>Section 3 is a technical amendment which follows on from section 2.  Section 4 repeals the limited three year exemption from risk equalisation for new entrants to the market with immediate effect.  The purpose of the exemption was to promote competition in the market by allowing new entrants a period of time during which market share can be built up before risk equalisation payments fall due to be paid.  However, the exemption has the potential to be exploited by a company which acquires an existing undertaking or associated company to avoid making risk equalisation payments.</P>
        <P>The Government believes it is therefore necessary to enact legislation to prevent such abuse.  Section 5 provides for the usual Short Title and collective citation.  I have repeatedly restated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintaining community rating in this market and to promoting greater competition.</P>
        <P>I also want to ensure that the regulatory framework does not place unnecessary obstacles in the way of companies seeking to enter the market and allows them earn a reasonable return on capital.  For that reason I have appointed a market review group chaired by Mr. Colm Barrington to examine whether, having regard to all aspects of the current market here and the need to maintain community rating, it is possible for current and prospective participants in the health insurance market to earn a rate of return on capital employed which would be regarded as adequate for the insurance industry.</P>
        <P>When I receive the Barrington report at the end of March I expect to bring it, along with the reports of the Competition Authority and the Health Insurance Authority, together with my recommendations, to the Government in April for a decision.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Coveney.</P>
        <P>This whole issue about health insurance has been going on since April 2005.  Extensive debates have taken place at meetings of the Joint Committee of Health and Children on every aspect of health insurance, with the Health Insurance Authority, VIVAS, VHI, BUPA, the Minister for Health and Children and the Department of Health and Children since April 2005.  I want to make clear Fine Gael&rsquo;s position.  We fully support competition and community rating.  With community rating we fully support risk equalisation, which we want to keep in this marketplace. <Col N="188"/> However, we want to know from the Minister what is going on, why this legislation is so necessary and what exactly she is doing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This legislation basically abolishes the three year derogation rule for any new entrants to this marketplace.  It seems the Minister is only abolishing this derogation because Se&aacute;n Quinn was going to get away with it.  I am sure he is no fan of mine so there is no vested interest in my saying that what the Minister is doing will damage competition in the private health insurance market because she has left this to the last minute as usual.  This issue has been bubbling under the surface for at least 12 months and she has left it to the last minute to deal with it, which is a major concern.</P>
        <P>What will happen in the sector for private health insurance customers?  VHI customers may not pay the price for this mess created by the Government immediately.  It may take six or nine months for those customers to see their premiums increase because of this mess, as it might take BUPA that long to exit the market.  However, tomorrow morning we may well learn that BUPA customers have again to deal with another unholy mess created by the Government last December.  The Minister has rushed through legislation on something she has not fully thought through and she does not know where she is going with it.  That is of major concern to Members on this side of the House.</P>
        <P>As this side of the House has no access to information the Minister has about how private insurance companies operate in the market, there is speculation that a report which was supposed to have been prepared by the Health Insurance Authority, an agency of the Minister&rsquo;s Department which gives her advice on this issue, states that new insurance companies should be given a financial advantage for seven years instead of the present three years.  That report was leaked; it was put on the Minister&rsquo;s desk this month.  This legislation removes that derogation.  Members on this side of the House have no access to the information the Minister has on this issue.  There seems to be contradictions in regard to it, even when account is taken of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report.  The Barrington group will report in March.  For an issue that affects 2 million of our citizens, this seems to be an unbelievable mess.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To say that rushed legislation is bad legislation is one thing, but I find it extremely difficult to support this legislation because I am not sure where the Minister is going with it.  She has made clear that perhaps this is to get at Se&aacute;n Quinn, but I am concerned about whether it will affect competition and community rating.  Should the Minister in the past 18 months not have been examining ways of tweaking risk equalisation to make the market work?  She is probably on the verge of setting the private health insurance market back to where it was in 1995 when the <Col N="189"/>VHI was the only company in this marketplace.  When it had a monopoly it provided less of a service at more of a cost.  Competition improved that position.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael supports competition, community rating and risk equalisation, and wants to see what will happen in the private health insurance market for BUPA and VHI customers.  This is such a serious issue that I am sure Members on this side of the House, particularly those in Fine Gael, must oppose this legislation on the basis that the Minister does not seem to know where she is going with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I reaffirm what our health spokesperson has said.  Fine Gael supports community rating and the necessity for risk equalisation to support it.  Nobody wants to see elderly people being priced out of the private health insurance market.  I believe we support what the Minister is aiming to do with this legislation.  BUPA is leaving the market and fair-minded people believe that it should be required to pay what it owes under risk equalisation.  There is no problem with that issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Quinn insurance group has taken over the BUPA client base, and there is concern about the loophole it aims to take advantage of by not paying risk equalisation payments for three years.  I can understand why the Minister would try to close that loophole and we do not have a problem with that principle.  The problem is that the strategy the Minister is using to do that has consequences for the health insurance market moving forward.  Essentially, it signals there will be no incentive for a company outside Ireland to consider entering the Irish health insurance market and offering a service at a fair price.  If an outside company were contemplating entering the Irish market and noted that the VHI and VIVAS, if Quinn Direct decides to leave the market after this decision, are the only operators in it, it could see no financial sense in entering a marketplace with no incentive or no competitive advantage to allow it to settle into that marketplace, which was the reasoning behind the risk equalisation payment exemption for three years.  This is an extraordinary decision.  The Minister is admitting that we will not invite or encourage any new entrants into the Irish health insurance market, which is a step backward as regards competition in this sector.</P>
        <P>Was it not possible for the Minister to consider specifically targeting the Quinn Direct group and the loophole it plans to take advantage of by, for example, aiming to ensure that the incentive of not having to pay risk equalisation payments for three years would not exist for companies taking over an existing client base?  Would that not have solved the problem?  Why have we got to go the whole hog and ensure that nobody considering entering the Irish market can have the incentive <Col N="190"/>of being exempt for the first three years from risk equalisation payments?  This clearly worked in the past in terms of encouraging BUPA to enter the marketplace, but that incentive was not over the top as not too many others have sought to enter the Irish marketplace.  Why was that not possible?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not believe the Fine Gael Party has a problem with what the Minister is trying to do in this emergency legislation, but we have a big problem with the unforeseen consequences or the by-product of it, which is to remove the incentive to attract new entrants into the Irish health insurance market which could provide more competition and more choice for consumers.  That is the problem.  That is the reason Fine Gael will oppose this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very regrettable that we have been put in this position by the Government.  At 6.10 p.m. we were informed by the Minister that legislation would be rushed through the House without us having a chance of ensuring it would undergo proper scrutiny, care and attention, which is the way things should be done.  I object to the fact that, in effect, a legislative gun is being put to the head of the Opposition in regard to this legislation.  </P>
        <P>The Labour Party has and will support risk equalisation and community rating.  They are the fundamentals that ensure people are protected and have access to health insurance.  I suppose we can be grateful to the Minister that she has not abandoned both community rating and risk equalisation.  However, we are extremely concerned at the failure of the Government to safeguard both community rating and risk equalisation in a competitive market where people can have a choice, something which the Minister certainly espoused in the past but has not lived up to.  Instead what is being created is a muddle at best and a risk at worse, a risk to jobs and to people who have taken out health insurance who are worried about their future.  The most extraordinary thing about this is that it need never have arisen that we find ourselves in this position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2003 legislation was passed by this House.  The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, put through the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill and he promised, &ldquo;The second [provision of the Bill] is to ensure that the temporary exemption from risk equalisation, which has as its objective the encouragement of competition, can be availed of only by genuine new entrants to the market&rdquo;.  We were told that was the purpose of the Bill and we accept it in good faith.  It is getting to the stage where one cannot believe anything this Government says, but that is what we were promised.  He outlined the various sections, including section 6.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Section 6 is concerned with the arrangements in place to facilitate and encourage the entry of <Col N="191"/>new insurers into the market to provide greater competition and choice to consumers.  The legislation provides for insurance undertakings that have not yet commenced business to avail of a three year exemption from risk equalisation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We know the purpose of this.  The provision of the Bill retained the measure of risk equalisation.  However, he went on to state:</P>
        <P LI="1">The main purpose of amending the existing provision is to avoid a possibility that the exemption could be availed of through the creation of a subsidiary or some other form of associated company by an existing undertaking.  This approach is considered desirable to remove any possibility of an issue of avoidance arising in the arrangements ... It aims to ensure the exemption will only apply in circumstances where the added value for consumers of private health insurance is a genuine increase in the choice of insurers and greater real competition in the market.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Somebody was looking at the problem, but somebody did not see how far the problem extended.  Companies such as Mercers were brought in to advise on this complex matter.  Civil servants were also involved.  There was no lack of advice to ensure the legislation would encompass measures to deal with the risks inherent in the system.  We dealt with one risk and the other was ignored.  This was a commitment made by a Minister to guarantee by legislation that there would be competition and that nobody would avoid living up to his or her responsibilities.  It was another broken promise and here we are trying to fix the mess.</P>
        <P>The Minister said she had not seen the legal agreement between Quinn Direct and BUPA.  This raises issues about the extent of what we are facing.  If she does not know anything about the legal agreement, what does she know about the future of the 330 jobs in Fermoy?  Each worker has been living through a very anxious time in recent months.  The workers are mainly young people with mortgages who do not know where they stand.  What will happen to them now?  That is one practical outcome, even though we have not been asked to look at all the implications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the future for competition?  It is hard to envisage any future for it.  If a three-year derogation on risk equalisation was designed to assist new insurers to come into the market, what will happen when there is no derogation?  The Bill will get rid of derogations; therefore, the tender plants will not even have a chance to grow.  The Minister is in effect stating we will not see competition.  The chairperson of the Competition Authority made a statement to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, in which he specifically recommended that VHI&rsquo;s exemption from prudential regulation should be brought to <Col N="192"/>an end as soon as possible in order that it would become subject to the legal solvency requirements and corporate structuring rules applying to other health insurers.  This is a cause of great complaint from the competitors of VHI.  A timeframe was set out, but the Competition Authority is clearly indicating that such a timeframe is not acceptable.  I would like the Minister to respond to this.</P>
        <P>If the Bill is signed into law by the President after midnight, when will it become law under the Interpretation Act?  Will it become law from midnight or from midnight tomorrow?  My party cannot support the Government when it pushes through emergency legislation without any chance of ensuring it is robust.  There are real risks and I have no doubt that the Bill will be challenged in the courts.  Risk equalisation has already been the subject of court action and the Minister is right to say she succeeded in the courts following the BUPA challenge.  However, that will not stop future court challenges, especially when situations such as this could have been avoided.</P>
        <P>There was a clear concern expressed about the difficulties with derogation during the debate on the 2003 Bill.  However, there seemed to be no ability within the Department or the ministerial team to do anything.  Of course, the then Minister&rsquo;s advisers never read a brief, just like the Minister himself; perhaps, therefore, we should not be surprised.  Nonetheless, they touched the surface and dealt with one loophole, but they did not deal with this one and we are now trying to play catch-up in an area worth millions of euro.  Derogation is worth millions and any company will try to ensure it can hold on to a derogation to avoid the levying of a large bill.  That is what companies do and one should not expect them to do anything other than this.  We are talking about huge amounts of money, yet the Government has failed to recognise and acknowledge that what should have been done in 2002 was not done.  We are now being given a Bill at the last minute and asked to accept it in good faith without going through it in detail.  Frankly, we cannot do this.  We must remember that there are individuals taking out insurance who will be affected by this and that there are hundreds of people working today who thought the crisis had passed.  Their concerns need to be foremost in our minds tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sharing my time with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and Deputy Connolly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a complete mess and not the way to legislate.  I was in my constituency this evening trying to explain to people the reason for Government confusion about the proposed incinerator when I received a telephone call.  I now see its confusion about this issue.  Has so-called competition worked?  It was suggested that when VHI <Col N="193"/>had a monopoly, prices were much higher.  However, in the past six years premiums have increased substantially, by up to 80%.  Competition has not worked.  In the Canadian model there is a natural monopoly, with one insurer providing universal health insurance.  Surely, that is a model we need to examine.  If there are a number of insurance companies in the market, we need the community rating model, with risk equalisation.  However, what model of risk equalisation is the Minister talking about?  Various models have been brought forward.  Mr. Se&aacute;n Barrett and even representatives of BUPA have spoken about sharing the patient load proportionately to ensure every single insurance company has the same proportion of high risk patients.</P>
        <P>Under EU directives, one company can have a monopoly if there is universal health insurance.  We know VHI is trying to increase its reserves as it is fattening itself up for privatisation at some future date.  What we have is false competition.  There is no real competition in the market.  The bottom line is what is best for the patient.  That is what we, as policy makers, need to ask ourselves.  If we continue along these lines, the two-tier health service will continue.</P>
        <P>Many people have told me stories about private primary care services.  My next door neighbour dislocated his shoulder and was told that it would be fine if he paid &euro;200.  The situation whereby people who have health insurance continue to have a significant advantage over those who are uninsured cannot continue.  We need to engage in a detailed examination of the manner in which we are proceeding.  We are introducing legislation at 10 p.m. to close a loophole, but we will have to revisit this matter on many occasions to sort out this mess.  The T&aacute;naiste needs to examine the system thoroughly.  On that basis, I cannot support this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Tonight&rsquo;s developments raise further significant questions about the Government&rsquo;s inept handling of the health care system.  Private health insurance in Ireland has been a fiasco from the outset.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose this legislation because to do so would hurt normal taxpayers, who have to scrimp and save to try to compensate for the failure of successive Governments to put in place a decent public health care system.  Approximately 50% of the population have been driven into the clutches of health insurance companies as a result of the Government&rsquo;s failures.  I do not want to contribute to any further draining of the resources of people who are suffering because of those failures.  Sinn F&eacute;in, which believes that health care is fundamentally incompatible with the market, is in favour of free health care at the point of delivery.  It should be based on need rather than on ability to pay.</P><Col N="194"/>
        <P>The fiasco involving BUPA Ireland, Quinn Direct and VHI exposes the fundamental contradiction within the two-tier system, which is that many people have to pay twice &mdash; they make PRSI contributions and then spend more money to meet expensive private health insurance costs.  The Government needs to answer many questions on how it handled the fall-out from the sale of BUPA Ireland.  It is obvious that many people have questions about the Government&rsquo;s handling of the MRSA crisis and the ongoing problems with accident and emergency services.  There is no area of the health service in which delivery matches the type of service that is required.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, needs to answer questions about this proposal, about which Members were informed at a late stage.  When did she receive the legal advice on which this Bill is based?  If she was given that advice when it was announced that BUPA Ireland had been sold, why did she delay the legislation until now?  If this proposal is so important, why have we not been given more time in which to discuss it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>The pace with which this Bill is being brought through the House this evening reminds me of a hurricane or a tornado that is sweeping all opposition out of its path.  As an earlier speaker said, rushed legislation is not good or safe.  What impact will this Bill have on Quinn Direct&rsquo;s decision to purchase BUPA Ireland?  I presume Quinn Direct will not touch BUPA Ireland with a barge pole after this move.  Risk equalisation seems to be an imperative for all entrants to the health insurance market.  This Bill was triggered by the acquisition of BUPA Ireland, which entered the health insurance market in 1997 to offer a greater variety of products.  BUPA Ireland built up a customer base of 450,000 people, which was quite a significant achievement.  BUPA Ireland argued that the risk equalisation scheme would have caused it to spend more than twice its annual profits on subsidising its competitor.  I do not believe it could have tolerated such a position.  When it threatened to pull out of the Irish market many people thought it was bluffing, but we now know it was not.  Despite the fact that VHI has 80% of this country&rsquo;s health insurance market, BUPA Ireland was also compelled, under the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001, to pay an unspecified sum to the ESB staff scheme.</P>
        <P>I was delighted when I heard that BUPA Ireland had been bought by Quinn Direct and I was looking forward to the arrival of that company in the Irish market.  I thought the company would be a breath of fresh air in the health insurance market just as it was in the car insurance market, in which it handled and settled claims in a unique manner.  Quinn Direct would have brought real competition to the health insurance sector, but it is likely that we will lose <Col N="195"/>a real competitor, tragically.  The third health insurance provider, VIVAS, is also enjoying a grace period of three years before it will become subject to the risk equalisation rules.  I wonder if its honeymoon will be cut short by this legislation.  Before Quinn Direct tried to enter the health insurance market, over 450,000 Irish consumers had been disenfranchised of their right to opt for the private health insurer of their choice.</P>
        <P>The Government and VHI have vigorously argued that risk equalisation is essential if community rating is to be maintained.  There is no evidence &mdash; merely some suggestions &mdash; that BUPA Ireland and VIVAS have engaged in risk selection, or cherry-picking, that would undermine community rating.  Quite simply, community rating, which is mandatory, is not merely an end in itself &mdash; it is a means to the end of ensuring that private health insurance remains affordable for the older population.  We should think twice about this legislation, which is being rushed in an unhealthy manner, because it will drive competition out of the market.</P>

	<P>They say a week is a long time in politics, but it is clear that a couple of hours is a long time in politics.  I accept that Deputies had to reflect after this afternoon&rsquo;s briefing on this legislation.  I want to repeat the comments I made when I spoke frankly and honestly at the briefing.  I was asked when the Department became aware of this difficulty.  The possibility that there may be a loophole of this nature arose sometime last summer, during the court case that BUPA Ireland took against the State.  When we sought legal advice, we were told we should not amend the legislation until the court issued its judgment, which took place at the end of last year.</P>
        <P>Quinn Direct did not acquire BUPA Insurance, which is the company that is authorised to offer health insurance in Ireland, or BUPA UK.  It acquired BUPA Ireland, which is a customer service company that is authorised to do such business here.  When the legislation was amended in 2003, this was not envisaged.  When risk equalisation was introduced in 1996 by the parties opposite, it received the support of all parties in the House.  When we were opening up the health insurance industry, everybody recognised that if one company had older members and another company had younger members, community rating could not be maintained without a system of risk equalisation.  VHI has three younger members for every older member, whereas BUPA Ireland has 18 younger members for every older member.  It is clear that if we have community rating, companies cannot compete on a level playing field in such circumstances.</P>
        <P>The Health Insurance Authority report recommended that there should be a longer phase-in <Col N="196"/>period.  It recommended that the relevant companies should pay 25%, rather than 50%, in the first year and that it should be phased in over four years.  I intend to bring proposals to the Cabinet in April, based on the Health Insurance Authority report, the Competition Authority report and the report of the Barrington group.  I established the Barrington group, which comprises three well-respected people who know about the world of investment and insurance, because BUPA Ireland has maintained that it cannot make a fair return on capital, whereas VHI does not have to make a return on capital.  Like everybody else, I know that companies will not join the market if they cannot make a return on capital.  I have asked the Barrington group to examine any issues which need to be addressed in the context of community rating.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I want community rating and competition, above all else.  My colleagues in Government and I will do whatever it takes to have both.  I have been advised by legal personnel and others who are experts in this area that as long as there is a three year holiday, which does not exist in other countries which have risk equalisation, one will never be certain that a company will not exit after three years. A company could come in, grow a business, make some money and leave after three years when the holiday is over.  For example in a situation where a company paid no tax for three years, why should it do something different in year four?  I am strongly advised that if we want certainty and competition it is uncompetitive to have the three year holiday.  When the legislation was introduced it was an 18-month period which was subsequently increased to three years.  BUPA was in Ireland for ten years before risk equalisation applied.</P>
<HtmlBk SectId="10" />
        <P>On the question of my reason for taking this action tonight, I explained to the Deputies opposite that the Quinn Group cannot be authorised before 28 February 2007 when IFSRA will meet and the group must then be registered by the Health Insurance Authority.  VIVAS has contacted the Department and informed it that if the Quinn Group is going to use this legal loophole then it certainly does not intend to start paying risk equalisation this year and it will use a similar vehicle.  Unlike the Quinn Group, VIVAS did not have to go for authorisation as it is already authorised.  If it were to go into business with a health insurer in Europe, for example, all it needed to do was walk into the HIA and re-register which it could have done up to 5.30 p.m. this evening.  This is the reason it was not possible for me to talk to people before 5.30 p.m.  The Cabinet approved this legislation this afternoon in an incorporeal meeting.  A sub-committee of the <Col N="197"/>Cabinet which included myself and the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the T&aacute;naiste and the Attorney General worked and prepared this legislation.  This is the reason it had to be done this evening.  It takes legal effect from midnight tonight so nobody can walk into the HIA tomorrow and use the existing loophole to avoid risk equalisation payments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I said to the Deputies opposite, I do not feel good about introducing emergency legislation and presenting people with a couple of hours to discuss it but I had no alternative.  I had to act in the public interest in protecting community rating.  If we did not do this, there is no doubt that community rating would have collapsed and nobody would be paying risk equalisation before the end of 2010.  This would not be an acceptable position.</P>
        <P>A number of actions need to be taken.  The VHI does not have to meet the solvency requirements of its competitors and this is unsatisfactory.  I have already received clearance from the Government to prepare legislation to put the VHI on a commercial footing.  I have already given the VHI direction that it must act now in everything it does to prepare for meeting the solvency requirements which are very strict.</P>
        <P>The solvency requirements require 40% of premium income to be put aside towards a solvency fund.  The figure is 25% in other countries because health insurance, unlike other insurance, has more certainty.  I would like to think that our regulatory body could examine the solvency issue because the VHI could be commercialised a lot quicker.</P>
        <P>Other issues need to be considered.  I have been advised in some reports that we should have lifetime community rating, which means that a person joining when they are 25 would earn a bonus as opposed to a person joining when they are 50.  This would encourage young people to join and has been recommended in all the reports.  The insurance companies active in the market would also support this initiative and I would like to see this introduced.  I would welcome the issue of renewal notices a month in advance and providing information on the notice that a person may switch insurer without incurring a penalty because many people are not aware of this.  I also refer to a number of initiatives relat<Col N="198"/>ing to health insurance in general which I took in my last job.</P>
        <P>It comes down to the fact that 52% of the population has health insurance because it is affordable.  I recently spoke to an Irish couple in their 60s who had been in the UK for a number of years.  Their health insurance in the UK cost &pound;12,000 whereas it is &euro;2,200 in Ireland.  This is the reason that only 11% of the population in Britain can afford health insurance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Health insurance is a good option.  The measures being taken tonight will protect the 2 million citizens who have private health insurance by making insurance affordable, particularly when they are sicker and older.  I do not agree with Deputy Gormley that we should go back to a monopoly provider.  Monopolies in general are never innovative because they do not have to be and they do not give good value for money.</P>
        <P>I want to see a competitive market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I asked some of the companies that came knocking on my door recently to explain the reason they did not come into the market before.  One replied they thought the Irish market was at saturation point at 37% a number of years and they never envisaged it would grow to 52% of the population.  The market has grown by encouraging younger people to join, particularly in times of economic success and health insurance is more affordable.  The market can grow further and I want to see more entrants to this market.  I am determined to work with the Government to make sure we take all the steps necessary to have competition based on community rating and not based on any other criteria.  This requires younger people supporting older people and risk equalisation payments to be made.  I am asking the House to pass this legislation tonight to protect this.</P>

	<P>Cork Airport is a flagship development resource for the region and anything that would enhance and support the development of the airport as an independent entity is something I would support.  I have supported such development for years.</P>
        <P>From the outset, I supported the break-up of Aer Rianta, the establishment of independent airport authorities and the assurance of long-term financial viability for the three airports.  From the Cork perspective, I do not want any burden placed on Cork Airport that would inherently infringe on its financial viability and integrity for the future.  I welcome the investment made in Cork Airport, with a new terminal and the ability for it to cater for up to 5 million passengers.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have a few questions for the Minister.  First, in the event of Cork Airport taking on the &euro;100 million debt to finance the redevelopment, will the airport be financially viable in the future?  Second, will there be satisfactory pension provisions for the workers and those currently reliant on pensions?  Third, will the geographic integrity of Cork <Col N="201"/>Airport be maintained?  We are aware that 40 acres of Cork Airport lands were advertised some time ago for a business park development.</P>
        <P>If we could address the issues related to the 40 acres, pension provisions and the viability of the airport so that no inherent burden is placed on the airport that would put it at an economic disadvantage and make it uncompetitive in the market, many people would be satisfied.  I hope the Minister can clarify these points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>When Shannon and Dublin airports were redeveloped the funding came from central airport funds.  Cork Airport is entitled to the same treatment.  It is disingenuous of Dublin Airport management and Dublin-based Senators and others to say that if Cork is funded from central funds, it will lead to a significant increase in individual passenger charges for Dublin passengers.  Deputy Kelleher made the point that Aer Rianta has a whole range of prosperous assets and associated facilities.  In that context, it looks like the company law requirements on capital maintenance rules could be easily overcome if the will existed to do so.</P>
        <P>Cork Airport has done an excellent job in consistently increasing the throughput of passengers.  Our concern is that the &euro;100 million debt will stop that progress.  We cannot compare Cork with Dublin, the country&rsquo;s capital, where there is a tenfold greater throughput of passengers.  Unfortunately, we have experts on one hand telling us that Cork Airport will have no problem absorbing a &euro;100 million debt, while experts on the other hand say it will keep the airport grounded and could destroy it.</P>
        <P>I am no expert on aviation matters, but I have worked with Cork Airport management and staff over the years to get us to where we are.  I do not want to see that work jeopardised now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, has made the decision to burden Cork Airport Authority with a &euro;100 million debt which is a result of the incompetence of his Government and which had nothing to do with the incoming Cork Airport board.  The board will now have to implement measures to service this massive debt.</P>
        <P>Inevitably, these measures will have an impact on the travelling public as well as the carriers operating in and out of Cork.  This disgraceful decision will set back balanced regional development for years and will make Cork Airport uncompetitive.  It must be seen as the worst U-turn from the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, which gave a cast iron promise through the former Minister for Transport to Cork that the airport would begin independent operations debt free and on a level playing field.</P>
        <P>I reject the Minister&rsquo;s misleading statement on today&rsquo;s edition of &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; when he said that the debt-free guarantee was conditional on other issues.  I reject this because it was a clear cut and unambiguous promise made in writing by <Col N="202"/>a senior Cabinet Minister.  If reports are true that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, was involved in brokering the final deal, he should be ashamed of himself and of his inability to deliver on his Government&rsquo;s promise to Cork.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has been indicating that it is right that Cork should shoulder the &euro;60 million overrun on the cost of the new terminal.  This is totally unacceptable because it is the incompetence of the Dublin Airport Authority and the Government that has caused the overrun.  The overrun is typical of the Government&rsquo;s inefficiency in delivering a host of public projects over budget.  The Dublin Airport Authority has already been handsomely compensated for the debt by the proceeds from the sale of the Great Southern Hotels.</P>
        <P>The total area of Cork Airport amounts to 600 acres of land in comparison with both Shannon and Dublin which have over 2,000 acres each.  If the 40 acres, and not 30 as previously stated, is sold off to developers, it will mean that the future development of Cork Airport is not only at risk but is seriously damaged.  It is vital to hold the landbank and the Dublin Airport Authority must be stopped in its asset stripping of Cork.  Not only is the future development of Cork Airport being damaged but the master plan for the airport, which was revised and reaffirmed in recent times, is being thrown out the window.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Government have posed serious threats to the development of not only Cork Airport but the whole south Munster region.  Apparently it is all right to hand over &euro;600 million to a private company in Dublin to deal with the infrastructural problems there, but it is not acceptable to fund a relatively small amount by comparison, &euro;100 million, to make one of the most important pieces of regional infrastructure in the country viable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As for the Minister, this is just the latest in a long list of calamities and disasters over which he has presided.  The &euro;600 million buy-out of the West Link will not see toll barriers being removed for another year and a half.  We had a &euro;60 million electronic voting fiasco and now he is presiding over the Cork Airport fiasco.  The introduction of his Transport 21 plan has also seen the delay and cancellation of numerous transport projects in the Cork area.  The Minister has failed to respond adequately to these issues in Cork.</P>
        <P>It is clear that, under this Government and Minister, Cork&rsquo;s potential is being damaged and the city and county are being overlooked.  For this reason, the Minister should resign.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I should state for the Minister&rsquo;s benefit that he is the most consistent Minister in this Government for persisting in wasting public money and, unfortunately, his decision will have ramifications, not only in the &euro;100 million which he has apportioned to the incoming board of Cork Airport Authority whenever it is allowed be independent, but in how that airport has an opportunity to become viable in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">He has added insult to that injury by deciding that he knows how to manage such an airport by stating that there will not be any requirement to increase airport charges and he seems to be joined in that point of view by my constituency colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin.  He is further joined by another Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who stated that Cork has got the bargain of the century in being apportioned &euro;100 million of debt.  The reality is that if the airport is to be viable, the incoming airport authority will have to be sufficiently profitable to pay the interest on this &euro;100 million loan, the term payments on that loan and to build up a reserve to allow for future developments in this airport.  What kind of mad economics is this from the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, who has managed to personify every mad economic infrastructural decision that this Government has put together in the past five years?</P>

	<P>Not only have we lived with the burden of this decision not being made over the past number of years, but the consequence has been we have seen the development of the Dublin Airport Authority as Aer Rianta mark II, the proper development of Cork Airport has been hindered as a result and now we are entering into a new period of uncertainty when we do not even know when Cork Airport will become independent on the basis of a consultant&rsquo;s report that has not been made public by a body, which has had intrinsic working relationships with the Dublin Airport Authority.  On every ground, this is not only a mess but maladministration of the highest order.  The Minister must justify, not only to this House but to the people of Cork, why he has made decisions that will have serious consequences for the infrastructure of our region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, gave an unequivocal pledge that Dublin Airport would take on the debts of Shannon and Cork airports.  He stated that the major regional airports would begin life as independent and debt-free entities.  Spelling out Government policy, he emphasised that the Dublin Airport Authority, the country&rsquo;s biggest and most profitable operation, would pick up the bill for Shannon and Cork, counterbalancing this by selling off the Great Southern Hotels Group, a national asset which yielded &euro;260 million for the Dublin Airport Authority.  Since then, however, Deputy Cullen has taken over the Transport portfolio and the Brennan promise has been torn up.  That seems to be what it is like.  There is no longer Cabinet responsibility; it is now the individual Minister&rsquo;s responsibility.</P>
        <P>The coalition&rsquo;s clear message for those in the mid-west and southern region is that Dublin comes first and foremost.  The Government yesterday approved the payment of &euro;600 million to buy out the West Link toll bridge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is wrong again.  Where did that happen, just as a matter of interest?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That will increase, by all conservative estimates, to double that figure.  This was done the day before the Government let it be known that Cork Airport Authority must take on a debt of &euro;100 million &mdash; a pittance in comparison with what it will pay for the toll bridge, but then again one is in Dublin, the other is Cork.  Dublin is to get &euro;600 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money so that traffic can move freely on the M50, while Cork <Col N="205"/>gets a bill of &euro;100 million which, no matter how one looks at it, will cripple the airport.</P>
        <P>For the umpteenth time this Administration has walked away from pledges not worth the breath on which they were uttered.  This is an Alice in Wonderland Government where words mean what the Government and the Ministers say they mean, but when we speak of Alice in Wonderland we must never forget Humpty Dumpty.  Like Humpty Dumpty, this Government is in for a great fall and I hope the people of Cork will be the ones to push it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This Administration can be fairly accused of being long on promises but short on action.  The DAA stands accused of asset stripping and also of riding roughshod over the assurances that both Cork and Shannon airports would start with clean balance sheets.  The question the Government has failed to answer is who will end up paying this bill.  Clearly, if both Cork and Shannon airports are saddled with heavy debts they will be forced to pass the extra cost on to passengers using those airports.  Inevitably, that means that they will be hamstrung from the outset and hard put to compete in what has become and very competitive airline business.  So much for regional development.  Where is the national development plan?</P>

	<P>Cork is now to be lumbered with a debt of &euro;100 million by this Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Government, despite its specific earlier commitments to establish the independence of Cork Airport on a debt-free basis.  The Minister, Deputy Cullen, has attempted to justify this action, which has been described as a U-turn but which I describe as just an appalling breach of trust with the people of Cork.</P>
        <P>On top of that attempt at justification and to rub salt into the wounds of the people of Cork, today the Minister has announced the diversion of airport funding of &euro;22.3 million to an airport in his own constituency.  I have no problem with him spending taxpayers&rsquo; money in Waterford, which has claims of its own.  However, it is a supreme irony for this Minister to rob the people of Cork of the &euro;100 million that they were promised on the same day he is spending &euro;22.3 million on the airport in his own constituency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Fine Gael in Waterford against it?  Is that the Fine Gael position?  I will raise it in the morning and ask them to tell the people that is the position.  That is fine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the Minister&rsquo;s credibility, if he has any, for this type of action.  There is no denying that these promises and commitments were made to the people of Cork.  Do promises and commitments mean anything to this Government?  Do they mean anything to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party?  Does that party deny the commitments were made?  What is the justification then for breaking the commitments made by the Minister for Transport in 2003 and by the Taoiseach?  What is the justification for breaking promises and commitments?  Why were they made in the first place?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The consequences for Cork have been spelled out.  There is no justification for this action.  Already, a leading aviation expert has suggested, according to an article in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i>, that this &euro;100 million debt will keep the airport grounded and could destroy it.  He argues facts and figures to that effect.  These are not my figures.  These are the figures of an aviation expert.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to be the sixth person to speak because much has already been said about this issue.  However, the issue can be crystalised into a simple line &mdash; a deal was done and now it has been broken for political convenience and nothing else.  The decision to split up Aer Rianta, which Fine Gael supported in 2003, greatly worried Cork Airport at the time.  As the Minister from Cork knows, the decision to build a new airport terminal at the site had been made at that stage.  The plan was that this would be paid for by the cash cow that was then Dublin Airport.  In an effort to bring Cork on board with that policy, the Minister rightly did a deal with Cork Airport that it would not be shouldered with any debt associated with the building of a new terminal.  It was stated that the new Dublin Airport Authority would pay for it and, in order to compensate it for this decision, it was given the asset base of the Great Southern Hotels group and Aer Rianta International.  It was a simple deal that made sense for everybody.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since the decision, circumstances have changed.  Now that the deal is done and is more or less irreversible, the Dublin Airport Authority has successfully lobbied the Government to change its view and break the deal.  There seems to be a tendency to blame the former Minister for <Col N="208"/>Transport for this U-turn.  The implication is that replacing a former Minister with a new Minister requires a new policy.  That is rubbish.  The decision was made by the Government, including the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">As I said last week, it is the Minister&rsquo;s view that both Cork and Shannon have an excellent future with this debt-free start.  He brought this view to Government last week and the Government agreed with him.  The new boards at the independent airports in Cork and Shannon will provide dynamic futures for those regions and it was on that basis that the decisions were made.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This is clear.  The Taoiseach then went to Cork Airport and personally reassured staff there that the new airport, when built, would be a competitive airport that could commence business without having to carry any debt.  More than one or two staff told this to me.  They were told it would be debt-free because it would be challenging to compete with the huge bases of Dublin and Shannon airports.</P>
        <P>The deal was done and it was fair to all.  It was convenient at the time because it got the political deal done.  Now circumstances have changed and, on foot of the troubles and the plans to develop Dublin Airport, the Government&rsquo;s plans have changed.  It has decided to lumber Cork Airport with a debt it cannot afford to finance.  This represents the most blatant broken political promise in the lifetime of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Cork Airport is very small compared to Dublin Airport and deserves a chance to commence and build a business debt-free.  Even if it is debt-free, the challenge will be great.  By lumbering it with a debt of &euro;100 million, it will be almost impossible for it to do business.  Will the Minister outline how he expects the airport to service the debt?</P>
        <P>The airport needs to develop further and it is not yet finished.  If it is to be on its own, how will it build up the assets it requires?  I fear the debt will hurt the airport.  The only solution I see for it is to increase charges but if it does so, the airlines will do less business with it.  They have told us this.  It is already almost always more expensive to fly from Cork to London than from Dublin to London.  I have checked this many times.  Cork Airport is already under pressure and this decision will kill it.  It will make it almost impossible to do business not only in the city, but also in the whole region.  Tourism will suffer if airlines are not flying to the airport.</P>
        <P>I do not know what can be done as it seems the decision has already been made.  It took two and half years from when the Minister entered office to make any decision on this matter.  There was prevarication and shuffling and when a decision was finally made, it was bad.  It is what we and business people in Cork city and the wider region feared.  The last thing we want is for Cork Airport <Col N="209"/>to suffer.  We hope it can get through this but I fear it will not be able to do so.  Businesses in Cork have already gone to the wall and this decision will not help.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the comments made by the Opposition represent the type of politics that leaves a very sour taste in my mouth and a sense of despair over the level to which politics has descended among some people, particularly members of the Opposition, in that they would wilfully undermine a substantial national asset, not just an asset of their own region, to put forward a political agenda.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The State Airports Act 2004 provides the framework for the establishment of Shannon and Cork Airports as independent airports.  As part of the airport restructuring process, the boards of Cork and Shannon Airports are required to prepare business plans for eventual separation.  That is their remit, not mine.  In the first instance, all three airports&rsquo; business plans must be co-ordinated by the Dublin Airport Authority for eventual approval by the Ministers for Transport and Finance.  Both Ministers must be satisfied that the airports have the capacity to operate on a sound commercial basis before giving final approval to the business plans.</P>
        <P>The requirements to be satisfied in advance of separation and in particular the need to ensure the financial sustainability of all three State airports were made clear by my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Brennan, in this House when the State Airports Bill was debated in 2004.  During the debate in the Seanad, it was stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . Aer Rianta will be able to make the transfers only when it has available distributable reserves equal to the net value of the assets transferred.  [This is company law although some want to ignore it.]  As the distributable reserves available to Aer Rianta are insufficient for this purpose, a phased approach is provided for in the Bill which will allow for one of the new airport authorities to be vested relatively soon after enactment, namely Shannon Airport, while the second will be vested once sufficient further distributable reserves have been built up within Aer Rianta, namely Cork Airport.  A portion of the Cork Airport assets will remain in Aer Rianta and <Col N="210"/>will be subject to a finance lease between Aer Rianta and the Cork Airport Authority.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is simple, plain English.  There is consistency between the policy then and the one enunciated by me now.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty if the Cork Airport Authority wants to wait until the distributable reserves of the Dublin Airport Authority are fully available, and Cork Airport would be handed over debt-free.  I have always stated this position and have been utterly consistent.  Alternatively, if the board wants to progress the separation immediately &mdash; I believe this is the right business decision for Cork Airport &mdash; it will have to accept that a portion of the debt will to have to be put in place through some form of financial mechanism to receive full autonomy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The promise was otherwise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The distributable reserves needed to comply with all elements of company law, with which the Deputy should be more than familiar&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was the promise made by the Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;will not be available and are not at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The promise was made by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fulfilling that promise utterly.  If Cork Airport Authority wants to wait until the distributable reserves of the Dublin Airport Authority are available&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We want the airport to be debt-free.  That is what was promised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The irony is that Dublin Airport is quite happy to keep Cork Airport.  The deal is disastrous from the Dublin Airport Authority&rsquo;s point of view.  It is giving away one of the most valuable assets in its group while having to sell off and maximise all the others.  It would want to keep Cork Airport within its remit because it is a very successful airport and makes a very substantial contribution.  This would involve Dublin Airport bearing all the debts.</P>
        <P>It is ironic that Dublin Airport tells me I am giving the airport away and that it is happy to keep it, given the astonishing comments made by some in the Opposition about the inability of Cork Airport to be viable.  Small regional airports have millions of euro in debts, yet according to some Opposition Deputies, an international airport such as Cork is unable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister deny that a promise was made?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="211"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fully supportive of Cork Airport&rsquo;s wish for autonomy earlier than originally planned and the need to operate effectively and commercially to serve the needs of tourism, trade and travel in its hinterland.  A financial mechanism will have to be found so that Cork Airport can shoulder a reasonable share of the debt burden associated with the assets transferred to it.  Any resolution of the debt issue will have to ensure that the debt burden is manageable for Cork and can form a reasonable basis for Cork Airport&rsquo;s autonomy without putting at risk its commercial future.  In making the arrangements for the creation of an independent Cork Airport, these and other challenges relevant to each airport will have to be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A significant opportunity now exists for Cork Airport to achieve the autonomy that the region needs and desires.  I believe that autonomy can proceed quickly, provided the Cork Airport board can agree a realistic business plan that includes an appropriate financial mechanism for the transfer of substantial assets to the Cork Airport Authority on vesting.  I therefore urge all concerned to seize the opportunity for autonomy by recognising that such a financial mechanism is <Col N="212"/>essential to make the independence of Cork Airport a reality at an early date.</P>
        <P>As to the reference to commercial development of certain lands at Cork Airport, I understand expressions of interest have been sought by the DAA concerning the potential use of such land in a joint venture with the private sector.  As far as the Government and I are concerned, there is no question of such land being treated differently from other assets being transferred to the Cork Airport Authority on its vesting.</P>
        <P>Cork airport has a choice to make.  It can either go all out for early separation and, accordingly, make a suitable contribution to the debt attributable to its assets or it can see the restructuring delayed until the funding and reserves position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>In December 2006, following opposition from Congress, the US authorities withdrew the rule making proposal concerning control and ownership of U.S. airlines.  The rule making provision had been a key demand for a number of Member States and its withdrawal by the US side is a significant barrier to concluding the EU US Open Skies agreement.</P>
        <P>Negotiation at EU-US level resumed in January 2007, with both sides reaffirming their commitment to the goal of concluding an EU-US agreement that would open access to markets and maximise benefits on both sides of the Atlantic.  Following negotiations in Washington earlier this <Col N="214"/>month a further round is scheduled for next week. The objective is to reach agreement in time for the next Transport Council in March 2007.</P>
        <P>I am following the negotiations between the EU and US closely and my Department is in ongoing contact with the Office of the Attorney General on the legal options.  As I indicated previously, in the absence of progress at EU level, I intend to seek to implement, in accordance with Community law, measures to provide for liberalisation of transatlantic services between Ireland and the US by way of an amendment to the Ireland-US bilateral Air Services Agreement.</P>

It is anticipated that the new legislation will address a range of issues including the introduction of a single licensing code for all bus operators. The legislation will also be designed in a manner consistent with EU law on public service obligations and State Aids and in such a way to create new opportunities and a level playing field for private operator involvement in the bus market.</P>
        <P>There has been no delay in drafting the legislation.

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 112 and 167 together.</P>
        <P>In relation to driver disqualification a framework for the mutual recognition of disqualifications is contained in the European Union Convention on Driving Disqualifications (98/C 216/01). The Convention relates to disqualifications arising from a range of specified traffic <Col N="217"/>offences including drink-driving, speeding and dangerous driving. Irish legislation to support the application of the Convention is contained in the Road Traffic Act, 2002.</P>
        <P>In advance of the Convention fully coming into force and following a Ministerial meeting of the Transport Sectoral Group of the British-Irish Council on 9 February 2006, I have formally agreed with the UK Minister of State for Transport to enter into bilateral arrangements on the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications as envisaged in the EU Convention.</P>
        <P>The UK Minister for State for Transport wrote to me recently advising me that it is now likely to be later than the first half of 2007 when the UK and NI authorities will have the necessary legislative and consultative processes complete to enable mutual recognition to be put in place. Officials continue to work to ensure that the necessary administrative arrangements are in place to enable relevant administrations to recognise and take action on driving disqualifications occurring in the other jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>In relation to lesser offences, the North South Work Programme, as agreed by the North South Ministerial Council, included a commitment to examine the mutual recognition of penalty points between the Republic of Ireland and the North.  However, in addition to the fact that separate penalty point systems operate in the two jurisdictions on this island, the system that operates in Northern Ireland differs from that applying in Great Britain.  For that reason, it was agreed that it would be more appropriate to pursue the question of mutual recognition of penalty points on the basis of the operation of the three systems and that it would also be more appropriate that it would be dealt with under the auspices of the British-Irish Council.</P>
        <P>As Northern Ireland has the lead role for transport matters in the BIC, the authorities in that jurisdiction are taking the lead in considering this issue. It was agreed at the British-Irish Council meeting on the 9 February 2006 that officials should examine the prospects for greater co-operation in the treatment of road traffic infringements where the penalty falls short of disqualification. Arising from work in this area I have agreed with the UK Minister for State for Transport the terms of reference proposed for a study of the feasibility of greater cooperation between us in relation to lesser road traffic infringements with a view to our officials undertaking a study on this basis. Work on this study is ongoing.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 187 together.</P>
        <P>To date c. &euro;14.5 million of grant aid has been paid to approved projects under the Seaports Measure of the previous NDP 2000-2006, following a competitive call for proposals. Further funding is still available in 2007 for eligible expenditure related to the approved projects.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s Ports Policy Statement published in January 2005 makes clear that the State-owned commercial port companies should in future fund their operations and infrastructural requirements without recourse to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>In line with this policy, Exchequer funding of port infrastructure is not envisaged under the new NDP 2007-2013. In relation to non-Exchequer expenditure under the NDP 2007-2013 it has been estimated that projects at the main commercial ports will cost between &euro;300 million and &euro;600 million.</P>
        <P>The precise projects, their timing, and expenditure will be decided by the port companies and their boards, subject to the required capital appraisal and statutory ministerial approvals.</P>
        <P>In addition, investment will take place at certain regional harbours. Current policy is that these harbour authorities would best achieve their potential through transfer to local authority or port company control. As part of the transfer arrangements, a programme of remedial works will continue to be funded as appropriate under the NDP.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91, 122 and 129 together.</P>
        <P>At the outset, I should explain that overall responsibility for the planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects, including the M50 upgrade, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) and the local authorities concerned.  I have no function in relation to the day-to-day operation of these projects.</P>
        <P>In addition, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads, including the M50, is vested in the National Roads Authority (NRA) under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000).</P>
        <P>Yesterday I informed the Government about progress in the discussions between the National Roads Authority (NRA) and National Toll Roads (NTR) regarding the termination of NTR&rsquo;s involvement on the West Link Bridge.  I indicated to the Government the broad terms on which the NRA is now intending to close a deal with National Toll Roads.  These terms are that NTR&rsquo;s involvement with the West Link facility will cease as from mid-2008.  NTR will receive annual payments of &euro;50 million, plus Consumer Price Index, for each of the years 2008-2020.</P>
        <P>The upgrade work on the M50 is being undertaken in three phases.  Phase 1 comprises the widening of the carriageway between the N4 (Galway Road roundabout) and Ballymount interchanges and the upgrading of the N4, N7 and Ballymount interchanges.  This work is currently under way and is expected to be completed in mid-2008.</P>
        <P>Phase 2 which is being administered as a Public Private Partnership project will comprise of the <Col N="220"/>widening of 24km of the M50 from south of the M1/M50 Turnapin interchange to the N3 interchange and from south of Ballymount interchange to the Sandyford interchange including the upgrade of the other interchanges along these sections.  The contract for Phase 2 is to be awarded in 2007 and construction is expected to be completed in 2010.</P>
        <P>Phase 3 comprises the widening of the section between south of the N3 interchange and north of the West Link toll plaza which is expected to be completed by mid 2008.</P>
        <P>Separately the NRA are procuring the replacement of the current West Link toll plaza with single point barrier free tolling.  It is intended that this will be introduced during 2008 in tandem with the completion of phase 1 of the M50 upgrade.</P>
        <P>I expect, therefore, that significant improvements in the situation on the M50 will take place in 2008.   Further improvement will take place on completion of the later phases of the upgrade in 2010.  In the meantime, traffic management in the area is being monitored on an ongoing basis with measures being taken where possible to alleviate traffic congestion resulting from the road works.</P>
        <P>I understand that the toll revenue from the barrier-free single point toll will be used to fund Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the M50 upgrade and the cost of introducing barrier free tolling as well as the costs of terminating NTR&rsquo;s West-Link contract.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Kildare Route Project involves doubling the number of tracks to four, with two dedicated lines for commuter services and two dedicated lines for Intercity and regional services.  This will facilitate a major upgrade of InterCity services, long distance commuter services and local commuter services on the corridor.  These services will be operated with diesel powered trains.</P>
        <P>The additional tracks will enable increased train frequencies serving Sallins, Newbridge and Kildare in the peak periods, with improved journey times because these services will not be required to call at local stations between Hazelhatch and Heuston.</P><Col N="221"/>
        <P>In the longer term it is proposed to electrify the route to enable electric train commuter services through to the city centre via an interconnector tunnel.  The Interconnector is intended to be the final phase of a programme to extend and reconfigure the DART and suburban services and to provide higher capacities, frequencies and integration of services to meet forecast demand levels in the Dublin area and to develop an integrated transport system for the capital.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 174 and 267 together.</P>
        <P>The popularity of the existing Luas network continued to grow in 2006 with an increase of 16% in passenger carryings compared to 2005.  Last year, Luas carried 25.8 million passengers of which 13.7 million travelled on the Red line and 12.1 million on the Green line.</P>
        <P>The success of Luas has already demonstrated that light rail is an essential and popular component of the public transport infrastructure for Dublin and over the coming years, the Luas and Metro elements of Transport 21 will bring the <Col N="227"/>benefits of this modern and efficient mode of urban transport to a much wider commuter base.</P>
        <P>To cater for the higher demand, the RPA increased the peak-time frequency on the Green line last year from 5 to 4 minutes and instituted a special shuttle service on the Red line between Heuston and Connolly Stations.  In addition, the RPA is in the process of providing a 40% increase in capacity on the Red line by increasing the length of the 26 trams from 30 metres to 40 metres.  The first of the new extended trams will enter service in May 2007 and the tram extensions will be completed in 2008.</P>
        <P>In addition, for the medium-term, my Department recently gave approval to the RPA to purchase eight trams for use on the existing Luas network and it is expected that these additional trams will be in service by the end of 2009.</P>

	<P>I approved an average increase in fare revenue of 2.75%. Subject to this, it was a matter for the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) to determine the details of the new Luas fares structure which it announced on 4th January last.</P>
        <P>I understand from the RPA that the reason for the introduction of the modest differential prices between peak and off-peak single tickets was to encourage passengers to transfer to the better value and more convenient options of SmartCards and Travelcards. The Agency expects that <Col N="228"/>this will contribute to reducing queues at Luas ticket machines in the morning and evening peaks which, due to the high frequency of Luas, can lead to people missing trams. Passengers who use a SmartCard or a Travelcard need to visit ticket machines less frequently which contributes to shorter queues.</P>
        <P>The RPA believes that this peak/off-peak pricing should have no effect on the vast majority of passengers who travel in the peak period as the RPA offers a suite of ticket options and the single ticket is only suited to the very occasional traveller.</P>
        <P>Luas SmartCard fares and child fares were not increased for the second year running. SmartCard users can avail of average savings of up to 15% compared to single ticket purchases.</P>

	<P>The issue of a second airport for the Dublin region was addressed in the Warburg Dillon Read Report of 1999 on Aer Rianta.  Among other things, that report concluded that Dublin does not need a second airport given Dublin Airport&rsquo;s capacity to expand for the foreseeable future. I am satisfied that the analysis remains a valid assessment of the Airport&rsquo;s potential. Because of the prudent policy of acquiring land banks in the environs of the airport to cater for future growth, the Dublin Airport Authority is now in the happy position of being able to construct the proposed second runway and the second terminal on land it already owns.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s objective with regard to aviation policy is to facilitate and encourage a wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive commercial air services for Irish tourism, trade and industry.  In furtherance of this policy, the Government has taken a number of key strategic decisions in recent years.</P>
        <P>With specific reference to Dublin Airport, the Government decided that the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) should proceed with the development of a new terminal and associated infrastructural works to be put in place by 2009.</P>
        <P>Under its Capital Investment Programme, the DAA have embarked on the development of Terminal Two and the associated pier facilities to be constructed close to the existing terminal. Fingal County Council granted planning permission for the project in October 2006 and this is now under appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. I am assured that the DAA is working to the Government deadline to have the terminal operational by 2009. In addition, Pier D is currently under construction and it is hoped to have this completed by the end of this year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Finally, the DAA is at the planning stages for the construction of a second runway which will provide for significant additional capacity at the airport. Taking into account all these major capacity improvements, my view is that Dublin Airport will not reach full capacity for many years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the question of congestion at the airport, the DAA are confident that the recent decision of the Commission for Aviation Regulation to designate Dublin Airport as a <Col N="230"/>coordinated airport for the summer of 2007 will help reduce congestion during peak hours.</P>
        <P>In addition, I understand that the company will put in place a number of capacity enhancement projects for the 2007 summer season which are expected to improve the efficiency of access to, and within, the airport.  From the point of view of civil aviation policy generally, my view is that Dublin Airport has considerable scope to expand to cater for growth in air traffic for many years to come and accordingly Dublin does not need a second airport. Indeed the national spatial strategy has acknowledged that the expansion of the level of air services from Dublin Airport to a wider range of destinations is essential in the interests of underpinning Ireland&rsquo;s future international competitiveness.</P>
        <P>With regard to the role of Aer Lingus and other carriers, I am firmly of the view that Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests are best served by having as many airlines as possible competing vigorously and seeking to exploit all possible opportunities for new services.</P>
        <P>My Departmental officials and I have regular meetings with all relevant aviation stakeholders, including the DAA, with regard to the implementation of Government policy for State Airports and for aviation matters generally.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The main contributory factors in road traffic fatalities are speeding, drink-driving and the non wearing of seat belts. The influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern and has thus been given recognition in the previous Government Strategy on Road Safety.</P>
        <P>Identification of the presence of drugs is however more complex than for alcohol.  Consequently, considerably more work is needed to develop a more detailed regulatory regime in relation to drugs and driving. It is illegal to drive while under the influence of drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of a vehicle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Road Traffic Acts provide that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may, where he or she is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, require that person to go to a Garda station and further require that person submit to a blood test or to provide a urine sample.</P><Col N="231"/>
        <P>The Medical Bureau of Road Safety (MBRS) analyses blood and urine specimens received under the Road Traffic Acts for the presence of a drug or drugs.  In 2005, 747 specimens were tested for the presence of a drug or drugs. 484 specimens tested positive and 262 were found to be negative for the presence of a drug or drugs.</P>
        <P>There is no feasible basis yet in Ireland or in Europe for the introduction of a scheme of preliminary roadside testing for drugs. Testing devices are still in the prototype stages.</P>
        <P>At a meeting of the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in July 2006, representatives from all over Europe addressed the issue of random drug testing of drivers at the roadside in the light of the most up to date developments throughout this region.</P>
        <P>The MBRS and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na participated in that seminar, which concluded that there is currently no device considered to be reliable enough in order to be recommended for roadside saliva screening of drivers for drugs.  The Medical Bureau is keeping abreast of developments in this area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions 115 and 186 together.</P>
        <P>The Integrated Ticketing Project Board has prepared a roadmap for the implementation of integrated ticketing within the Dublin area, based on smartcard technology.  Subject to the approval of the approach by the respective Boards of the transport operators, the Integrated Ticketing Project Board will proceed to the next phase of the project which is to go to public procurement.  The Integrated Ticketing Project Board will revert to me before it enters into any contractual arrangements to procure a contractor to build the integrated ticketing system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the interim, there are in place a range of integrated tickets, based on magnetic stripe technology, that allow transfers between Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Luas and Irish Rail. There are also integrated tickets available between Luas and the private bus operator, Morton&rsquo;s Coaches. Details of these are available from the operators.

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed that Metro North will be procured as a public private partnership (PPP) with the cost of the construction and maintenance borne by the private consortium selected through a tendering process.  The PPP consortium will be paid through annual Exchequer payments over a period of approximately 26 years, which will start after commencement of services. The level of payment will be dependent on the consortium meeting service delivery standards set out in the PPP contract.</P>
        <P>I have continually stated that I am not in a position to release details of the costs for Metro North in advance of the public procurement process. These details remain commercially sensitive in order to protect public funds and achieve best value for money; revealing the amount that the State is willing to pay for a service may give tenderers an opportunity to increase their asking price above what they might otherwise seek.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency is the body responsible for developing the design of the metro.  All of the route options identified by the RPA were evaluated by it against criteria which included cost and a range of other factors such as feasibility, likely patronage, environmental impact, integration, land use, safety, efficiency and journey time.</P>
        <P>The RPA will in due course submit an application for a Railway Order to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and it will then be a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to come to consider and decide on that application.</P>

        <P>The Road Traffic Act 2006 was passed by the Oireachtas on 6th July 2006 and was signed by the President on 16th July 2006.  A Commencement Order in July brought a number of the provisions in the Act into effect from Friday 21st July 2006.</P>
        <P>The provisions commenced included the key policy provisions of Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) checkpoints, a ban on the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving, and the legislative provision supporting the operation of privately operated speed cameras.  These policy initiatives were commenced without delay, and approximately 30,000 Mandatory Alcohol Tests are being conducted by the Garda&iacute; every month.  In addition, Section 16 of the Act was part-commenced with effect from 1 September 2006 in order to enable penalty points to apply to the offence of driving while holding a mobile phone. The question of reducing the existing 80mg limit will be kept under review.</P>
        <P>Section 5 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 provides for the introduction of a fixed charge and disqualification for certain drink driving offences. The implementation of that section requires administrative and enforcement preparations, including adjustments to the Garda Fixed Charge Processing and IT systems and the testing of those systems.  Work is progressing on these matters and my officials are liaising with their counterparts in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda&iacute; to complete their work as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 36 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, as amended by of the Road Traffic Acts 2004 and 2006, provides for a system of automatic disqualification from applying for or holding a small public service vehicle driver or vehicle licence in respect of per<Col N="234"/>sons who have been convicted of certain specified offences.  These include the offences of murder, manslaughter and various sexual, drug trafficking and other offences.</P>
        <P>As a first step in giving full effect to the provisions of section 36 as amended, I made an order commencing subsections 2(A), 3, 3(A) and 4 of the section with effect from 25 May 2006. This has been done in consultation with the Commission for Taxi Regulation, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service, my Department and the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>The measures in these subsections allow existing licence holders or licence applicants who have been convicted of specified offences to apply to the Courts to be allowed to apply for a licence under such terms and conditions as the court may direct. This allows such individuals to clarify their situation in advance of the full commencement of the section.</P>
        <P>Further consultation and discussion will be required with the Commission for Taxi Regulation and others before a decision is taken to commence in full the provisions of section 36 of the 2003 Act, as amended. In any event an appropriate period of advance notice of the proposed commencement of the section is envisaged to allow persons who may be affected by the provision, in particular existing licence holders, to clarify their position with the courts if, at that stage, they have not already done so.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 148 together.</P>
        <P>The Government has not failed to honour its commitment in relation to the provision of additional buses in the Dublin area over the period of the last NDP.  Over that period, Dublin Bus purchased a total of 730 new buses, 517 replacement and 213 additional.  This compares to an NDP forecast of 500 replacement and 275 additional.  The capacity of the Dublin Bus fleet, taking into account the 100 additional buses recently purchased is now over 106,000 &mdash; an increase of more than 34% on the 2000 capacity. The position regarding the 100 additional buses for which I approved funding of &euro;30 million in September last is that all of the buses have been delivered and are entering into service as commissioning is completed.  The deployment of the buses is a matter for Dublin Bus but I understand that buses have been introduced in Tallaght (Route 54A), Cherrywood  (Routes 145 and 84X) and Tyrrellstown, north of Blanchardstown <Col N="237"/>(Route 40D).  Dublin Bus propose to operate the remainder of the buses across all sectors of the bus network concentrating on new developing areas, existing and new Quality Bus Corridors and on routes that have high levels of demand for buses.</P>

	<P>Commuter and suburban rail services in the Dublin area and adjoining counties have been improved substantially in recent years. Major upgrade pro<Col N="240"/>jects such as the DART Upgrade project, the redevelopment of Heuston Station, the introduction of new rolling stock, the upgrade of the Kildare line through the provision of turnback facilities at Newbridge and the extension of platforms and the doubling of the track between Maynooth and Clonsilla have delivered major increases in the frequency and capacity of services. Peak hour DART capacity has nearly doubled from 14,000 in 2000. Capacity on the Kildare and Maynooth lines has been increased by 160% and 200% respectively in recent years.</P>
        <P>The completion of major projects provided for under Transport 21 such as the Docklands Station, the Kildare Route Upgrade project, the Navan Rail link, city centre resignalling, the introduction of further new rolling stock in the early years of Transport 21 and, by 2015, the completion of the interconnector and electrification projects will further enhance commuter and suburban rail services.</P>
        <P>In the meantime Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will continue to implement service improvements such as the recent introduction of Sunday commuter services on the Kildare line, the improvement of peak hour commuter service frequencies on the Maynooth line and the upgrade of station car parking.</P>

My Department is working with CIE to establish how these targets can be achieved in the shortest time frame possible.</P>

In May 2006 Dublin Bus announced that it would use bio-diesel made from RVO on a trial basis in five open-top tour buses, which have been operating without any technical difficulties.</P>

	<P>The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) began a public consultation on five potential routes for connecting the two existing Luas lines in November 2005 with five possible route options, A to E. During public consultation a new option, F, was identified.</P>
        <P>Options A and F have emerged as the better options and RPA launched a second phase of public consultation in January 2007 involving an open-day, display days, newspaper notices and distribution of newsletters focusing on the selection of the best of these two route options. The deadline for comments, which should be submitted to RPA, is Friday, 9 March 2007.  I also understand that the RPA has engaged in dialogue with Dublin City Council, Dublin Bus and the Dublin Transportation Office in relation to the implications of the potential routes for bus services and other road users.</P>
        <P>The construction timescale will be dependent on the route chosen following the public consultation and the discussions with stakeholders and on the outcome of the statutory approval process.  A second stage of this project will extend the line to Liffey Junction via Grangegorman and Broadstone.

        <P>As Deputies will be aware, in January of last year, the NRA decided to replace the West-Link toll on the M50 by a single-point barrier free toll on the same stretch of motorway in 2008. The installation of barrier free tolling is a crucial element of the M50 upgrade which is underway at present. In that context, following a tender competition, the NRA have recently entered into a contract for the provision of single point barrier free tolling arrangements with the objective of having such arrangements operational on the M50 by mid 2008.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan on Accessible Transport in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act 2005, &lsquo;Transport Access for All&rsquo; addresses the accessibility needs of people with mobility, sensory and cognitive impairments across all transport modes and contains time bound targets for the progressive realisation of accessible transport in Ireland.</P>
        <P>A number of measures to achieve the implementation of &lsquo;Transport Access for All&rsquo; have already been put in place, including the provision of funding under Transport 21 and the extension of the remit of the Public Transport Accessibility Committee (PTAC) to incorporate a monitoring role.</P>
        <P>Since the year 2000 good progress has been made across a number of fronts. For example, all new buses purchased by the CIE companies for urban services are now low floor and wheelchair accessible. Similarly in the rail sector all new rail rolling stock is specified to full accessibility standards. Good progress has also been made by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Eacute;ireann in upgrading their respective stations to cater for the needs of people with mobility, sensory and cognitive impairments. This work is continuing. Also, Luas has been designed from the outset to be a fully accessible system and the proposed new Luas and Metro services will incorporate the most up-to-date accessibility provisions.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Taxi Regulation is also advancing measures to aid people with mobility, sensory and cognitive impairments.  Each of the CIE operating companies, the Dublin Airport Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency/Veolia Transport have established disability users groups to advise them on accessibility matters at the company level.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan contains a number of provisions to facilitate the monitoring of progress on its implementation. These include the incorporation of progress reports in the Department&rsquo;s annual reports as well as participation in interdepartmental co-ordinating and monitoring structures for the National Disability Strategy. In addition, each agency under the aegis of my Department is required to provide in their annual reports a progress report on the imple<Col N="244"/>mentation of the relevant sections of the Sectoral Plan.</P>

	<P>The Road Traffic Act 2006 was passed by the Oireachtas on 6th July 2006 and was signed by the President on 16th July 2006.  I signed a Commencement Order in July which brought a number of the provisions in the Act into effect from Friday 21st July 2006.</P>
        <P>The key policy initiatives set out in the Act were commenced without delay including Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) checkpoints, a ban on the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving, and the legislative provision supporting the operation of privately operated speed cameras.</P>
        <P>In addition, Section 16 of the Act was part-commenced with effect from 1 September 2006 in order to enable penalty points to apply to the offence of driving while holding a mobile phone.</P>
        <P>Section 5 of the Act provides for the introduction of a fixed charge and disqualification for certain drink driving offences.  This was not commenced immediately, pending the necessary administrative and enforcement preparations, which are now in hand.  Neither section 5 nor the remainder of section 16 can be commenced until such time as the administrative and enforcement procedures are in place.  Both sections require adjustments to the Garda Fixed Charge Processing and IT systems and in this context, it is proposed to commence these sections as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>A number of sections in the Act relate to the imposition of disqualification orders and fines by the courts.  I intend to commence these provisions very shortly.</P>

	<P>This is an operational matter for the bus companies con<Col N="245"/>cerned.  Significant progress has been made in recent years in the introduction of wheelchair accessible buses by both Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Since 2000 all buses purchased for urban services are low floor, wheelchair accessible.  I understand from Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath that currently 58% of the fleet is accessible and that the company plans to have all of the fleet accessible by 2012. I also understand from Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath that all of the Dublin major public hospitals are served by at least one route on which all of its vehicles are fully accessible.  I also understand that Bus &Eacute;ireann has already achieved almost 100% fleet conversion to fully accessible buses on its urban services in the major regional cites.</P>

	<P>While journey times are important, the key issues in relation to railway services from a user&rsquo;s point of view are frequency, reliability and punctuality.  I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that railway services have improved significantly under all of these headings in recent years.</P>
        <P>The growth in the number of passengers using the railway service from 29.41 million in 1997 to 43.15 million in 2006 &mdash; an increase of 46.7% &mdash; reflects the increase in frequency of the rail services and their improved punctuality record.</P>
        <P>This improvement in rail services is due to the major Exchequer investment in the upgrade of the railway network in recent years.  Since 1999 over &euro;1.6 billion has been invested in upgrading the railway infrastructure and rolling stock.  The pace and momentum of the upgrade programme is being maintained under Transport 21 and &euro;395 million has been allocated this year to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for upgrade works.</P>
        <P>This investment has enabled Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to increase capacity and the number of services throughout the country.  For example, on the Dublin-Cork Intercity service  frequency  has been doubled to provide an hourly service in both directions throughout the day.  On the Dublin-Sligo line, service frequency between Sligo and Dublin has increased by over 60%.  Service punctuality is also at a high level with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann <Col N="246"/>consistently achieving its punctuality targets and more than 90% of its trains arriving on time.</P>
        <P>In relation to journey times, I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that most InterCity point to point journey times have been maintained in recent years despite a significant increase in the number of trains operating on the network.  Also, substantial infrastructure works are being carried out whilst still keeping services operating reliably.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue raised by the Deputy is a day-to-day operational matter for the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), in which I have no statutory function.  However, I understand from the DAA that the company will use slot coordination and operational planning to reduce congestion at Dublin Airport during the 2007 high season.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation announced its decision on 12 <Col N="247"/>February last to designate Dublin Airport as a coordinated airport for the Summer 2007 season and the DAA are confident that this will help reduce congestion during peak hours. Under this process an independent coordinator will allocate take off and landing slots at the airport, up to but not exceeding the agreed operating capacity limits. In common with other coordinated airports, airlines will have no discretion but to accede to the slots allocated by the independent coordinator.</P>
        <P>In addition the company has informed me of a number of capacity enhancement projects that are planned for the 2007 summer season. These include: the opening of a new check-in area (area 14) to provide an additional 25 check-in desks and the arrivals roadway is being altered to facilitate additional passenger access to this area; additional security points at the security search area to increase the processing capability; additional customer service staff will be provided; and a new coach park has been built providing direct access to the arrivals and access to the departures area by way of a travelator.</P>

	<P>The planning and design of the Navan Rail Link is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in the first instance.  I understand that the old Navan rail line will be re-opened in two phases with the first phase running off the Maynooth line, at Clonsilla, to the M3 interchange at Pace, near Dunboyne.  I am informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that design work is underway on this phase.

        <P>Under Phase 2 it is proposed to extend the rail line to Navan within the period of Transport 21.  I am advised by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that a scoping study is underway looking at route options for Phase 2 between Dunboyne and Navan.  This study commenced in January 2007 and will examine a number of route options and assess the physical and financial viability of reopening the section to Navan.  I understand from Irish Rail that this scoping study will be complete in August 2007.</P>

	<P>Regulation (EC) No. 2320/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security has been in force since January 2003. This Regulation and a number of implementing regulations adopted subsequently have been adopted into our National Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP).  A common position of the Transport Council on a Regulation to replace Regulation 2320/2002 was adopted on 11 December 2006 and is currently before the European Parliament for a second reading. The proposed new Regulation sets out to clarify, simplify and further harmonise requirements in relation to civil aviation security with the objective of enhancing overall levels of security.</P>

Physical renewal of the track and signalling and the upgrading of level crossings will commence in mid year.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann expects that work should be completed on Phase 1 by end of 2008.

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions 171 and 254 together.</P>
        <P>In December 2006, the ESRI published, as part of its Winter 2006 Quarterly Economic Commentary, an article entitled Evaluation Transport 21.  While I welcome any constructive assessment of Transport 21, I do not accept the analysis in that article.  Transport 21 provides unprecedented capital investment for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s transport system over the period to 2015. This investment will transform both the national road and public transport networks in the country. The investment programme being funded by Transport 21 is based on an extensive and robust body of research, analysis and policy work over a period of years and the projects identified for development are consistent with the results of that work.</P>
        <P>The DTO&rsquo;s A Platform for Change provides the basis for the proposed investment in Dublin and this was subject to an independent economic evaluation, which is reported in the document itself. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann carried out and appraisal of its Greater Dublin Integrated Rail Network Plan and this was reviewed by independent consultants and found to be robust. A full appraisal was also undertaken of the Strategic Rail Review by the independent consultants that prepared it and the proposed national roads investment was informed by the Roads Needs Study.</P>
        <P>Each project in Transport 21 will be evaluated in strict accordance with the Department of Finance Capital Appraisal Guidelines and Value for Money criteria. They will also have to go through the necessary statutory approval processes, which, for most projects, will mean a public hearing before an inspector where the case for the project, including the business case, will have to be clearly set out. Indeed, I have gone further than Department of Finance Guidelines require in that my Department has commissioned independent consultancy reviews of the business cases for a number of major public transport projects presented by its agencies.</P>
        <P>In addition, I have established a Monitoring Group, comprising representatives of a number of Government Departments, to oversee progress on Transport 21. The Group will satisfy itself that <Col N="254"/>proper procedures are being followed in the appraisal, management and post project review of projects. In this regard, an independent audit is being put in place, which, among other things, will review how the implementing agencies are appraising projects, so as to satisfy Government of the robustness of these evaluation processes and their consistency with the Department of Finance Guidelines.</P>
        <P>Already, the country is beginning to see the benefits of the significant investment that has been made in transport infrastructure over the past few years. The major inter-urban roads programme is on target for completion in 2010, with about 67% of the network either open to traffic or under construction. Most of the roads projects completed last year were delivered ahead of or on time and under budget. Our railways are also witnessing significant increases in passenger numbers, with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s carryings at a record high of over 43 million journeys and Luas carrying almost 26 million in 2006. I expect further significant progress in 2007.</P>
        <P>The unprecedented funding provided in Transport 21 is needed now to develop a modern transport infrastructure that the country requires for its future economic prosperity. I am glad that the Government has re-affirmed its commitment to Transport 21 by including all of the projects for the period 2007 to 2013 in the National Development Plan.</P>

	<P>Both Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann have projected future demand for bus services as a basis for their development plans.  The Dublin Bus Network review identified a requirement for an additional 325 buses in the period to 2011 to meet projected demand of over 180 million passengers per annum in the Dublin area.  Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s regional development plans project a requirement for over 360 new buses, including 200 additional buses to meet anticipated increased demand in provincial city and commuter services. Interurban Expressway commercial services are funded from within the companies own resources.</P><Col N="256"/>
        <P>In recognition of the critical role of bus services in meeting these transport needs, Transport 21 provides for substantial ongoing investment in bus services in Dublin and throughout the country.  In this context, I approved funding of &euro;80 million in September last for the purchase of 100 additional buses and 160 new buses by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann respectively.  I have also allocated a further &euro;15 million to Dublin Bus towards the cost of purchasing 100 replacement buses in 2007.  The 100 additional buses in the Dublin area are now entering service and Bus &Eacute;ireann are in the process of procuring the 160 new buses.  Separately the companies and private operators are funding commercial services from their own resources.</P>
        <P>The need for additional buses, over and above those referred to above, will be dealt with in the context of the proposals for legislation, which are currently being prepared, for the replacement of the Road Transport Act, 1932.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 250 together.</P>
        <P>EU Directive No. 2002/15 is concerned with the organisation of working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities and supplements the existing drivers&rsquo; hours legislation as provided for in EU Regulation 3820/85 &mdash; soon to be replaced by a new Regulation No. 561/2006 on the harmonization of certain social legislation relating to road transport.  The provisions of the drivers&rsquo; hours regulations takes precedence over the Working Time Directive in relation to driving activities.</P>
        <P>Regulation No. 561/2006 applies to all EU Member States and comes into force from 11th April 2007 with the exception of certain provisions that came into effect from 1 May 2006.  The overall objective of the new legislation is to improve working conditions for drivers and road safety. These new rules will replace the existing drivers&rsquo; hours rules which have not been updated since 1985. As a consequence of the new Regulation, all professional drivers throughout the Community will be subject to the same rules in relation to driving times, breaks and rest periods.</P><Col N="257"/>
        <P>While I appreciate that the new EU legislation will have implications for the coach tourism industry, the safety of passengers and other road users is paramount and the coach industry must play its part in relation to safety on our roads.  The coach sector has over 1 year to reorganise their work practices in order to comply with the new rules and minimise the impact on their operations.</P>

	<P>The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA), the Agency with responsibility for Luas and Metro projects has made progress on Metro North including completion of a comprehensive public consultation process on route selection.  This consultation process included distributing over 100,000 newsletters, advertising widely on national and local radio and in national and local press, holding six public open days, and meeting with residents associations and other representative groups along the proposed routes. The merits of the consultation exercise were clearly demonstrated by the emergence of an alternative route to address concerns raised by local residents and key stakeholders.  That route was also the subject of further public consultation.  </P>
        <P>I announced the preferred route of Metro North on 19 October 2006.  On the 21 December 2006, the RPA announced the publication of an information notice for the Metro North project in the Official Journal of the European Union (&ldquo;OJEU&rdquo;). This is the first significant move in the tendering process for the Metro North public private partnership. The primary objective of the information notice is to encourage the widest participation in the project to achieve competition and value for money.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the Board of the RPA will make a decision shortly to proceed further with the procurement process for the project.  I expect the RPA to commence the Railway Order Application process in consultation with An Bord Plean&aacute;la before the end of this year.  It will then be a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to consider and make a decision on that application.</P>

	<P>If Shannon Airport is to develop as a successful and sustainable business, it is clear that one of the issues that must be addressed in its business plan is the airport&rsquo;s uncompetitive cost base. If that obstacle can be removed the Airport has a real opportunity to develop new markets and to attract the airline customers that it needs for its commercial future. </P>
        <P>While industrial relations are a matter for the DAA, I would point out that the company, under the auspices of the LRC, has made substantial efforts to find agreement with trade unions on how the airport can operate efficiently and sustainably. Unfortunately rationalisation proposals, on which the LRC worked closely with management and unions was put to ballot recently and rejected by staff. It is the priority of  management that Shannon airport&rsquo;s uncompetitive cost base is now addressed as a matter of urgency in order to meet the business and operational needs of the airport.  I am hopeful that there is now the right climate to initiate meaningful negotiations, with the assistance of the LRC, so that Shannon Airport&rsquo;s sustainability can be addressed once and for all.</P>

	<P>The Road Safety Authority (RSA), which has responsibility for road safety advertising and promotion, has acknowledged that driver fatigue could be a contributory factor in up to a fifth of driver deaths in Ireland. They also say that driving when very tired is as dangerous as driving while over the drink drive limit.  The Authority revealed these facts at the launch of their winter road safety campaign in October 2006, which highlighted the dangers of driver fatigue. That campaign included a 30 second radio advert and poster advertising in garage forecourts that are designed to communicate the dangers of fatigue when driving.  Details of the Authority&rsquo;s current campaign on dealing with driver fatigue are available on its website at <i>www.rsa.ie</i>. </P>
        <P>The Question Bank for the driver theory test includes questions regarding fatigue so that learner drivers are aware before they commence driving of the dangers of driving while fatigued.  In 2006 I requested that the National Roads Authority (NRA) examine their policy in relation to the provision of service and rest areas on the national road network. The NRA have subsequently issued a revised policy statement on service areas and rest areas on motorways and dual carriageways which provides for the provision of service areas at intervals of approximately 50-60kms and for rest areas (parking, toilet block, picnic facilities) at intervals of approximately 25-30kms. Full details of the strategy are available on the NRA&rsquo;s website at<i> www.nra.ie.</i></P>

	<P>The direct provision system seeks to ensure that the accommodation and ancillary services provided by the State meet the requirements of asylum seekers during the period in which their requests for asylum are being processed.   In addition, a direct provision allowance of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child was introduced some years ago and is paid by Community Welfare Officers (operating under the aegis of the Department of Social and Family Affairs) who also have the discretion to make once-off exceptional needs payments in special situations.

	<P>The Public Sector <Col N="266"/>Transfer Network provides that, in the case of transfers to and from certain groups with enhanced superannuation terms, i.e. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prisons Service, a system of &ldquo;uniform accrual&rdquo; must operate.  Groups with enhanced superannuation terms are those where service in excess 20 years is doubled, so that 30 years actual pensionable service equates to 40 years for the calculation of superannuation benefits.  The initial 20 years count year for year and each subsequent year counts as double.  Army service does not attract the enhanced superannuation terms.</P>
        <P>Under the system of &ldquo;uniform accrual&rdquo;, service transferred from the Army to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is credited at a rate of &frac34; of the Army service.  The reduced service, when added to Garda service, attracts the &ldquo;doubling benefit&rdquo; provisions for service in excess of 20 years.  Conversely, service transferred from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Army is credited at a rate of 4/3rds of the Garda service for the purpose of calculating Army superannuation benefits.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance Circular 6/95 provides that employees recruited on or after 6 April, 1995 are liable to pay full PRSI contributions from their pay.

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that bottled water was standard rated with effect from November 1992. This change was made to correct a competitive anomaly, as prior to that non manufactured bottled water was zero rated while similar competing products such as soft drinks were standard rated. The change in the VAT treatment coincided with the removal of excise duty from bottled water in November 1992. </P>
        <P>Where a product was zero rated prior to 1 January 1991 but subsequently standard rated: it is not possible to reintroduce the zero rate for that product. However, under Annex III of the EU VAT Directive, Member States are permitted to apply a reduced rate to bottled water. It would therefore be possible under EU VAT rules to apply a reduced rate of 13.5%, rather than 21% to these products.</P><Col N="267"/>
        <P>In any event, if there was a reduction in the rate of VAT applying to bottled water, I am not convinced, given the mark ups in the sector, that any rate reduction would necessarily be fully reflected in retail prices for bottled water.</P>

	<P>The purchase of land, with an intention to build housing, by an individual or a developer normally attracts a stamp duty liability.  Where a developer buys land and incurs a stamp duty liability, it is reasonable to assume that the stamp duty charge will be included in the final price being paid by home purchaser.  The Deputy will be aware that I have introduced a Committee Stage amendment to the Finance Bill 2007 to deal with tax avoidance by developers using licensing and resting in contract arrangements where stamp duty is not paid on the use of the site by the developer.  As regards the proposal by the Deputy, I will keep the matter under review but any such new relief for a site would need to be carefully devised to ensure that the first-time buyer would build a house on it within a short specified period and not sell it on for speculative purposes.</P>

	<P>The issues of nurses&rsquo; pay and working hours have been fully processed through the State&rsquo;s industrial relations structures and procedures &mdash; the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  While health service management have accepted the Labour Court Recommendation, the Irish Nurses Organisation and Psychiatric Nurses Association state that they have neither accepted nor rejected this Recommendation and have instead served notice of industrial action. Discussions regarding impending industrial action have been led by the Health Service Executive &mdash; Employers Agency. These discussions form part of the process of established industrial relations practices and procedures. Officials from my Department have been included in these discussions as appropriate and have ensured that I have been fully briefed on the issues.</P>
        <P>Social partnership agreements have created and sustained the conditions for economic growth over the last decade and significantly enhanced the position of employees in the public and private sector. The Government has agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions a basis on which pay and conditions for the public service as a whole should be managed and the second Benchmarking Body has been established to provide an objective means of assessing the appropriate pay for particular groups or professions. However, the Irish Nurses Organisation and Psychiatric Nurses Association are refusing to co-operate with the current Benchmarking process which is reviewing the pay of public servants and is due to report in the second half of 2007. The INO and PNA have so far declined to sign up to the new national partnership agreement &mdash; Towards 2016. Instead both unions lodged eight cost increasing claims for improvements in pay and conditions. The additional cost of these claims would be almost &euro;1 billion per annum. The Unions are also seeking retrospection estimated to cost in excess of &euro;500m.</P><Col N="269"/>
        <P>These claims were lodged during the lifetime of the Sustaining Progress Agreement  which prohibited cost increasing claims. Both unions had signed up to Sustaining Progress and their members had received increases of 13.16% under this agreement, in addition to Benchmarking increases of between 8% and 16%.</P>
        <P>The claims lodged by the Unions were the subject of an indepth examination by the Labour Court which issued its Recommendation last November. The Court did not recommend concession of the major cost increasing pay claims. Instead the Court urged the Unions concerned to reconsider their position with regard to Benchmarking so as to have their pay claims examined through that process.</P>
        <P>In relation to the claim for a reduction in working hours from 39 to 35 hours per week, the Court recommended that the parties should jointly explore the possibility of initiating an appropriate process aimed at achieving major reorganisation of working arrangements and practices within the health service generally. The Court also stated that such an initiative should take account of and support existing development involving other groups. It held the view that if such a programme of change could be successfully implemented, the efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits accruing may allow this claim to be processed within a reasonable timeframe to be agreed between the parties.</P>
        <P>The Benchmarking Body is due to report in the second half of the year and is in a position to review the issues that the nursing unions feel strongly about. I believe that a solution to the current dispute can be found within the context of the Labour Court Recommendation and the prevailing national agreements. In this regard I arranged for exploratory discussions to be held between all the parties concerned at the offices of the HSE-Employers Agency on 19 January 2007.  While I understand the discussions provided clarity as to the respective positions of the parties the meeting adjourned without agreement on the way forward.</P>
        <P>It remains the Government&rsquo;s view that Benchmarking is the appropriate mechanism to resolve the pay issues. Management have offered to enter into discussions on  an appropriate process aimed at achieving major reorganisation of working arrangements and practices within the health service generally and remain available for further discussions within the context of the Labour Court Recommendation and the prevailing national agreements.  I would ask the INO and PNA to give further consideration to the Recommendation of the Labour Court and to make the case on behalf of their members, as other nursing unions have done, before the Benchmarking Body.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The assessment of eligibility to medical cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants. Under Section 45 of the Health 1970 medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Section 58 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, provides for GP visit cards for adult persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the HSE, and notwithstanding that they do not qualify for a medical card, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange GP medical  and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Persons aged 70 and over are statutorily entitled to a medical card, regardless of income. In all other cases an assessment of means is undertaken.</P>
        <P>In assessing eligibility, the HSE use guidelines based on people&rsquo;s means, which includes their income, certain allowable outgoings and the effect of  other factors which may impact on people&rsquo;s ability to meet the cost of GP services. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and  a decision to refuse an application or renewal of a medical card may be appealed to the Executive for further consideration.</P>
        <P>Domiciliary Care Allowance may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.  Eligibility is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required rather than to the type of disability involved. Medical Reviews on recipients are carried out based on the recommendation of the Senior Area Medical Officer/Area Medical Officer in the HSE.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to  arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future. </P>
        <P>A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates, including speech and language therapists. In response to concerns regarding labour shortages, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions to 2015 in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists (Bacon Report).</P>
        <P>The report was published in 2001 and arising from its recommendations additional courses in speech and language therapy providing 75 places were established in three universities. UCC, NUIG and UL each established courses in speech and language therapy with 25 places on each of the 3 courses.  The first cohort of graduates from the UL masters level courses in speech and language therapy courses graduated in 2005 and the first cohort from the bachelor degree programmes in UCC and NUIG will graduate this year. This investment represents an increase in training capacity of 300% in speech and language therapy.  The total number of speech and language therapy training places now stands at 100, the level at which the Bacon Report recommended as being sufficient to meet current and future <Col N="276"/>demand to 2015 for speech and language therapists.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.

	<P>Significant renewable energy resources are being harnessed to contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s energy consumption in the electricity, heat and transport markets.  I have forwarded a graph detailing energy flow in Ireland in 2005 to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The graph and the following table, which are based on data supplied by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and additional data available from EirGrid, record the most up-to-date statistics available to my Department.</P>
        <P>In 2005, use of renewable energy generally in the residential sector amounted to 44 kilo tonnes of oil equivalent, in the commercial sector amounted to 3 kilo tonnes of oil equivalent and in the industrial sector amounted to 163 kilo tonnes of oil equivalent. Biomass represented the majority fuel input in these sectors. I expect that the deployment of renewable energy technologies <Col N="279"/>will increase significantly over the coming years, as a result of recent funding initiatives including the &euro;26m Bioheat programme aimed at the commercial, community and voluntary sector, the &euro;11m CHP programme and the &euro;47m Greener Homes programme aimed at the domestic sector.</P>

<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P FLI="0">I have established a target to increase the production of electricity from renewable energy sources from the EU target of 13.2% to 15% by 2010. The Taoiseach has announced a target of 33% of gross electricity consumption from renewable energy sources by 2020.</P>
        <P>Wind energy will be the dominant technology in the electricity market to 2010. The contribution by technology to 2020 is more difficult to predict. The outturn will depend on the development of the all-island market and technological developments within individual technologies including energy storage from wind turbines and developments under RD&amp;D programmes nationally and internationally in the other renewable technologies.</P>
        <P>In 2006, I launched a new ocean energy strategy, which aims to put Ireland at the forefront of ocean energy development and position us to capitalise on this resource. The strategy was developed by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>As the first stage in implementing this strategy, we have recently upgraded the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre in UCC as well as opening an ocean energy test site a mile and a half off the coast of Spiddal, Co Galway. SEI and the Marine Institute are also currently supporting a number of other ocean energy research and development initiatives.</P>
        <P>The second phase of the strategy will see the development of pre-commercial grid connected devices and provide for a grid connection to a suitable test site. This phase is expected to be activated in the period 2008 to 2010, pending the outcome of the tests in phase one.</P>
        <P>Phase three of the Strategy, which is envisaged for 2011 to 2015, involves supporting a 10MW array of devices which would be connected to the grid.</P>
        <P>Clearly the pace of technological development will have an impact on the dates for implementation of the strategy. This is an area that I will be requesting the Energy Research Council to examine, with a view to accelerating RD&amp;D work in this developing and promising area. The <Col N="280"/>recently announced Charles Parsons awards have also provided funding to University College Cork for the research activity focussed on two main areas &mdash; Ocean Energy Resources and Ocean Energy Device Modelling. The research into Ocean Energy Resources assesses the wave energy resources and the tidal stream resources while the Ocean Energy Device Modelling develops tools and methods for the prediction and optimisation of performance.</P>
        <P>Ireland has one of the most promising ocean energy resources in the world, and the Government aims to position Ireland to take full advantage of this resource in the future.</P>
        <P>The European Commission&rsquo;s Biomass Action Plan states that the EU could double biomass energy production by 2010. A series of measures are proposed including a possible heating and cooling Directive and Ireland is engaging proactively on this debate. The forthcoming White Paper on Energy Policy will address targets for renewables including biomass in the heating sector to 2020.</P>
        <P>The development of an Irish biofuels market and the increased development and deployment of bio-energy resources in Ireland is a key priority for the Government. A range of initiatives are in place to support the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland. In 2005, market penetration of biofuels was 0.05%. I have introduced a number of measures in the past two years which will allow Ireland achieve targets of 2% in 2008, 5.75% in 2009 and 10% in 2010.</P>
        <P>These targets will be delivered through the two excise relief programmes rolled out by my Department in 2005 and 2006, and through the introduction of a biofuels obligation, which I announced on Monday 12th February. The obligation will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.</P>
        <P>I will forward the Deputy a copy of SEI&rsquo;s publication &ldquo;Energy in Ireland 1990-2005&rdquo;, published in November 2006, which provides detailed statistics on energy trends, forecasts and indicators.</P>

	<P>The function of the Licensing <Col N="281"/>Authority for sea-fishing boats was transferred under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 to the Registrar General of Fishing Boats. The Act provides that the Licensing Authority is independent in the exercise of its functions under the Act, subject to the law for the time being in force and policy directives in relation to sea-fishing boat licensing. </P>
        <P>The Registrar General has informed me that his files show that the individual applied for a sea fishing boat licence under the scheme for the Licensing of Traditional Pot Fishing Boats in June 2003. He was refused a licence under this scheme as he did not satisfy the criterion &ldquo;the applicant must not have or had a vessel licensed or registered on the Irish Fishing Boat Register since January 1990 other than in the Specific Segment&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Applicant appealed this decision and the Independent Appeals Officer refused his appeal.  The applicant must apply for a standard fishing boat licence should he wish to fish commercially.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) are trade agreements currently being negotiated between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states. </P>
        <P>The mandate for the negotiation of EPAs comes from the legally-binding Cotonou Agreement, the central objective of which is that of &ldquo;reducing and eventually eradicating poverty, consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Negotiations began in September 2002 and the agreements are required to enter into force by 1 January 2008.  For the purposes of EPA negotiations, the ACP states are organised into six regional groupings. The concept of regional integration is fundamental to the EPA process.</P>
        <P>On their own, the small segmented markets of the ACP countries are poorly positioned to take advantage of the global trading system. I believe that stronger regional integration will facilitate an increase in production and competitiveness. This <Col N="282"/>is the critical first step toward greater participation in international trade, with all the benefits of new markets which this promises.</P>
        <P>I realise, however, that if the ACP States are to take full advantage of the trading opportunities afforded by EPAs, greater and more effective trade-related assistance will be required to be made available to them.</P>
        <P>In this regard, EU Ministers for Development and the European Commission have already pledged to ensure that a substantial share of EU and national trade-related assistance will be devoted to the needs of ACP states, with the collective total allocation rising to some &euro;2 billion per annum by 2010.</P>
        <P>In Ireland&rsquo;s case and in line with the priorities outlined in the recent White Paper on Irish Aid, we have committed to increase substantially our funding for Aid for Trade initiatives in the coming years.  I hope that the deadline envisaged under the Cotonou Agreement will be met and that the question of an extension will not arise.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to follow the negotiations closely and insist that they be conducted at all times in a manner sensitive to the development needs of the ACP states and their poverty reduction efforts.</P>

        <Quest> if he will refer the European Parliament Committee&rsquo;s Report on Extraordinary Rendition to a Parliamentary Committee as recommended in the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made clear on a number of occasions my disappointment with the content of the Report of the Temporary Committee of the European Parliament on extraordinary rendition. In particular, the Committee&rsquo;s figure of 147 allegedly-suspicious flights is grossly inflated, as shown by the identification of only 3 suspicious flights by Senator Dick Marty as part of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s separate investigations. </P>
        <P>I was one of only two Ministers for Foreign Affairs to attend a meeting of the TDIP Committee. However, I regret that certain members of the Committee did not avail of the opportunity to produce a forward-looking document, and ignored my suggestions about the changes that, in my view, need to be made to the regulation of international civil aviation.</P>
        <P>The Report&rsquo;s call for the Government &ldquo;to agree to launch a parliamentary inquiry into the use of Irish territory as part of the CIA rendition circuit&rdquo; ignores the fact that it is for the Oireachtas to decide its own work schedule. It also ignores the fact that Seanad &Eacute;ireann has on three separate occasions&mdash;most recently on 31 <Col N="283"/>January&mdash;voted not to institute a specific enquiry. These issues have been extensively debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas, and both have passed motions supporting the Government&rsquo;s policy in this area, the Seanad on 31 January, the D&aacute;il on 14 June 2006.</P>
        <P>Rather than calling for more enquiries, I would suggest that the time has come to focus on what concrete measures we might take to help prevent or deter extraordinary rendition in the future, which practice I have consistently condemned in the strongest terms. It is with this objective that my Department is exploring with European partners the issues I have raised in relation to the regulation of civil aviation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 to 235, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In response to approaches from South Dublin County Council, the FAI and Shamrock Rovers FC, I gave a commitment on behalf of the Government that funding would be provided towards the completion of a soccer stadium in Tallaght. The specifications for the stadium is that it would be capable of hosting senior soccer fixtures and that it would provide capacity for 6,000 seated spectators, which is the capacity decreed under the planning approval.  In supporting the provision of a soccer stadium at Tallaght, I am seeking to bring to completion a long-standing project for a stadium on this site.</P>
        <P>Under the Sports Capital Programme, my Department has provided funding of &euro;2.57m towards this project over the 3 years 2000 to 2002. &euro;2.44m has already been provided to Shamrock Rovers Stadium Development Committee based <Col N="286"/>on work, to the value of &euro;3.3m,  carried out prior to the end of 2002.</P>
        <P>I have made my position clear to the GAA at both national and Dublin County Board level on a number of occasions. My Department has had meetings with senior officials of the South Dublin County Council, the FAI and the GAA in seeking to progress the project.  I am deeply disappointed at the continuing impediment that is delaying this project and which could have serious additional cost implications for it&rsquo;s development.</P>
        <P>While the stadium is scheduled for completion as a soccer facility, I would have no objections to South Dublin County Council, which will manage the facility, facilitating its use for other sporting events compatible with it remaining available for senior soccer fixtures.  When it is feasible to do so I intend to work closely with South Dublin County Council to complete the stadium in a timely and cost effective manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Article 2.1 of the Common Position 2003/468/CFSP of 23 June 2003 on the control of arms brokering obliges EU Member States to take all necessary measures to control brokering activities taking place within their territory and also encourages them to consider controlling brokering activities outside of their territories when carried out by brokers of their nationality resident or established in their territory. </P>
        <P>When framing the provisions of the Control of Exports Bill with regard to the regulation of brokering activities in the State, a key consideration was the highly mobile nature of arms brokering.   A person normally resident here, could for example arrange for an arms transfer, while temporally outside the State, of goods that at no point transit through Ireland.  In the absence of appropriate legislation, on his or her return to Ireland, no prosecution could follow, notwith<Col N="287"/>standing that an arms embargo may have been breached or that Irish export control laws may have been evaded.</P>
        <P>A number of other EU Member States, including Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden have enacted legislation to provide for controls on extra-territorial activities by arms brokers and I am satisfied therefore that this principle has been established in international law.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that there are challenges with regard to the enforcement of extra-territorial controls.  However on balance, I consider it preferable to have such controls in place so that if documentary evidence concerning illicit arms brokering does become available, for example as a result of the sharing of intelligence between law enforcement agencies, then the State has the capacity to mount a successful prosecution.</P>

	<P>I have no responsibility for airport taxes or charges.  Airlines determine the policy they will practice in situations where people voluntarily cancel flights.  Different airlines have different policies in this respect.  In most cases airlines will offer refunds only on payment of a service fee.   </P>
        <P>I must emphasise that the cancellation of a flight by a consumer and the financial consequences of such cancellation is a civil matter under contract law and thus not something for which I have responsibility.  I would advise consumers to read the conditions in the contract to make themselves aware of the consequences of cancelling a flight ticket.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Director of Consumer Affairs and Executive Chair of the Board of the National Consumer Agency to examine the terms and conditions imposed by different airlines to assess their conformity with consumer legislation including in particular the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations, 1995 (S.

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency. While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>During 2006 IDA hosted two site visits by potential investors to the IDA Advance Unit in Athy, but neither company found it suitable for their needs.  There were no visits to Newbridge, Monasterevin, Kildare, Kilcullen, Castledermot, Rathangan or Ballymore Eustace in 2006.</P>
        <P>A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of Balanced Regional Development. The National Spatial Strategy provides a framework for the achievement of this goal through the prioritization of development and investment in gateway towns and hub locations.</P>
        <P>While IDA has sites in Kildare Town, Monasterevin and Castledermot, which they are actively promoting, decisions regarding where to locate are ultimately up to the individual investor.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, IDA Ireland continues to work with the existing client base in County Kildare to expand their presence in the County and to encourage increased cooperation with third level institutions in the County.  In the 10 year period from 1996 to 2006  the number of permanent jobs in IDA supported companies in County Kildare has risen from 6,797 to 10,869 an increase of  4,072.</P>

	<P>From 14 to 19 January 2007, An Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, led Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s very successful trade mission to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE).  He was accompanied by Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Miche&aacute;l Martin; Minister for Agriculture and <Col N="289"/>Food Mary Coughlan,  Minister for Education and Science Mary Hanafin, and a total of 114 Irish companies.</P>
        <P>Four of the participating companies that accompanied the recent trade mission were from County Kildare. These were Ash Technologies, Ashbourne Meat Processors, Doyle Engineering and Irish Thoroughbred Marketing.</P>
        <P>Potential participants on any Enterprise Ireland organised trade event are canvassed in advance to ascertain their interest in becoming involved. The canvass is based on existing exporters to that particular market; potential exporters identified by Enterprise Ireland and companies which Enterprise Ireland has previously worked with, in the market. Organisations such as the Chambers of Commerce, County Enterprise Boards, Irish Exporters Association and bodies such as Bord Bia and  BIM may also be approached, where appropriate, to ascertain their interest and that of their members in participation. For the Gulf mission, a web site was also created for potential participants, which outlined details of the Trade Mission and the procedures involved. Given the criteria as set out above, this overall process is not, obviously, undertaken on a county-by-county basis.</P>

	<P>From 14th to 19th January 2007, An Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, led Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s trade mission to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE).  He was accompanied by Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Miche&aacute;l Martin; Minister for Agriculture and Food Mary Coughlan and Minister for Education and Science Mary Hanafin. The mission visited Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.</P>
        <P>The mission involved a total of 114 Irish companies, organisations and educational institutions, primarily involved in the ICT, Educational Services, Environmental/ Engineering Services, <Col N="290"/>Medical Devices and Food and Drinks sectors. Over 1,200 meetings took place between the Irish participants and their potential and existing customers.</P>
        <P>Initial estimates from companies and organisations participating in the mission, place the value of agreements reached at &euro;65 million over the next 12 to 36 months. In addition to these specific agreements reached and, also, for the longer term, we would envisage a steady increase in the level of trade between Ireland and these countries. The exact rate of increase for the future is not possible to estimate at this stage.</P>
        <P>Drawing a direct one-to-one correlation between trade missions and their impact on exports or imports in the short or long term, is obviously extremely difficult. The objectives of participants can vary in nature, as some will be at different stages of export development.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a very significant trade surplus with both Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. so in relation to imports from there, it is likely, given the very low level of imports at present, that the pattern will be upwards. While is not possible to make firm predictions, the pattern has been that the improved linkages and business contacts generated in export promotion, can also lead to an expansion in imports from those countries also.</P>
        <P>Trade Missions are an important activity in overall export promotion strategy in Ireland and they play a key part of strategic business development in other industrialised countries.  It should be noted that such missions are not simply focussed on developing trade but are now increasingly creating opportunities over a range of business areas &mdash; creating linkages and building contacts and networks that will produce benefits over the very long term.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Social welfare pensions, both contributory and non-contributory, are paid on the basis of a person&rsquo;s personal entitlement to a payment having satisfied the qualifying conditions and there is no right to inherit a pension on the death of the pensioner.   The surviving spouse of a pensioner may apply for a widow(er)&rsquo;s contributory pension which can be based on either the deceased&rsquo;s or surviving spouse&rsquo;s insurance contributions.   Alternatively, a means-tested widow&rsquo;s non-contributory pension may be paid where the surviving spouse is under 66.  Those 66 and over who do not qualify for a widow(er)&rsquo;s contributory pension may apply for the means tested state pen<Col N="291"/>sion (non-contributory) which is paid regardless of a person&rsquo;s status. Eligibility for widows and widowers pensions is confined to surviving members of married couples, it does not apply to cohabiting couples.</P>
        <P>There are no &lsquo;inheritance&rsquo; rights in respect of occupational pension schemes in that a member cannot &lsquo;will&rsquo; his or her pension entitlements. Occupational pension schemes are set up as trusts and the trustees will pay out benefits to surviving spouses/partners of deceased members in accordance with the rules of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Benefits are generally payable by pension schemes on the death of a member in service and on death-in-retirement and the trust deed and rules will specify the form and amounts of the benefits payable in the different circumstances.  Death in service benefits in most schemes take the form of a lump sum but many schemes in addition also pay pension benefits to spouses and other beneficiaries.</P>
        <P>Benefits paid in pension form will be a percentage of the deceased member&rsquo;s actual or prospective pension as the case may be and will be paid by the trustees to the relevant recipient (s) for their lifetime.</P>
        <P>Some pension schemes provide benefits only for the &lsquo;lawful spouses&rsquo; of deceased married members without providing any equivalent death benefits for non-marital cohabiting, or non-cohabiting, partners.  That is a matter of scheme design and schemes, being voluntary by nature, are not obliged by law to provide death benefits to either surviving spouses or surviving partners unless their rules so provide.</P>
        <P>Other schemes may provide for payment of death benefits to &lsquo;dependants&rsquo; rather than spouses of deceased members.  The scheme rules will generally define what is meant by &lsquo;dependants&rsquo;.  The definition will generally include the spouse of the member and anyone dependent on the member for the ordinary necessities of life.  Trustees may need to exercise some element of judgement in this regard in ensuring the benefits are paid in a form and in shares which reflect the needs of the dependants. Often there are discretionary powers given to the trustees in the scheme rules to enable them to decide on the destination of death benefits.</P>
        <P>Most pension schemes provide for payment of lump sum death benefits to be made directly to spouses or dependants rather than to the estate of the deceased.  The deceased member may have completed a form of nomination of dependant wherein they nominate the person to benefit from the lump sum payment.  Such a letter or expression of wishes cannot bind the trustees but they will normally try to give effect to the deceased members&rsquo; wishes. If the lump sum payment is made to the estate then it will devolve in accordance with the deceased member&rsquo;s will or <Col N="292"/>under the rules of intestacy.  It is only lump sum payments that may be administered through the deceased members&rsquo; estate if these have been paid to the deceased member&rsquo;s personal representative by the trustees of the scheme.</P>

	<P>From September 2007 people in receipt of another social welfare payment who are also providing full time care and attention to a person will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent of a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance. A person currently in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance who may have an underlying entitlement to another social welfare payment will be able to transfer to that payment and <Col N="294"/>receive up to a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance. This does not apply to persons in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or benefit, given the nature of these payments. </P>
        <P>In order to qualify under these new arrangements people will have to satisfy all of the qualifying conditions which currently apply to carer&rsquo;s allowance. These include the requirement that applicants must be providing full time care and attention to a person who needs such care, be aged 18 or over, be habitually resident in the state and satisfy a means test. In addition, the person being cared for must need continuous supervision and frequent help throughout the day with their personal needs or continuous supervision to avoid danger to themselves and require full time care and attention for at least 12 months.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that approximately 18,000 carers will benefit from this measure at cost of some &euro;57 million in a full year. This provision was part of the overall Budget package which involved major improvements across the range of social welfare schemes. The implementation dates for these various provisions are determined having regard to the legal, financial and administrative implications involved.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme element of Transport 21. The implementation of individual national road projects and the allocation of monies to those projects, including projects on the Atlantic Road Corridor, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under sections 17 and 19 of the Roads Act, 1993 in conjunction with the relevant local authorities concerned.</P>
        <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2007-2013 funding for the Galway-Limerick section of the Atlantic Corridor has been accelerated, with construction of approximately 50kms of dual carriageway on this route now set to commence in 2008, instead of 2011.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The level of motor insurance premiums is measured by the CSO using as a base the costs obtaining in December 2001 which is allocated an index of 100. Using this scale, the costs for motor insurance in January 1997 measured 64.8 index points. From that date, costs rose to a peak of 108 index points in April 2003.  Since April 2003 motor insurance costs have reduced and at December 2006, the index stood at 71.2 index points, a reduction of  34% over the period.</P>
        <P>There are various factors contributing to this reduction. Since 2003, the introduction of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board has been a major step, as was the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 which includes penalties for giving false or misleading evidence in personal injury cases. In addition, random breath testing, increased resources to the Garda Traffic Corps and the roll-out of the penalty points system are expected to deliver better driver behaviour and reduced frequency of traffic accidents. These initiatives are having a positive effect on motor insurance premiums and I am confident that they will continue to do so.</P>

	<P>One of the key objectives of our aviation policy as set out in my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2005-2007 is to facilitate and encourage as wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive commercial air services for Irish tourism, trade and industry.  Our success in this regard is evident in the increased number of direct services to and from Ireland that are now available to the travelling public.  </P>
        <P>The aviation industry is a global industry that has demonstrated a capacity for innovation and an ability to respond to the significant challenges that it has faced in recent years, as was particularly evidenced in the industry&rsquo;s response in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. The industry has also made significant strides in improving fuel efficiency over recent years through technical innovation.  I would, therefore, have a more optimistic view than the Deputy of the capacity of the industry to respond to challenges that it may face in the future.</P>

	<P>As I stated in my reply to Question 5821/07 the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 established the IAA  and among the primary functions conferred on it under the Act is safety regulation of the Irish aviation industry. The Authority exercises its safety regulation functions in accordance with international standards set at both European level by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) and globally by the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO).  To that end a total of 900 hundred plus inspections were conducted in 2006 as part of an integrated audit programme of flight operations and maintenance in Irish Aviation. </P>
        <P>As Minister for Transport my responsibility in relation to the safety functions of the Irish Aviation Authority arises under Section 32 of the 1993 Irish Aviation Authority Act, which requires me periodically, to commission an examination of the performance by the company of its functions insofar as they relate to the application and enforcement of technical and safety standards in relation to aircraft and air navigation. The most recent examination took place in 2004 and concluded that there is a general, positive and proactive attitude and competence vis-&agrave;-vis safety and the maintenance of a high safety level in the organisation.  It is my intention to commission a further examination this year in accordance with the provisions of Section 32.</P>
        <P>The Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) in my Department investigates accidents and incidents on a case-by-case basis. None of the AAIU investigations and reports on recent Public Scheduled Transport category occurrences have identified broad industry deficiencies. Reports of accidents and incidents investigated by the AAIU, including any safety recommendations made and responded to are publicly available and are published on my Department&rsquo;s AAIU website, www.aaiu.ie.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256 to 261, inclusive, 265 and 268 together.</P>
        <P>There has been major investment in recent years in expanding the number and capacity of commuter services on the Kildare and Maynooth lines.</P>
        <P>The provision of turnback facilities at Newbridge, the extension of platforms at Sallins and Hazelhatch and the introduction of new rolling stock on the Kildare route as part of the increased investment in public transport under the NDP 2000-2006 have increased capacity on the Kildare route by 160%.</P>
        <P>Capacity on the Maynooth line has been more than trebled in the last five years due to the doubling of the track, resignalling and the upgrading of stations and crossings.</P><Col N="299"/>
        <P>There are now 35 services per day in each direction serving Maynooth and approximately the same number in each direction serving stations on the Kildare line.</P>
        <P>Irish Rail have implemented further recent improvements to their services with the introduction of their new timetable on 14 January 2007 which included the introduction, for the first time, of scheduled Sunday commuter services on the Kildare commuter line with services operating five times each way, at approximately two hour intervals.</P>
        <P>In addition, Maynooth line Sunday service frequencies were further improved, with hourly services operating on the half hour from 09.30hrs to 18.30hrs from Dublin Pearse, and services operating approximately every hour from 10.30hrs to 19.30hrs from Maynooth.</P>
        <P>A number of major projects being funded under Transport 21 will further improve rail services in Co. Kildare. The Docklands station, which is due to open in March, will facilitate extra services on the Maynooth line. The introduction of a fleet of modern intercity railcars to be delivered in the period 2007 to 2009 will release commuter railcars currently being used on intercity routes such as Sligo-Dublin and Rosslare &mdash; Dublin for use on the Maynooth line amongst others.  The Kildare Route Project, which involves four tracking a section of track from Cherry Orchard to Hazlehatch, will enable the separation of long distance and commuter services thus reducing travel times and offering operational flexibility to increase the amount of services provided. As part of that project upgraded stations and increased parking capacity are to be provided.</P>
        <P>Feeder bus services to/from, and car parking facilities at, commuter rail stations are operational matters for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. However, in 2006 and 2007 my Department has allocated funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />expansion/improvement works at the car park serving Leixlip-Louisabridge railway station to increase the total car parking available at the station by 290 spaces;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />expansion/improvement works at the car park serving Newbridge railway station to increase the total car parking available at the station by 300 spaces;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the planning and design of upgraded car parking facilities at other stations in county Kildare, including Kildare and Athy.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">In addition, car park provision will form part of major new railway infrastructure works such as the Kildare Route Project.</P>

The issue of setting a maximum vehicle height limit was the subject of a wide ranging public consultation exercise in 2005. A period of two years is proposed for the phasing out of the use of existing vehicles that exceed the proposed height limit of 4.65 metres. The draft regulation will be submitted to the European Commission for consultation shortly.</P>

        <P>I am also firmly of the view that Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests are best served by having as many airlines as possible competing vigorously and seeking to exploit all possible opportunities for new services.

	<P>The issues raised by the Deputy will be addressed by the relevant implementation agencies generally as part of the statutory approval process for each project. Most of the major projects will require motorway schemes, railway orders or compulsory purchase orders and substantial progress has already been made in this regard. For example, the statutory approval process for all the projects on the five interurban motorways are now complete. Recent months have seen Railway Orders signed for a number of projects such as the Kildare rail upgrade and the Luas extensions to Cherrywood and Docklands.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the main objectives of Transport 21 is to alleviate traffic congestion. This will be achieved by providing vastly improved national road network that bypasses major towns and by providing a <Col N="302"/>public transport system that acts as an attractive alternative to the private car.</P>
        <P>As Transport 21 progresses and more projects are completed, the level of congestion on our roads will reduce. Already significant strides have been made since the launch of Transport 21. A record number of road projects were completed and commenced in 2006. Increased capacity has been provided on both the intercity and suburban rail networks.</P>
        <P>Funding has been provided to both Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann for additional bus capacity and there is continuing substantial investment in bus priority measures in Dublin and the regional cities. The trams on the Luas Red Line are being extended to provide 40% extra capacity. My Department recently approved the purchase of additional trams for both Luas Lines. The Docklands railway system will open shortly and this will be accompanied by an increased level of train services on the Maynooth line from Clonsilla.</P>

	<P>The group in question was awarded Dormant Accounts funding of &euro;129,010 by the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board under the initial round of funding.  The grant was to fund a youth worker, administration and programme costs over a two-year period.  My understanding is that this funding will expire at the end of the summer this year.  </P>
        <P>Deputies will appreciate that the Dormant Accounts Fund cannot of its nature be regarded as a source of indefinite funding for specific projects. However, I am keen to ensure where projects can demonstrate strong impacts in tackling disadvantage and are coming to the end of their funding term, full consideration is given by relevant Departments to their possible mainstreaming.</P>
        <P>To assist in this process, I recently secured Government approval for the allocation of additional Dormant Accounts funding to enable a limited number of projects, approved by the former Board under the initial round of funding, to continue for a defined period. This funding will be targeted at certain projects that are awaiting <Col N="303"/>decisions by Government Departments or Statutory Agencies on mainstreaming. My Department is currently considering the operational arrangements for this funding measure with other relevant Departments.</P>
        <P>The group in question may qualify for further Dormant Accounts funding in this context.</P>

        <P>The restructuring aid must be implemented strictly in accordance with the relevant EU Regulations. Under the Regulations, eligibility for the EU restructuring aid for the sugar industry is confined to three categories: processors, beet growers and certain specialised machinery contractors who worked under contract for the growers. Eligible machinery contractors shall be compensated for the loss incurred following the loss of value of specialised machinery, which cannot be used for other purposes. In accordance with the EU Regulations, the Government in July made certain decisions concerning the implementation of the restructuring aid, in particular the percentage to <Col N="304"/>be reserved for beet growers and machinery contractors.  These decisions were announced by press release on 12 July 2006.  The Government decisions are now the subject of Judicial Review proceedings instituted by Greencore Group plc in the High Court.  If the person named was not a specialised machinery contractor who worked under contract for growers, he would not be eligible for compensation under the Regulations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department, in the context of delivering the Single Payment Scheme, is required to carry out on-the-spot inspections on a number of farms covering such issues as eligibility under the Scheme, compliance with EU legislation in the areas of the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health and ensuring that the farm is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition.</P>
        <P>A minimum of 5% of Single Payment Scheme applicants are required to be inspected under the eligibility rule.  Up to two-thirds of these inspections are carried out without a farm visit and using the technique of remote sensing.</P>
        <P>The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the 18 Statutory Management Requirements (including the Nitrates Directive) or GAEC apply. However at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the Bovine Animal Identification and Registration requirements as this level is prescribed under the relevant Regulations.</P>
        <P>In 2006 the policy of my Department towards on-farm inspections was to give advance notification of up to 48 hours in all cases.  However, this was unacceptable to the European Commission and my Department was obliged to perform a number of inspections without prior notification in 2006. 7,514 farmers had their holdings selected for on-the-spot inspection out of some 130,000 who applied for the Single Payment Scheme (over 100,000 of these are also applicants for Disadvantaged Areas Scheme).  The vast bulk of on farm inspections 6,899 &mdash; 92% of the total farms selected for Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme inspection <Col N="305"/>in 2006 &mdash; were all notified in advance to the farmers concerned.</P>
        <P>A total of 1,421 farmers were subject to cross-compliance penalties under the 2006 Single Payment Scheme while a further 809 farmers, while technically in breach of the requirements, did not suffer any penalty because of the tolerance regime applied by my Department. The total amount withheld under Cross Compliance penalties amounts to &euro;712,799.34 or 0.05% of the &euro;1.3 billion envelope available for the 2006 Single Payment Scheme. The value of both schemes (SPS/DAS) to Irish farmers is some &euro;1.55 billion.</P>
        <P>The EU regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme would allow my Department to give pre-notification of inspection in all cases where certain elements of cross-compliance are involved e.g. the Nitrates Regulations.  However, my Department is committed, in the Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005-2007, to carrying out all Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Area Scheme checks during one single farm visit in most cases.  This then obliges my Department to respect the advance notice requirements applicable to the most stringent element of the inspection regime viz. maximum of 48 hours notice but with no advance notice in a proportion of cases.</P>
        <P>Since the inspection requirements are based on EU regulations applicable throughout the European Union it is my understanding that Member States including Germany, carry out a number of inspections without prior notification.</P>
        <P>I am continuing to pursue a simplification agenda etc at EU level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Twenty-eight cases of Equine Infectious Anaemia (EIA) have been confirmed in Ireland, the most recent on 10 December 2006.  Most of the cases were concentrated, with some exceptions, in the Meath/Kildare/Dublin area with all but three of the cases in thoroughbred horses. 73 days have now elapsed since the last case, significantly longer than the interval between any two other cases.</P>
        <P>A thorough investigation has been carried out in relation to all of the cases and at this stage, my Department is satisfied, based on the significant epidemiological data gathered, that all of the cases can be associated back to events related directly or indirectly to the initial outbreak and is further satisfied that there are veterinary treatment linkages in a number of these cases.</P>
        <P>My Department is also continuing to progress its epidemiological investigation into the circumstances in which the disease was first introduced into the country as part of which officials have travelled overseas to consult with international colleagues.  This investigation is a comprehensive one and an extensive amount of information has been gathered. That information is currently being assessed. It is not possible, at this stage, to say when the investigation will be concluded other than to say that it remains my position, and that of my Department, that if sufficient evidence is gathered to support a prosecution, we will seek to have the case prosecuted through the Courts. I do not intend to comment any further on the matter at this stage.</P>
        <P>At one time or another movement restrictions were placed on 53 separate premises, of which only six remain in place. Two of these are due for de-restriction within days. Assuming no further cases, the last of the restricted premises will be <Col N="308"/>de-restricted by the middle of March, on completion of the necessary testing regime. In all, movement restrictions were imposed on over 1200 individual horses, (the majority of them on their home premises) where their owners were advised by the Department to ensure that they were isolated from contact with other horses. Most of these restrictions have now been lifted and all outstanding restrictions are scheduled to be lifted by mid-March, assuming no new developments.</P>

        <P>Between the Irish Equine Centre (IEC) and the Departments Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (CVRL), over 42,000 samples have been tested for EIA, with still just the twenty-eight positive cases confirmed to-date. Since the beginning of January, the IEC has tested in excess of 14,000 samples, illustrating clearly the level of compliance in the industry with the recommendation of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders&rsquo; Association published in their Codes of Practice for 2007. It&rsquo;s estimated that a further 8,000-10,000 blood samples will be tested by the end of March, bringing to approximately 50,000 the number sampled since the initial outbreak in June 2006.</P>
        <P>It remains the case that any horse owners whose horse(s) shows any clinical symptoms suggestive of EIA should immediately contact their private veterinary practitioner and have arrangements made to have the horse sampled and the sample analysed for the disease.</P>
        <P>Further to its advice to horse owners, my Department is, in view of the apparent veterinary association in a number of the cases, reiterating the advice, consistently given over the past five months, that veterinary practitioners should, at all times, observe the highest standards of hygiene and should ensure that, in all circumstances, contaminated veterinary instruments are either appropriately disposed of or thoroughly sterilised (autoclaved) before reuse.</P>
        <P>From the outset, we have treated  the outbreak of EIA very seriously and have devoted considerable resources in the drive to contain and eradicate the disease and  these efforts will  continue. On-going vigilance will be necessary to ensure the ultimate eradication of the disease and we will continue to work closely with the various elements of the industry, including the breeding, racing, sports horse and sales sectors and are committed to the maintenance of complete confidence in the industry.</P>
        <P>The combination of having had over 14,000 negative test results in January alone, along with the completion of the targeted surveillance programme, has significantly extended my Department&rsquo;s surveillance net and, with a further 8,000-10,000 samples to be tested before the end of March, is providing increasing confidence to the Irish and international equine communities that this outbreak is being contained and very good <Col N="309"/>progress being made towards its eradication. The lengthening intervals between cases over the past three months, and in particular the period to have elapsed since the most recent case, give further comfort and reassurance that the situation in now stable and that the outbreak has been contained.</P>

Increases are made from a current point forward and accordingly the question of paying arrears does not arise.</P>

	<P>The recent investment priorities under the ICT in Schools Programme have been the provision of networking grants to schools and the Schools Broadband Access Programme.  Schools were invited to submit proposals for the development of their networking capability in June 2004 and grants totalling some &euro;23m have since issued to schools.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of broadband connectivity to all recognised schools is being undertaken in partnership with industry, in the context of the joint Government /IBEC &mdash; TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) three year Agreement to fund local connectivity at school level. The broadband connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network supported by HEAnet, in order to provide managed Internet access, email, security controls and content filtering. A broadband support service is being managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network. The overall costs of the Schools Broadband Access Programme, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the three years, are in the region of &euro;30m.</P>
        <P>Under the annual devolved grant scheme for minor works to national schools, all primary schools with full recognition receive a basic grant of &euro;5,500 plus &euro;18.50 per mainstream pupil and &euro;74 per special needs pupil and this grant must be spent on the physical infrastructure of the schools or on items of furniture and equipment for educational use, including IT related equipment.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan contains a provision of &euro;252m for ICT in schools, the essential purpose of which is to advance the embedding of an e-Learning culture in teaching and learning in our schools. I intend to publish a new ICT strategy this year covering the period of the National Development Plan.   As part of the development of this new strategy, it will be necessary to consider and address a wide range of issues including teacher education, teacher professional development, curriculum developments, the maintenance of the national broadband network for schools, the upgrading and renewal of hardware and the provision of software and digital content for learning. The planned investment will also address maintenance and support requirements.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to build on recent investment in networking grants to schools and the Schools Broadband Access Programme in developing the new ICT Strategy, based on the investments outlined in the NDP.</P>

	<P>In order to meet the language needs of students in our schools whose first language is not English, additional support is given to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of posts. </P>
        <P>The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled.  The additional language support to an individual pupil is generally given for a period of two years.</P>
        <P>Schools with between 3 and 13 eligible pupils receive grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time teachers. Schools with 3 to 8 such pupils receive a grant of over &euro;6,300, while schools with between 10 and 13 such pupils receive over &euro;9,500. Over &euro;4 million is being provided for such grants in 2007.</P>
        <P>Schools with 14 or more such pupils are entitled to one or more language support teachers, the number of which has increased dramatically in recent years. There are now approximately 1,250 language support teachers in our schools. More than 400 of these teachers have been allocated in the current school year alone. As I announced last November, 200 extra posts were approved by the Government for 2007, bringing to 1,450 the number of language teachers that will be working in our schools this year. This compares with just 262 posts in the 2001/02 school year.</P>
        <P>In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitments under the &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; partnership agreement, a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009.</P>
        <P>While details as to the schools to which the additional teaching posts will be allocated have yet to finalised, I can assure the Deputy that, in allocating the posts, I will be addressing in particular the position of those schools catering for significant numbers of such children.</P>

	<P>The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.</P>
        <P>Having reviewed a number of applications for home tuition, details regarding the qualifications of some of the proposed tuition providers gave rise to concern. The Deputy will appreciate, that as home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned. The usual requirement is a fully qualified teacher. However, other qualifications are acceptable depending on the individual needs of the child. A comprehensive review of qualifications has taken place in consultation with my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, resulting in a definitive list of qualifications acceptable under the scheme as appropriate to the individual pupils. A list of relevant qualifications may be sourced on my Department&rsquo;s website on www.education.ie.  In this context the clarity that now exists in relation to qualifications should assist the parents concerned in sourcing suitable tutors.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that for the purpose of the home tuition scheme, my Department recognises certain Montessori qualifications.</P>

	<P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 350 on 14th February, 2007, following on the Government decision to close and sell Clancy Barracks, Dublin City Council expressed an interest in having the property made available for affordable and social housing.  Meetings were held between my Department, the City Council and the then Department of the Environment and Local Government. The view of the City Council and the Department of the Environment and Local Government was that the optimal solution would be to sell the land on the open market rather than have it purchased by the Local Authority for housing purposes. </P>
        <P>With regard to the valuation of Clancy Barracks, in February, 2000, the City Council <Col N="318"/>informed my Department that its planning officer had indicated that a large number of buildings on the site were of architectural merit and might be required to be retained on redevelopment. The Council notified the Valuation Office of the report from its planning officer. In March, 2000, the Valuation Office valued the property at about &pound;40 (&euro;50) million. It was pointed out, however, that the actual price to be realised would be determined by the market and the Department was advised by the Valuation Office that, subject to professional advice, it should sell the property by tender or public auction.  The Council was informed of the valuation on 14th April, 2000.</P>
        <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin was offered for sale by public tender in June, 2001.  Two bids were received, one of which was from Dublin City Council. Both tenders were considered too low to permit acceptance and the property remained on the market. Subsequently discussions took place with officials of the then Department of the Environment and Local Government and Dublin City Council.  In the event, Dublin City Council did not proceed to acquire the property on the basis that it was considered that the public interest would be best served from a housing and planning perspective by selling the property on the open market rather than have it purchased by the Local Authority.</P>

        <Quest> if he will investigate complaints of shortcomings in meaningful public consultation and lack of citizens&rsquo; involvement in the decision making procedures in the planning processes, particularly in matters of the rights of land owners or developers versus the rights of citizens resulting in confrontation between the agendas of developers and community concerns regarding heritage and sustainability, most recently typified by the conflict between proposals for high density apartments and the Tallaght community campaigns for a heritage centre in Tallaght village, located in the South Dublin County Council area; his views on amending the Planning Acts to strengthen the <Col N="320"/>rights of communities in such consultation and decision making processes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Planning Acts already provide for extensive consultation in relation to development at all stages of the planning process.  </P>
        <P>Extensive public participation is required in the making of development plans and local area plans.  Before being adopted, a draft development plan must go on public display for at least 10 weeks and anyone may make submissions on it. The local authority must consider these submissions before the plan is adopted.   In addition, any variation of the development plan must go through a further public consultation process.</P>
        <P>When a planning application is made, it is also open to any person, on payment of the prescribed fee, to make a submission to the planning authority.  The authority must, under section 34(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, have regard to any observations or submissions received concerning the proposed development in accordance with the relevant regulations.  Furthermore, any person who makes a submission to the planning authority may appeal the decision of the planning authority to the Board.  Furthermore, An Bord Plean&aacute;la in some instances holds oral hearings in relation to cases being considered by it, further adding to the opportunities to participate in the decision-making process.</P>
        <P>Regarding the reference to development proposals for Tallaght, the Tallaght Town Centre Local Area Plan was adopted by South Dublin County Council on 17 July 2006.  I understand from the Council that there was extensive public consultation and that all relevant provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 were fully complied with.</P>
        <P>I consider that the provisions for public participation set out in the planning acts are sufficiently robust to balance first-party and third-party rights and interests.  Accordingly, I do not propose to amend the provisions concerned at this time.</P>
